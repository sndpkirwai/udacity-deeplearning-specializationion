    "In this project, you'll generate your own [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) TV scripts using RNNs.  You'll be using part of the [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from 9 seasons.  The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,\"fake\" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.\n",

(jerry sits down on the couch. kessler walks over with his sandwich and looks at jerry and uses expressions to ask jerry to move the newspapers on the other side of the couch so he could site down. kessler sits down next to him and starts turning over the pages of a magazine. suddenly he spots an article he likes and tears it out. jerry gives him a look as if to say, do you mind?) are you done with this? \\n\\njerry: no. \\n\\nkessler: when youre done, let me know. \\n\\njerry: yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow. \\n\\nkessler: i thought i wasnt allowed to be in here this weekend. \\n\\njerry: no, its okay now, that, that girl is not coming. uh, i misread the whole thing. \\n\\nkessler: you want me to talk to her? \\n\\njerry: i dont think so. \\n\\nkessler: oh, i can be very persuasive. do you know that i was almost... a lawyer. \\n\\njerry: that close, huh? \\n\\nkessler: you better believe it. \\n\\njerry: hello...oh, hi, laura. \\n\\nkessler: oh, give me it...let me talk to her. \\n\\njerry: (to the phone) no believe me, im always up at this hour. how are you?... great... sure... what time does the plane get in?... i got my friend george to take me... \\n\\nkessler: (to the tv) slide! wow! \\n\\njerry: no, its, its just my neighbor... um... yeah, i got it. (jerry takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on.) ten-fifteen... no, dont be silly, go ahead and ask... yeah, sure... okay, great, no no, its no trouble at all... ill see you tomorrow... great, bye. (he hangs up the phone; to kessler) i dont believe it. that was her. she wants to stay here! \\n\\njerry: if my father was moving this he had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. (as his father) \\'have you got your end?...your ends got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your ends got to come down.\\' \\n\\ngeorge: you know, i cant believe youre bringing in an extra bed for woman that wants to sleep with you. why dont you bring in an extra guy too? \\n\\njerry: look, its a very awkward situation. i dont wanna be presumptuous. \\n\\ngeorge: all right, all right, one more time, one more time! what was the exact phrasing of the request? \\n\\njerry: all right, she said she couldnt find a decent hotel room... \\n\\ngeorge: a decent hotel-room... \\n\\njerry: yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place. \\n\\ngeorge: you cant be serious. this is new york city. there must be eleven million decent hotel rooms! what do you need? a flag? (waving his handkerchief) this is the signal, jerry, this is the signal! \\n\\njerry: (cynical) this is the signal? thank you, mr. signal. where were you yesterday? \\n\\ngeorge: i think i was affected by the caffeine. \\n\\ngeorge: ho, ho, ho, good dog, good dog... \\n\\nkessler: hey, he really likes you, george. \\n\\ngeorge: well, thats flattering. \\n\\nkessler: oh, hes getting a drink of water. (pointing to the mattress) is this for that girl? \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\nkessler: why even give her an option? \\n\\njerry: this is a person i like, its not how to score on spring break. \\n\\ngeorge: right, can we go? cause im double-parked, im gonna get a ticket. \\n\\njerry: yeah, okay. oh, wait a second. oh, i forgot to clean the bathroom. \\n\\ngeorge: so what? thats good. \\n\\njerry: now, how could that be good? \\n\\ngeorge: because filth is good. what do you think, rock stars have sponges and ammonia lying around the bathroom? they, have a woman coming over, ive gotta tidy up? yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. always, always do the opposite. \\n\\njerry: this is how you operate? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, i wish. \\n\\njerry: let me just wipe the sink. \\n\\nkessler: why even give her an option for? \\n\\nkessler: (to george, pointing at the mattress) its unbelievable. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. \\n\\nkessler: hows the real estate-business? \\n\\ngeorge: (feeling awkward) its uh, not bad, its coming along. why? did you need something. \\n\\nkramer: do you handle any of that commercial...real estate? \\n\\ngeorge: well, i might be getting into that. \\n\\nkessler: (slaps george on the arm) you keep me posted! \\n\\ngeorge: im aware of you. (to jerry) all right, lets go (opens the bathroom door) lets go! \\n\\njerry: the dating world is not a fun world...its a pressure world, its a world of tension, its a world of pain...and you know, if a woman comes over to my house, i gotta get that bathroom ready, cause she needs things. women need equipment. i dont know what they need. i know i dont have it, i know that- you know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. this is the one im- always has been one of the amazing things to me...i have no cotton-balls, were all human beings, what is the story? ive never had one...i never bought one, i never needed one, ive never been in a situation, when i thought to myself i could use a cotton-ball right now. i can certainly get out of this mess. women need them and they dont need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, theyre like peat moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? theyre huge and two days later, theyre out, theyre gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? what are you doin with them? the only time i ever see em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, theres two or three, that look like theyve been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, i dont know what happened to them. i once went out with a girl who left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over at my house. i dont know what to do with them, i took them out, i put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. i thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town. lets move on. the dating world is a world of pressure. lets face it a date is a job interview that lasts all night. the only difference between a date and a job interview is not many job interviews is there a chance youll end up naked at the end of it. you know? well, bill, the boss thinks youre the man for the position, why dont you strip down and meet some of the people youll be working with? \\n\\njerry: wouldnt it be great if you could ask a woman what shes thinking? \\n\\ngeorge: what a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what shes thinking. \\n\\njerry: you know, instead, im like a detective. i gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation. \\n\\ngeorge: listen, listen, dont get worked up, cause youre gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane. \\n\\njerry: really? how? \\n\\ngeorge: cause its all in the greeting. \\n\\njerry: uh-huh. \\n\\ngeorge: all right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, thats a good sign. \\n\\njerry: right. \\n\\ngeorge: you know, anything in the, in the lip area is good. \\n\\njerry: lip area. \\n\\ngeorge: you know a hug definitely good. \\n\\njerry: hug is definitely good. \\n\\ngeorge: sure. \\n\\njerry: although what if its one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart? \\n\\ngeorge: thats so brutal, i hate that. \\n\\njerry: you know how they do that? \\n\\ngeorge: thats why, you know, a shake is bad. \\n\\njerry: shake is bad, but what if its the two-hander? the hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes? \\n\\ngeorge: hand sandwich. \\n\\njerry: right. \\n\\ngeorge: i see, well, thats open to interpretation. because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes. \\n\\nlaura: guess who? \\n\\njerry: hey, hey. \\n\\nlaura & jerry: hey! \\n\\njerry: its good to see you. \\n\\nlaura: hi. \\n\\njerry: this is my friend george. \\n\\nlaura: hi, how nice to meet you. \\n\\ngeorge: hi, how are you? \\n\\njerry: this is laura. \\n\\ngeorge: laura, sure. \\n\\njerry: (to laura) i cant believe youre here. \\n\\ngeorge & jerry: ooh yeah, the bags, sure. \\n\\nlaura: oh, thank you. \\n\\njerry: (aside, to george) now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, george? \\n\\ngeorge: yes, the surprise blindfold greeting. that wasnt in the manual, i dont know. \\n\\njerry: so uh, what do you think? \\n\\nlaura: wow! this place isnt so bad. \\n\\njerry: yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road. so uh, make yourself at home. (laura sits down on the couch, takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt.) so uh, can i get you anything? uh, bread, water...salad-dressing? \\n\\nlaura: (laughs) actually, um, do you have any wine? \\n\\njerry: uh, yeah, i think i do. \\n\\nlaura: (referring to a lamp) oh, do you mind if i turn this down? \\n\\njerry: uh, no, yeah, go right ahead. \\n\\nlaura: uh, jerry, uh, i was wandering, would it be possible  and if its not, fine  for me to stay here tomorrow night too? \\n\\njerry: uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why dont you stay? yeah, uh…what is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? are you, are you doing anything? \\n\\nlaura: no, id love to do something. uh, i have my seminar in the morning, then after that im right open. \\n\\njerry: really? what would you like to do? \\n\\nlaura: well... now i know this sounds touristy, but id just love to go on one of those five-hour boat rides around manhattan. \\n\\njerry: (unenthusiastic) yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. (pouring the wine) im just, im really glad youre here. \\n\\njerry: (answering) yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. (to laura) um, its for you. \\n\\nlaura: (to the phone) hello?... hi!... no no it was great, right on time... no, i, im gonna stay here tomorrow...yes, yes its fine... no, were going on a boat ride... dont be silly... im not gonna have this conversation... look, ill call you tomorrow... okay, bye. (she hangs up the phone.) never get engaged. \\n\\njerry: (not excited) youre engaged? \\n\\nlaura: you, you really have no idea what its like until you actually do it. and im on this emotional roller coaster. \\n\\njerry: youre engaged? \\n\\nlaura: you know, i cant believe it myself sometimes. you have to start thinking in terms of we. ugh, its a very stressful situation. \\n\\njerry: (matter-of-factly) youre engaged. \\n\\nlaura: yeah, yeah, hes a great guy... \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\nlaura: you would really like him, you know, i cant wait to get on that boat. \\n\\njerry: me too! \\n\\njerry: i swear, i have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. i dont get it, okay? i, i, i admit, i, im not getting the signals. i am not getting it! women, theyre so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle. men are not subtle, we are obvious. women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? we want women, thats it! its the only thing we know for sure, it really is. we want women. how do we get them? oh, we dont know bout that, we dont know. the next step after that we have no idea. this is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. these are the best ideas weve had so far. the car-horn honk. have you seen men doing this? what is this? the man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks. hey! this man is out of ideas. how does it...? i dont think she likes me. the amazing thing is, that we still get women, dont we? men, i mean, men are with women. you see men with women. how are men getting women, many people wonder. let me tell you a little bit about our organization. wherever women are, we have a man working on the situation right now. now, he may not be our best man, okay, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene. thats why, i think, men get frustrated, when we see women reading articles, like where to meet men? were here, we are everywhere. were honking our horns to serve you better. \\n\\njerry: so, im on line at the supermarket. two women in front of me. one of them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. they both of course choose to pay by the use of the... \\n\\naudience: cheque. \\n\\njerry: cheque. now, the fact is, if its a woman in front of you thats writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. i have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, you know, cause they write out so many cheques. the keys, they can never find in their purse, they dont know where that is, but the cheque book they got that. they never fumble for the cheque book. the cheque book comes out of a holster (jerry draws imaginary book from a holster.) who do i make it out to? theres my id. theres something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine. i dont know exactly what it is. i think to a man, a cheque is like a note from your mother that says, i dont have any money, but if youll contact these people, im sure theyll stick up for me... if you just trust me this one time- i dont have any money but i have these. i wrote on these. is this of any value at all? \\n\\njerry: whats that one? \\n\\nelaine: coccoon ii the return. i guess they didnt like it up there. \\n\\njerry: maybe they came back for chinese food. yknow maureen stapleton, if she gets a craving, shes probably screamin at those aliens, i gotta have a lo mein! \\n\\nelaine: okay, whatre we doing here? i have seen everything. \\n\\njerry: oh yeah? i dont believe youve seen... this. \\n\\nelaine: oh, lovely. \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\nelaine: what do you think their parents think? \\n\\njerry: so, uh, whats your son doing now, dr. stevens? oh, hes a public fornicator. yes, hes a fine boy... \\n\\nelaine: you know what? this would be a really funny gift for pamelas birthday. \\n\\njerry: pamela? do i know her? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, you met her when we were going out. \\n\\njerry: oh yeah, right... \\n\\nelaine: you have no idea who im talking about, do you? \\n\\njerry: (quickly) no. \\n\\nelaine: blonde hair, remember? glasses? (pause) have you totally blocked out the entire time we were a couple? \\n\\njerry: (a lightbulb goes on in his head) riverside drive. \\n\\nelaine: right! in fact... no, never mind... \\n\\njerry: well, what is it? \\n\\nelaine: well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some bar for her birthday, but... (jerry turns in disgust) you dont want to go to... that... no. \\n\\njerry: wait a second, wait a second. we could work out a little deal here. \\n\\nelaine: what little deal? \\n\\njerry: i will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding i have on saturday. \\n\\nelaine: a wedding? have you lost it, man? \\n\\njerry: you know, my parents are coming in for this... \\n\\nelaine: theyre coming in? \\n\\njerry: yeah, tomorrow. \\n\\nelaine: hey, did your father ever get that hair weave? \\n\\njerry: no, no. still doing the big sweep across. \\n\\nelaine: why does he do that? \\n\\njerry: doesnt think anyone can tell. so cmon, do we have a deal? \\n\\nelaine: a wedding? \\n\\njerry: theres a lot of people to mock... \\n\\nelaine: all right, what the hell. \\n\\njerry: great! \\n\\nwoman: when youre dead, youre dead. thats it. youre not going anywhere... \\n\\nelaine: cmon lets go... \\n\\njerry: was i supposed to bring something? \\n\\nelaine: you could have. \\n\\njerry: i met her one time... \\n\\nelaine: it is not necessary. \\n\\njerry: what did you say then? \\n\\nelaine: shh!!! \\n\\npamela: hi \\n\\nelaine: hi, pamela, you remember jerry. \\n\\npamela: (shakes jerry\\'s hand) yes, we met. \\n\\njerry: hi, happy birthday. \\n\\npamela: thanks, ah, everybody, this is elaine and jerry. \\n\\nguests, jerry and elaine: hi \\n\\njerry: i didnt bring anything. \\n\\npamela: uh, i put you two right here. \\n\\njerry: oh, okay (turns to rest of table) im sorry, i didnt know what to bring, nobody told me. \\n\\nvanessa: how big a tip do you think it would take to get him to stop? \\n\\njerry: im in for five... \\n\\nvanessa: ill supply the hat. \\n\\njerry: (thinking) uh-oh... what do we have here? \\n\\nvanessa: why dont you relax and take your jacket off? \\n\\njerry: oh, i cant. uh, i have a tendency to get chilly. \\n\\nvanessa: how masculine. \\n\\njerry: plus im wearing short sleeves, i dont want to expose my tattoos. (vanessa smiles; thinking) shes unbelievable! \\n\\nroger: (to vanessa) hey, this guy says he knows bricker. \\n\\nvanessa: oh, you know bricker! from where? \\n\\njerry: (thinking) whats going on here? gotta be her boyfriend, shes too good to be alone. whats the difference, i cant manouver anyway with elaine next to me. \\n\\nvanessa: (to jerry) how do you know pamela? \\n\\njerry: uh, friend of a friend. and you? \\n\\nvanessa: we went to law school together. \\n\\nelaine: (interrupting jerry\\'s conversation) oh, jerry! \\n\\njerry: (turning to elaine; thinking) oh no, not now. \\n\\nelaine: i had this dream last night and you were in it. \\n\\njerry: oh really? (tries turning away in the hopes elaine gets the hint; thinking) oh god, i gotta get out of this. \\n\\nelaine: you were you, but, you werent you... \\n\\njerry: no kidding. (thinking) why is this happening? please, make her stop! \\n\\nelaine: i think, i think we were in my house where i grew up, and you were standing there, you were looking out the window... \\n\\njerry: (thinking) this is brutal. \\n\\nelaine: you turned around and you had these wooden teeth. \\n\\njerry: how do you like that?

(jerry pretends to drive with one foot in the air, giving the toe.) look at that toe, buddy. (he puts his foot down.) i mean, thats really insulting to get the toe, isnt it? \\n\\njerry: is that it? got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella, something boring to read on the plane. (jerry zips his bag ceremoniously.) thats it. done! \\n\\nelaine: (claps her hands) that is the single greatest packing performance i have ever seen. \\n\\njerry: (proudly) i am...the master packer. \\n\\nelaine: (laughs) yeah, right, youre the master packer. \\n\\njerry: what you must understand, elaine, (picking up the umbrella) packing is no different than leading men into battle. (jerry hits his bag rhythmically with his umbrella.) youve gotta know the strengths and weaknesses of every soldier in that platoon. from a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks. \\n\\nelaine: (raising her hand) scuse me, master packer... \\n\\njerry: yes. \\n\\nelaine: just gimme your keys. \\n\\njerry: all right, sir. (he tosses elaine his keys. the apartment buzzer goes off; jerry presses the first button; to the intercom) george? \\n\\ngeorge: (from the intercom) yeah. \\n\\nelaine: okay, so, now, is there anything else i need to know about this place? \\n\\njerry: uh, yeah, the, uh, hot water takes a little while to come on. so, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all your shopping, you come back and take a shower. \\n\\nelaine: okay, this is quite a place. \\n\\njerry: theres more. the refrigerator. \\n\\njerry: deduct a minimum of two days off all expiration dates. (he uses the umbrella to point to certain compartments in the fridge.) no meat, no leftovers, no butter. (he closes the fridge.) and i cannot overstate this no soft cheeses of any kind. is that clear? \\n\\nelaine: ill eat out. \\n\\njerry: one more thing, benes, regarding sexual activity strictly prohibited, but if you absolutely must, do us all a big favour. do it in the tub. \\n\\ngeorge: (to jerry) ready? \\n\\njerry: yeah, one sec. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, elaine. \\n\\nelaine: hi. \\n\\ngeorge: coming to the airport with us? \\n\\nelaine: no, im staying here for the weekend. im getting a break from my roommate. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, the actress-waitress? \\n\\nelaine: no, the waitress-actress. she just got some part in some dinner theater production of a chorus line. so, now all day long shes walking around the apartment singing, god, i hope i get it, i hope i get it! shes gonna get it right in her... \\n\\ngeorge: so just kick her out. \\n\\nelaine: shes on the lease! george you have got to find another place for me. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, well...a little rough finding something good in your price-range.

(george gives elaine a look while jerrys back is turned. jerry turns around.) i saw that. \\n\\nelaine: you oughta at least take a look at it. \\n\\njerry: really? why? \\n\\nelaine: cause then i could move in here. \\n\\njerry: ohhhh... \\n\\nelaine: its time you got outta here anyway. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, tell im. but quickly, im double parked here. \\n\\nelaine: listen, jerry, this place is falling apart. you have no hot water, you cant have soft cheese... \\n\\ngeorge: lets not forget the radiator. the steam has been on here for ten years. no human can turn this off. \\n\\nelaine: jerry, come on, youre doin okay now. you should at least take a look at this place. you shouldnt have to live like this. \\n\\njerry: like this? you just said you wanted to live here. \\n\\nelaine: well, for me its a step up. its like moving from iceland to finland. \\n\\ngeorge: jerry, what do you, you wanna, you wanna see the place or not? \\n\\njerry: i cant think about it now. come on, im going to minneapolis. i got four shows this weekend. \\n\\njerry: elaine.

(jerry imitates a judge banging his gavel.) he has to call it, case closed. objection overruled. \\n\\ngeorge: i love the mirror in that bathroom! i dont know what in the hell it is. i look terrific in that mirror.

(to jerry, george and elaine) diane gave me the greatest backrub today. shes a masseuse! \\n\\ndiane: how, how could you guys have turned this place down, its such a great location and its...so close to the park. \\n\\ngeorge: were aware of the proximity to the park, yes. \\n\\ndiane: well, it was nice to meet you. \\n\\ngeorge: nice meeting you. \\n\\njerry: how late are the stores open? im thinking of maybe uh, buying a new tv and smash it over my head. \\n\\nman #1: i get a call from gilmour this morning, and get this theyre restructuring the organization in atlanta and i gotta be there on the first of the month. \\n\\nman #2: really? what are you gonna bout the apartment? \\n\\nman #1: well, what can i do? give it up. \\n\\njerry, george & elaine: whats the rent? \\n\\njerry: most men like working on things. tools, objects, fixing things. this is what men enjoy doing. have you ever noticed a guys out in his driveway working on something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. they just come wandering out of the house like zombies. men, its true, men hear a drill, its like a dog whistle. just... (his head perks up) you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, honey, i think jims working on something over there. so they run over to the guy. now they dont actually help the guy. no, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. thats what men want to do. we want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. you know, what are you using, a phillips-head? you know, we feel involved. thats why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, thats just to keep the men out. they cut those little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. but if they dont cut those holes, we are climbing those fences. right over there. what are you using the steel girders down there? yeah, thatll hold. \\n\\ngeorge: i had to say something. (chuckles) i had to say something. everything was going so well. i had to say something. \\n\\njerry: i dont think you did anything wrong. \\n\\ngeorge: i told her i liked her. why? why did i tell her i like her? i have this sick compulsion to tell women how i feel. i like you i dont tell you. \\n\\njerry: we can only thank god for that. \\n\\ngeorge: im outta the picture. i am outta the picture. (laughs) its only a matter of time now. \\n\\njerry: youre imagining this. really. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, no. no no no no. \\n\\ngeorge: ill tell you when it happened. when that floss came flying out of my pocket. \\n\\njerry: what floss? when? \\n\\ngeorge: we were in the lobby during the intermission of the play. i was buying her one of those containers of orange drink, for five dollars. i reached into my pocket to pay for it, i looked down; theres this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers. \\n\\njerry: ah, mint. \\n\\ngeorge: of course. so, im looking at it. i look up, i see shes looking at it. our eyes lock. it was a horrible moment. i just.. \\n\\njerry: so let me get this straight. she saw the floss, you panicked and you told her you liked her. \\n\\ngeorge: if i didnt put that floss in my pocket, id be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses. \\n\\njerry: and youre sure the floss was the catalyst? \\n\\ngeorge: yes, i am. \\n\\njerry: you dont think it mightve had anything to do with that? \\n\\ngeorge: what? you dont like this? \\n\\njerry: it looks like your belt is digesting a small animal. \\n\\nkramer: (to the phone) oh, theyve got a cure for cancer. see, its all big business. oh hey, jerry just walked in. hi, george.

(to jerry) hey, you missed a great game tonight, buddy! \\n\\njerry: game? \\n\\nkramer: knick game. horneck took me. we were sitting two rows behind the bench. we\\'re getting hit by sweat! \\n\\njerry: wait. how does horneck know you? \\n\\nkramer: last week. when i, you know, gave you the phone. hes really into my pizza place idea! \\n\\njerry: this is too much. \\n\\nelaine: wait, what pizza place idea? \\n\\njerry: oh, no. \\n\\nkramer: you get to make your own pie! \\n\\nelaine: oh, that sounds like a great idea. it would be fun. \\n\\nkramer: yea. \\n\\njoel: (from the hallway) kramer. \\n\\nkramer: yeah. \\n\\njerry: perfect. \\n\\njoel: hey. \\n\\nkramer: okay, who wants meatloaf? \\n\\njerry & elaine: no thanks. \\n\\nkramer: (to joel) its gonna be hot in a minute. \\n\\njoel: so, i though you were tutoring your nephew? \\n\\njerry: oh, we finished early. \\n\\njoel: m-hm, ill bet. so, are you going to introduce me to your nephew? \\n\\njerry: elaine benes, this is joel horneck. \\n\\nelaine: hi. \\n\\njoel: whoa, nelson! this is elaine? i though you guys split? \\n\\njerry: were still friends. \\n\\njoel: so, thanks again for those tickets. but next week, im going to take you. how about next tuesday night? (to elaine) and why dont you come along? \\n\\nelaine: oh, no no. tuesdays uh no good becasue weve got choir practice. \\n\\njerry: right. i forgot about choir. \\n\\nelaine: we-were doing that evening of eastern european national anthems. \\n\\njerry: right. you know, the wall being down and everything. \\n\\njoel: what about thursday night? i mean theyre playing the sonics. \\n\\nelaine: huh... thursday is no good because weve got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors. \\n\\njoel: you know, i should really try something like that. \\n\\njerry: you really should. \\n\\njoel: well, lets just take a look here. \\n\\njoel: forty-one home games. let\\'s see saturday night weve got the mavericks. if you dont like the mavericks, next tuesday lakers. i mean, you gotta like magic, right? lets see, on the road, on the road, on the road, on the road, back on the fourteenth. they play the bulls. you cant miss air jordan... \\n\\njerry: you know, i really... ive come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in your life that theyre just always your friends, and you have to accept it. you see them, you dont really wanna see them. you dont call them, they call you. you dont call back, they call again. the only way to get through talking with people that you dont really have anything in common with is to pretend youre hosting your own little talk show. this is what i do. you pretend theres a little desk around you. the only problem with this is theres no way you can say, hey, its been great having you on the show. were out of time. \\n\\njerry: went out to dinner the other night. check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because moneys a very different thing before and after you eat. before you eat, money has no value. and you dont care about money when youre hungry. you sit down at a restaurant, youre like the ruler of an empire. more drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! it will be the greatest meal of our lives. then after the meal, you know, youve got the pants open, youve got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes. then the check comes at that moment. people are always upset, you know. theyre mystified by the check. what is this? how could this be? they start passing it around the table, does this look right to you? were not hungry now. why are we buying all this food? \\n\\njerry: i think superman probably has a very good sense of humor. \\n\\ngeorge: i never heard him say anything really funny. \\n\\njerry: but its common sense. hes got super strength, super speed. im sure hes got super humor. \\n\\ngeorge: you would think that, but either youre born with a sense of humor, or youre not. its not going to change even if you go from the red sun of krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the earth. \\n\\njerry: why? why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of earth? \\n\\ngeorge: i dont know. but he aint funny. \\n\\nelaine: i know, i know. im sorry im late. \\n\\njerry: no problem. \\n\\nelaine: i dropped a grape. \\n\\ngeorge: pardon? \\n\\nelaine: i dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. i couldnt find it. i was, i was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. i have no idea where it went. \\n\\njerry: were you crying? i mean, its just a grape. youll find it. \\n\\nelaine: no, im just getting over an allergy attack. this guy im going out with... \\n\\njerry: robert. \\n\\nelaine: robert. yes. thank you. he has two cats and im allergic to them. you know, i finally meet a normal man, and i cant even go into his apartment, you know. and, of course, my apartment is the actors studio so we cant go there. its really causing a lot of problems, you know. he wont even go away for the weekend because of these cats. \\n\\ngeorge: guys with cats... i dont know. \\n\\njerry: ive been thinking about asking this girl im, uh, seeing- \\n\\nelaine: vanessa. \\n\\njerry: vanessa, thank you. ive been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, no. no no no no no. id have to advise against that. what, do you know this woman a month? lets see, youre going to be with her seventy-two hours. thats a dating decathlon. \\n\\nelaine: (balancing a spoon on her nose) hey, why dont you take her to that place in vermont i was telling you about? you know, that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold. shell love it. \\n\\ngeorge: thats exquisite. listen, uh, if its not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there? \\n\\njerry: you better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. there was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the texas panhandle. they brought in the army, nobody could stop it. apparently it had a pit of steel. \\n\\ngeorge: up again?! this is incredible! im.. im getting it. \\n\\nelaine: youre getting what? \\n\\ngeorge: a stock. \\n\\njerry: what stock? \\n\\ngeorge: did you ever meet my friend, simons? \\n\\njerry: maybe. \\n\\ngeorge: he knows this guy, wilkinson. he made a fortune in the stock market. now hes got some new thing. you know, theres supposed to be a big merger. he wasnt even supposed to say anything. you guys should think about doing this too. \\n\\njerry: how highs it suppose to go? \\n\\ngeorge: i dont know. but simons said that if i wanted to get involved, that wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. you wanna do it? \\n\\njerry: boy... i dont know. \\n\\nelaine: id do it but i dont have any money. \\n\\njerry: what kind of company is it? \\n\\ngeorge: its called sendrax. theyve got some new kind of technique for televising opera. \\n\\nelaine: televising opera? \\n\\ngeorge: some sort of electronic thingy. \\n\\njerry: well, how much are you going to invest? \\n\\ngeorge: five thousand... ten. ten thousand. five thousand. \\n\\njerry: boy... \\n\\ngeorge: cmon. wilkinsons got millions invested in this stock. its gone up three points since ive been watching it. \\n\\njerry: what if i lose it? \\n\\ngeorge: cmon, go for twenty-five hundred. well do it together. come on, come on. were in it together. \\n\\njerry: all right. twenty-five hundred. \\n\\ngeorge: thats it. \\n\\nwaitress: yeah, can i take your order? \\n\\ngeorge: (gesturing to jerry) check the raiser. \\n\\njerry: my bet? all right. ill open with a tuna sandwich. \\n\\nelaine: tuna? \\n\\njerry: oh, the dolphin thing? \\n\\nelaine: theyre dying in the nets. \\n\\njerry: ohhh... you know, the whole concept of lunch is based on tuna. \\n\\nelaine: jerry, cant you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine? \\n\\njerry: hey, when im driving, i let people in ahead of me all the time. im always waving everybody in. go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. ...all right. all right. ill have a chicken salad. \\n\\nelaine: and im going to have an english muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee. \\n\\nwaitress: okay. (to george) what about you? \\n\\ngeorge: ill have the tuna. \\n\\njerry: i have to say, those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me. \\n\\nvanessa: why didnt you do something? \\n\\njerry: what do you want me to do? i gave the guy the half-turn. (acts like he did in the movie) then i gave him the full-turn with the eye roll. (does the next look) i mean, beyond that, im risking a punch in the mouth. (to a stock boy) excuse me, do you have these in the puffs? \\n\\nstock boy: no puffs. just flakes. \\n\\njerry : have you thought any more about that trip? \\n\\nvanessa: yeah, ive been thinking about it. \\n\\njerry: you know, my friend told me about this great place in vermont. \\n\\nvanessa: i dont know. i just worry about trips like this. its a lot of pressure. \\n\\njerry: its great! it speeds up the intimacy level. its like putting the relationship in a time compressor. where we would be six months from now we accomplish (snaps his fingers) three days. \\n\\nvanessa: oh, so you want to move our relationship into phase two? \\n\\njerry: exactly. i love phase two. extra toothbrushes, increased phone call frequency, walking around naked. you know, the presents get a lot better in phase two. \\n\\nvanessa: really? could we go fishing up there? \\n\\njerry: yeah. we can fish. what? blues, carp, marlin? \\n\\nvanessa: they have marlin in vermont? \\n\\njerry: oh, big fighting marlin. (jerry acts like he is catching a marlin) \\n\\nvanessa: jerry, the stock is the same as when you checked it earlier. there are no changes after the market closes. the stock is still down. \\n\\njerry : i know. but this is a different paper. i thought maybe they have, uh, different... sources. \\n\\njerry: is that my paper? \\n\\nkramer: bad news, my friend. \\n\\njerry: what? what news? \\n\\nkramer : sendrax. \\n\\njerry: oh, cmon! its down again?! \\n\\nkramer: two and a half points. \\n\\njerry: oh, i cant believe it. let me see that. (jerry takes the paper.) thats four and a half points in three days! thats almost half my money! \\n\\nkramer: hey, i told you. \\n\\njerry: (sarcastic) yeah, you told me. \\n\\nkramer: its all manipulated with junk bonds. you cant win. \\n\\njerry: theres one thing i dont understand. why does it please you? (to the phone) george costanza, please. \\n\\nkramer: hey, i dont care. im just telling you to (yelling) get rid of that stock, now! \\n\\njerry: (to the phone) george, whats going on?! \\n\\nkramer: sell it, just say im selling! \\n\\njerry: (to the phone) well, where is the guy?!... nothing?! almost half my moneys gone... well, call me right back. (jerry hangs up.) nobody can reach wilkinson. he hasnt been home or in his office in the past three days! \\n\\nkramer: you know, i cant believe you put your money in that sendrax. and you couldve invested in my roll-out tie dispenser. \\n\\njerry: roll-out tie dispenser? what was that one? \\n\\nkramer: okay, youre in a restaurant. youve got a very big meeting coming up... \\n\\njerry: okay... \\n\\nkramer: (looks at his shirt as if he had a tie on) oh man, you got mustard on your tie! \\n\\njerry: (going along with it) oh no! \\n\\nkramer: you just (makes the tearing sound) tear it off, and vvvvrrrpppp you got a new one right here. then youre gone. \\n\\njerry: youre gone all right. \\n\\nkramer: (looking at map) hey, where, where are you going? you gonna take a trip? the map... what... \\n\\njerry: yeah, im going to vermont with uh vanessa for a few days. \\n\\nkramer: hey, can i use your place? i got a bunch of friends coming over this weekend. \\n\\njerry: what friends? \\n\\nkramer: well, its just some people i met at a rock concert. (phone rings.) do you mind if they use your bed? (jerry give kramer a look.) cause theyre really good people, jerry. im telling you. you know, theyre anarchists. theyre.. theyre.. theyre.. huge. \\n\\njerry: george- what?! youre kidding... well, whats wrong?... so, what are we gonna do?... great!... all right, ill speak to you later. (he hangs up.) wilkinson, the guy whos supposed to tell us when to sell the stock, hes in the hospital. \\n\\njerry: so you dont know whats wrong with him? \\n\\ngeorge: all simons was able to find out is that hes in the hospital. \\n\\njerry: okay, fine. has simons been in touch with him? \\n\\ngeorge: of course hes been in touch with him. hes left two messages. he just hasnt heard back yet, thats all. \\n\\njerry: well, this is it. im selling. \\n\\ngeorge: just give it a little more time. \\n\\njerry: i never shouldve gotten involved in this. im a nervous wreck. im not cut out for investing. \\n\\ngeorge: all right, all right. thats it. im gonna go down there. \\n\\njerry: where? \\n\\ngeorge: to the hospital. \\n\\njerry: the hospital? \\n\\ngeorge: im going to find out whats going on. all right? \\n\\njerry: are you nuts? you dont even know the guy. \\n\\ngeorge: so what? ill start talking to him, you know, casual, and ill work my way around to it. \\n\\njerry: what if hes in an iron lung or something? what are you gonna do? (jerry knocks on imaginary glass.) how you feeling, mr. wilkinson? (he makes a hissing sound.) by the way, whats happening with sendrax? \\n\\ngeorge: maybe hes resting. \\n\\njerry: who goes to the hospital to rest? \\n\\ngeorge: what are you, a doctor? \\n\\njerry: okay, fine, fine. when are you going down there? \\n\\ngeorge: today. im going today. just dont do anything until you hear from me. \\n\\njerry: all right. \\n\\ngeorge: (to the woman) boy, i have to get to a bathroom. \\n\\ndry cleaner: (to jerry) may i help you? \\n\\njerry: yeah. i picked up this shirt here yesterday. its completely shrunk. theres absolutely no way i can wear it. \\n\\ndry cleaner: when did you bring it in? \\n\\njerry: whats the difference? look at it! do you see the size of this shirt?! \\n\\ndry cleaner: you got a receipt? \\n\\njerry: i cant find the receipt. \\n\\ndry cleaner: you should get the receipt. \\n\\njerry: look, forget about the receipt, all right? even if i had the receipt- look at it! its a hand puppet. what am i gonna do with this?! \\n\\ndry cleaner: yes, but how do i know we did the shirt? \\n\\njerry: what do you think this is a little scam i have? i take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money? in fact, forget the money. i dont even want the money. i just once, i would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. thats what i want. i want an admission of guilt. \\n\\ndry cleaner: maybe you asked for it to be washed. \\n\\njerry: no! dry-cleaned. \\n\\ndry cleane: let me explain to you something, okay? with certain types of fabrics, different chemicals can react, causing- \\n\\njerry: you shrunk it! you know you shrunk it! just tell me that you shrunk it! \\n\\ndry cleaner: (looks around making sure not too many people are listening) i shrunk it. \\n\\njerry: i think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so i can say to the dry cleaner, well, its ruined. and of course, the dry cleaner can respond, its not our fault. were not responsible. we just ruin the clothes. that ends our legal obligation. you see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible. th-right? theyre cleaning our clothes, but theyre not getting anything wet. its all dry. i know theres gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids that theyre using. theres no such thing as dry cleaning. when you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that (jerry brushes off his shirt.) thats dry cleaning. i dont think thats what theyre doing back there. they dont have eighty guys going, come on, hurry up! theres a lot of shirts today! \\n\\njerry: bless you. \\n\\nelaine: thank you. what evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? huh? what do they do? because theyre clean? i am sorry. my uncle pete showers four times a day and he cant count to ten, so dont give me hygiene. \\n\\njerry : so what are you gonna do? \\n\\nelaine: i dont know. i cant think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. what do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of cats? \\n\\njerry: well, it couldnt be too expensive. thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat? \\n\\nelaine: what do you think, jerry? you wanna make twenty-eight bucks? \\n\\njerry: im no cat killer. \\n\\nelaine: how about we go over there right now and we shave them? \\n\\njerry: id really like to go, elaine. but, george is coming back from the hospital. i gotta wait for him. but otherwise i would definitely go. \\n\\nelaine: he actually went to the hospital? \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\nelaine: oh man, hes nuts. \\n\\njerry: yeah, hes nuts. you wanta bump off a couple of cats. (enter kramer, holding a paper up to jerry.) i know, i know. its down again. \\n\\nkramer: how much are you down altogether? \\n\\njerry: i dont know.. fifteen hundred dollars. \\n\\nkramer: wow. \\n\\njerry: you dont have to say wow. i know its wow. (kramer smiling) and theres that smile again. well, what is that? (intercom buzzes.) its george. \\n\\nkramer: oh, look at this one by the bus stop. jerry, come here. take a look at this. \\n\\njerry: i really dont need to look. \\n\\nkramer: what a body. yeeaahh. thats for me. \\n\\njerry: yeah, and youre just what shes looking for too  a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up. \\n\\nkramer: im gonna go down there and try and talk to her. \\n\\njerry: what? what? did you go down there? (george nods.) did he tell you whats gonna happen? (george shakes his head.) how long were you there? \\n\\ngeorge: fifteen seconds. \\n\\njerry: you told him you knew simons? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, i mentioned simons. next thing i know, im in the parking lot. perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. ill tell you one thing. i dont know what hes got. but for a sick guy, hes very strong. \\n\\njerry: well, thats it. look, im going to vermont. i dont want to think about this. im selling. \\n\\nelaine: didnt work, huh? \\n\\ngeorge: (laughs) not quite. \\n\\nelaine: we-well, what are you gonna do about the stock? \\n\\ngeorge: im keeping it. im going down with the ship. \\n\\njerry: so i know this guy. im getting all my sneakers at a discount now. \\n\\nvanessa: i know. you mentioned it. \\n\\njerry: oh yeah, right. \\n\\njerry: (thinking) oh god. get me out of here. what a mistake. what made me think this would work? and ive still got another day! ive got nothing left to say. wait... wait... got one. (to vanessa) thats a nice watch. do you wind it? \\n\\nvanessa: no, its got a little battery. \\n\\njerry: well, thats good. \\n\\njerry: (thinking) well, the drive home should be a delight. im speeding the whole way. let them throw me in jail. i dont care. (to vanessa) that\\'s the manager? do you want me to see if we can get another room? \\n\\nvanessa: no, its okay. \\n\\njerry: so, i guess you dont find the separate faucets for the hot and cold, charming? \\n\\nvanessa: not especially. \\n\\njerry: well, what do you want to do this afternoon? \\n\\nvanessa: what can we do? its raining. \\n\\njerry: we cold play sorry! we cold play steal the old mans bundle. (vanessa not amused; jerry thinking) maybe i can get an extension cord and hang myself. (to vanessa) what kind of perfume is that youre wearing? \\n\\nvanessa: oh, youve never heard of it. \\n\\njerry: no, what? what kind is it? \\n\\nvanessa: i cant tell you. \\n\\njerry: (thinking) yeah, thats normal. (to a man nearby) excuse me, sir. could i have a look at that business section? \\n\\nvanessa: that stock? i thought you got out of that? \\n\\njerry: i did. im just curious. its been almost a week. i want to check it out. (he finds the stock.) six points? (to vanessa) its up six points! \\n\\nvanessa: i told you not to sell. \\n\\njerry: you did not tell me not to sell. \\n\\nvanessa: i said the market fluctuates. remember? \\n\\njerry: look, vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. everybody knows that. i just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars! \\n\\nvanessa: thats probably why we\\'re- \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nvanessa: forget it. \\n\\njerry: no, what? thats probably why.. \\n\\nvanessa: thats probably why were staying here, because you lost money on the stock. \\n\\njerry: (thinking) so, what am i looking at here? twenty-nine hours to go. well, at least i got plenty of time to find out the name of that perfume... \\n\\ngeorge: (laughing) have something else. cmon, have a little dessert? \\n\\njerry : im good, thanks. \\n\\ngeorge: elaine, get something! its all taken care of. \\n\\nelaine: im kinda full. \\n\\ngeorge: so dont finish it. \\n\\njerry: (acidly) shes full. so, big daddy. im just curious. how much did you clear on your little transaction there, all told? \\n\\ngeorge: i dont like to discuss figures. \\n\\njerry: how much? \\n\\ngeorge: i dont know, what? eight thousand. its a hyundai. get out of here. i told you not to sell. simons made money, wilkinson cleaned up. \\n\\njerry: so, wilkinsons out of the hospital now? \\n\\ngeorge : no. youd be surprised. you dont recover that quickly from a nose job. \\n\\nelaine: oh god. \\n\\njerry: is that still from the cats? \\n\\nelaine: no, i just have a cold. \\n\\njerry: so, what ever happened with that? \\n\\nelaine: i gave him an ultimatum. \\n\\ngeorge: he chose the cats? \\n\\nelaine: theyre very clean animals. \\n\\njerry: i gotta say, thats pretty sad. losing out to a cat. \\n\\nelaine: almost as bad as losing out to a perfume. \\n\\ngeorge: i told you those trips were relationship killers. too bad you cant get your buddy superman to fly around the earth at super speed and reverse time. youd get all the money back, you could have avoided the whole trip to vermont... \\n\\nelaine: superman can go back in time? \\n\\njerry: we went over that. \\n\\ngeorge: pst. (moves in close with elaine and jerry) wilkinsons got a bite on a new one. petramco corp. out of, uh springfield. i think. theyre about to introduce some sort of a robot butcher. \\n\\njerry: a robot butcher? \\n\\ngeorge: shhhhh. if you want to get in, theres very little time. (calling to the waitress) sweetheart.. (waitress approaches and tears off a check. george stops her.) no, no, no. that ought to cover it.

(snaps his fingers) its all mental. \\n\\njerry: fifty years they were married. now hes moving to pheonix. \\n\\nelaine: phoenix? whats happening with his appartment? \\n\\njerry: i dont know. theyve been in there since, like, world war ii. the rents three hundred a month. \\n\\nelaine: three hundred a month? oh, my god. \\n\\neulogist: although this may seem like a sad event, it should not be a day of mourning. for manya had a rich, fulfilling life. she grew up in a different world  a simpler world  with loving parents, a beautiful home in the country, and from what i understand, she eve had a pony. (jerry throws up his hands.) oh, how she loved that pony. even in her declining years, whenever she would speak of it, her eyes would light up. its lustrous coat, its flowing mane. it was the pride of krakow. \\n\\njerry: well, the games starting just about now. \\n\\nhelen: it was good that the two of you came. it was a nice gesture. \\n\\nnephew: im not a doctor yet, uncle morty. im just an intern. i cant write a note to an airline. \\n\\nmorty: youve got your degree. they dont care. they just want to see something. \\n\\njerry: i just wanted to say how sorry i was... \\n\\nuncle leo: jerry, you wanna hear something? your cousin, jeffrey, is switching parks. theyre transferring him to riverside - so hell completely revamp that operation, you understand? \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\nuncle leo: hell do in riverside what he did in central park. more money. so, thats your cousin. \\n\\nmorty: you dont understand, ive never paid a full fare. \\n\\njerry: once again, i just want to say how sorry i am about the other night. \\n\\nelaine: oh, me too. \\n\\nisaac: oh, no no no. she forgot all about that. she was much more upset about the potato salad. \\n\\nelaine: so, i understand youre moving to phoenix? \\n\\nisaac: yeah, my brother lives there. i think manya wouldve liked phoenix. \\n\\nelaine: mmm, gorgeous, exquisite town. so, whats happening with your apartment? \\n\\nisaac: of course its very hot there. ill have to get uh air conditioner. \\n\\nelaine: oh, you can have mine. ill ship it out to you.

(trying to get through to him) whats happening with your apartment? \\n\\nisaac: i dont even know if i should take my winter clothing. \\n\\nelaine: i have an idea. leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and ill watch it for you and ill live there and ill make sure that nothing happens to it. \\n\\nisaac: oh, the apartment. jeffreys taking the apartment. \\n\\nelaine: oh, jeffrey. \\n\\njerry: you know jeffery? \\n\\nelaine : yeah, from what i understand, he works for the parks department. \\n\\nhelen: its raining. \\n\\njerry: its raining? its raining. the game will be postponed. well play tomorrow. \\n\\nmorty: believe me, i wouldnt bother you if the army hadnt closed that base in sarasota. here, scribble a little something here. \\n\\nnephew: i cant. ill get in trouble. \\n\\nmorty: oh, for gods sake! \\n\\ngeorge: who gets picked off in softball? its unheard of. \\n\\njerry: its never happened to me before. \\n\\nelaine: i remember saying to myself, why is jerry so far off the base? \\n\\njerry: ill have to live with this shame for the rest of my life. \\n\\ngeorge: and then in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly? \\n\\njerry: i thought there were two outs. \\n\\nelaine: i couldnt believe it when i saw you running. (laughing) i thought maybe they had changed the rules or something. \\n\\njerry : it was the single worst moment of my life. \\n\\ngeorge: (smiling) what about sharon besser? \\n\\njerry: oh, well, of course. nineteen-seventy-three. \\n\\nelaine: makes you wonder, though, doesnt it? \\n\\njerry: wonder about what? \\n\\nelaine: you know... (looking up) the spirit world. \\n\\njerry: you think manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me? \\n\\nelaine: i never saw anyone play like that. \\n\\njerry: but i went to the funeral. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, but that doesnt make up for killin her. \\n\\ngeorge: maybe manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day. \\n\\njerry: dont you think she woulda heard i was there? \\n\\ngeorge: not necessarily. \\n\\njerry: who figures and immigrants gonna have a pony? \\n\\njerry: what is the pony? what is the point of the pony? why do we have these animals, these ponies? what do we do with them? besides the pony ride. why ponies? what are we doing with them? i mean, police dont use them for, you know, crowd control. (jerry crouches down, and makes like hes riding a pony.) hey, uh, you wanna get back behind the barricades. hey! hey, little boy. yeah, im talking to you. behind the barricades! so somebody, i assume, genetically engineered these ponies. do you think they could make them any size? i mean, could they make them like the size of a quarter, if they wanted? that would be fun for monopoly, though, wouldnt it? just have a little pony and you put him on the... baltic, thats two down, go ahead. hold it. right there. baltic. yeah, thats it. fine. right there, hold it right there. \\n\\njerry: i hate clothes, okay? i hate buying them. i hate picking them out of my closet. i cant stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. i think eventually fashion wont even exist. it wont. i think eventually well all be wearing the same thing. cause anytime i see a movie or a tv show where theres people from the future or another planet, theyre all wearing the same thing. somehow they decided, this is going to be our outfit. one-piece silver jumpsuit, v-stripe, and boots. thats it. we should come up for an outfit for earth. an earth outfit. we should vote on it. candidates propose different outfits. no speeches. they walk out, twirl, walk off. we just sit in the audience and go, that was nice. i could wear that. \\n\\njerry : i think ive seen enough. \\n\\nsalesman: well, i might have something in the back. \\n\\nelaine: the back? they never find anything in the back. if they had anything good in the back, theyd put it out in the front. \\n\\njerry: why dont they open up an entire store for the back? call it, just back. all back; no front. you walk in the front, youre immediately in the back. (jerry picks up a tie display, and shakes it rhythmically from left to right.) look, elaine, tie carwash. \\n\\ncustomer: oh, i just read that. thats terrific. \\n\\njerry: (pointing to elaine) her father wrote that. \\n\\ncustomer: alton benes is your father? \\n\\nelaine: yeah. \\n\\ncustomer: i always felt he deserved a wider audience. \\n\\nelaine: im not so sure he wants one. \\n\\nelaine: hey, dont forget sunday, okay? you and george are coming, right? hotel westbury, eight oclock. \\n\\njerry: i guess im coming. i mean... \\n\\nelaine: what? what, you dont want to go now? \\n\\njerry: no, ill go. im going. \\n\\nelaine: no, jerry, you have to. i need a buffer. you know, i havent seen my father in a while and... you know... \\n\\njerry: im worried i wont be able to talk to him. hes such a great writer. frankly, i prefer the company of nitwits. \\n\\nelaine: so, thats why were not together anymore. \\n\\njerry: what is this? \\n\\njerry: this is beautiful. these jackets never fit me right. \\n\\nelaine: try it on. \\n\\nelaine: wow, this is soft suede. \\n\\njerry: this may be the most perfect jacket i have ever put on. \\n\\njerry: how much is it? \\n\\nelaine: (shocked) oh my god. \\n\\njerry: bad?

(elaine sits in altons chair and takes a deep breath.) so hows everything going over here? \\n\\njerry: great. \\n\\ngeorge: couldnt be better. \\n\\nelaine: good. cause dad can make some people a little uncomfortable. \\n\\njerry: oh, no, no. \\n\\ngeorge: get outta here.. \\n\\nelaine: man, kramer! i could kill him! \\n\\njerry: i cant believe it. you know better than to get involved with kramer. \\n\\nelaine : he said hed give me a lift. \\n\\njerry: ah, the lift. like the lure of the sirens song. never what it seems to be, yet who among us can resist? \\n\\ngeorge: where do you come up with this stuff? \\n\\nalton: well, look whos here. \\n\\nelaine: oh, hi, dad. \\n\\nalton: hello, dear. \\n\\nalton: whos the lipstick for? \\n\\nelaine: no one. \\n\\nalton: hows your mother? \\n\\nelaine: fine. \\n\\nalton: how about you? are you working? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, im reading manuscripts for pendant publishing. i told you ten times. \\n\\nalton: pendant! those bastards. well all right, boys. well go to that pakistani restaurant on 46th street. youre not afraid of a little spice, are you? \\n\\ngeorge: (singing) master of the house/doling out the charm/ready with a handshake and an open... \\n\\nalton: pipe down, chorus boy. \\n\\nelaine: ohh... its snowing. its beautiful. \\n\\njerry: (to george) snow. snow, that cant be good for suede, can it? \\n\\ngeorge: i wouldnt think so. \\n\\njerry: what should i do?

(kramer enters the bathroom, and sees the garment.) ohhh. what did you do to it? \\n\\njerry: i was out in the snow last night. \\n\\nkramer: dont you know what that does to suede? \\n\\njerry: i have an idea. (elaine enters; to elaine) we can make the nine-thirty at cinema three. \\n\\nelaine: okay. (to kramer) hello. (to jerry) listen, thanks again for coming last night. dad said he had a great time. \\n\\njerry: is he still in town? \\n\\nelaine: no, hes driving back to maryland tonight. \\n\\nkramer: so, uh... what are you gonna do with that one now? \\n\\njerry: i dont know. \\n\\nkramer: (smiling) well... \\n\\nelaine: (to jerry) i didnt want to tell you this, but usually he hates everyone. \\n\\njerry: really? \\n\\nkramer: you gonna throw this out? \\n\\njerry: well, i cant wear it. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, he like you though. said you reminded him of somebody he knew in korea. \\n\\nkramer: (to jerry) well, if youre just gonna throw it out, you know, i could take it. \\n\\njerry: yeah, go ahead, take it. \\n\\nelaine: dad thinks george is gay. \\n\\njerry: oh, because of all the singing? \\n\\nelaine: no, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay. \\n\\nkramer: hey, see, i like it like this. \\n\\nelaine: isnt that...? (jerry nods.) oh, is this from the snow last night? (jerry nods.) ugh... you know what you shouldve done? you shouldve turned it inside out. \\n\\njerry: ill try and remember that. \\n\\nkramer: boy, its too bad you gave me this one too. \\n\\njerry: yeah, too bad. \\n\\nkramer: im gonna have to do something about this lining. \\n\\nalton: (singing) master of the house/doling out the charm/ready with a handshake and an open palm... \\n\\njerry: i had a leather jacket that got ruined. now, why does moisture ruin leather? i dont get this. arent cows outside most of the time? i dont understand it. when its raining do cows go up to the farmhouse, let us in, were all wearin leather. open the door! were gonna ruin the whole outfit here! is it suede? i am suede, the whole thing is suede, i cant have this cleaned. its all i got! \\n\\njerry: the bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what youre doing. you ever see anybody on tv like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their face? some people have a little too much fun on television. the soda commercial people. where do they summon this enthusiasm? have you seen them? we have soda, we have soda, we have soda, jumping, laughing, flying through the air. its a can of soda! have you ever been standing there and youre watching tv and youre drinking the exact same product that theyre advertising right there on tv, and its like, you know, theyre spiking volleyballs, jet-skiing, girls in bikinis and im standing there, maybe im putting too much ice in mine. \\n\\ngeorge: (excited) so then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there, and she was sort of smiling at me, and i wasnt sure if she wanted me to ask her out, because when women smile at me i dont know what it means. sometimes i interpret it like theyre psychotic or something and i dont know if im supposed to smile back, i dont know what to do. so i just stood there like  remember how quayle looked when benson gave him that kennedy line? thats what i looked like. \\n\\njerry: so you didnt ask? \\n\\ngeorge: no, i froze. \\n\\njerry: counter. \\n\\ngeorge: oh yeah. so wait, wait. a half-hour later im back in the office, i tell lloyd the whole story. he says, so why dont you call her? i says, i cant. i couldnt, i couldnt do it right then. for me to ask a woman out i gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks. so lloyd calls me a wuss. \\n\\njerry: he said wuss? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. anyway, he shamed me into it. \\n\\njerry: so you called. \\n\\ngeorge: right. and, and to cover my nervousness i started eating an apple, because i think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it makes you sound casual. \\n\\njerry: yeah. like a farm boy. \\n\\ngeorge: right. so i call her up, i tell her its me, she gives me an enthusiastic hi! \\n\\njerry: wow. the enthusiastic hi. thats beautiful. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, i dont get the enthusiastic hi, im outta there. \\n\\njerry: all right, so youre chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic hi... go ahead. \\n\\ngeorge: so, were talking, and i dont like to go too long before i ask them out, i wanna get it over with right away, so i just blurt out, what are you doing saturday night? \\n\\njerry: and? \\n\\ngeorge: she bought. \\n\\njerry: great day in the morning. \\n\\ngeorge: then i got off the phone right away. \\n\\njerry: sure, its like robbing a bank. you dont loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money. you come in, you hit and get out. \\n\\ngeorge: its amazing. we, we both have dates on the same night. i cant remember the last time that happened. \\n\\ngeorge: i cant stand doing laundry. thats why i have forty pairs of underwear. \\n\\ncarol: you do not. \\n\\ngeorge: absolutely. because instead of doing a wash, i just keep buying underwear. my goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. that way, i only have to do wash once a year. \\n\\njerry: (in an attempted scottish accent) come on, try it. let me hear you try a scottish accent. \\n\\ndonna: thats irish. \\n\\njerry: irish, scottish, whats the difference, lassie? \\n\\ncarol: so, uh, thanks for dinner. it was great. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. (clears his throat) we should do this again. \\n\\ncarol: would you like to come upstairs for some coffee? \\n\\ngeorge: oh, no, thanks. i cant drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up. \\n\\ncarol: (confused by his response) so, um, okay. \\n\\ngeorge: okay. \\n\\ncarol: goodnight. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, take it easy. \\n\\ndonna: thanks again for the movie. \\n\\njerry: youre welcome. \\n\\ndonna: id invite you up, but the place is being painted. \\n\\njerry: oh, thats okay. \\n\\ndonna: unless you want to go to your place. \\n\\njerry: okay... but theres no cake or anything, if thats what youre looking for. \\n\\ngeorge: (frustrated) take it easy! huh! take it easy! \\n\\njerry: i think if ones going to kill oneself, the least you could do is leave a note. its common courtesy. i dont know. thats just the way i was brought up. \\n\\ndonna: values are very important. \\n\\njerry: oh, so important. so what are you doing uh thursday night? you wanna have dinner? \\n\\ndonna: thursdays great. \\n\\njerry: tan pants. why do i buy tan pants, donna? i dont feel comfortable in them. \\n\\ndonna: are those cotton dockers? \\n\\njerry: oh, i cant begin to tell you how much i hate that commercial. \\n\\ndonna: really? i like that commercial. \\n\\njerry: you like that commercial? \\n\\ndonna: yeah, its clever. \\n\\njerry: now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing around, supposedly being very casual and witty? \\n\\ndonna: yeah, thats the one. \\n\\njerry: what could you possibly like about that? \\n\\ndonna: i dont know. i like the, guys. \\n\\njerry: yeah, theyre so funny and so comfortable with each other, and i could be comfortable too, if i had pants like that. i could sit on a porch and wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session. \\n\\ndonna : hey, i know guys like that. to me the dialogue rings true. \\n\\njerry: even if the dialogue did ring true. (donna starts to get annoyed that jerry won\\'t let the conversation go) even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with the pants? doesnt that bother you? \\n\\ndonna: (annoyed) thats the idea. thats whats clever about it, that theyre not talking about the pants. \\n\\njerry: but theyre talking about nothing. \\n\\ndonna: thats the point. \\n\\njerry: i know the point. \\n\\ndonna: no one is telling you to like it. \\n\\njerry: i mean, all those quick shots of the pants. just pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. what is that supposed to be? \\n\\njerry: whats brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through. because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them. you know, like the guyll be like, i dont think her eyebrows are even. could i look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life? and of course the womans looking at the guy, thinking, what is he looking at? do i want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my life? \\n\\njerry: im supposed to see her again on thursday, but can i go out with someone who actually likes this commercial? \\n\\nelaine: i once broke up with a guy because he didnt keep his bathroom clean enough. \\n\\njerry: no kidding. did you tell him that was the reason? \\n\\nelaine: oh yeah, i told him all the time. you would not have believed his tub. germs were building a town in there  they were constructing offices. houses near the drain were going for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars. \\n\\nelaine: hi. \\n\\njerry: youre still thinking about this? \\n\\ngeorge: she invites me up at twelve oclock at night, for coffee, and i dont go up. no thank you. i dont want coffee. it keeps me up. too late for me to drink coffee. i said this to her. people this stupid shouldnt be allowed to live. i cant imagine what she must think of me. \\n\\njerry: she thinks youre a guy that doesnt like coffee. \\n\\ngeorge: she invited me up. coffees not coffee, coffee is sex. \\n\\nelaine: maybe coffee was coffee. \\n\\ngeorge: coffees coffee in the morning. its not coffee at twelve oclock at night. \\n\\nelaine: well some people drink coffee that late. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, people who work at norad, whore on twenty-four hour missile watch. everything was going along so great. she was laughing, i was funny... i kept saying to myself, keep it up, dont blow it, youre doing great. \\n\\nelaine: its all in your head. all she knows is she had a good time. i think you should call her. \\n\\ngeorge: i cant call her now. its too soon. im planning a wednesday call. \\n\\nelaine: oh, why? i love it when guys call me the next day. \\n\\ngeorge: of course you do, but youre imagining a guy you like, not a guy who goes, oh no, i dont drink coffee late at night. if i call her now, shes gonna think im too needy. women dont wanna see need. they want a take-charge guy  a colonel, a kaiser, a tsar. \\n\\nelaine: all shell think is that you like her. \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s exactly what i\\'m trying to avoid! \\n\\nelaine: well, she wants you to like her. \\n\\ngeorge: yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me. but she doesnt like me! \\n\\nelaine: i dont know what your parents did to you. \\n\\nkramer: hey, i just thought of a really funny thing for your act. all right, youre up there, youre on the stage and you go, hey, you ever notice how cars here in new york, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore. someones in a life-and-death situation, and were thinking, well, sorry buddy, you shouldve thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years. \\n\\nkramer: so you gonna use it? \\n\\njerry : i dont think so. \\n\\nkramer: its funny. \\n\\nelaine: it is funny. \\n\\njerry: i like to use my own material. \\n\\nkramer: thats as good as anything you do. \\n\\ngeorge: all right, i gotta make a call. everybody out, come on. \\n\\njerry: why do we have to leave? \\n\\ngeorge: because i cant call a woman with other people in the room. come on, lets go. \\n\\nelaine: oh, see, this is the problem. \\n\\njerry: youre kicking me out of my house? \\n\\ngeorge: yes. \\n\\nelaine: (encouraging) dont forget. \\n\\ngeorge: (to elaine) right, alright.

(carol, george and jerry head for the door. carol opens it.) oh, i forgot to tell you. after i talked to you today my neighbour called me and played my messages to me over the phone. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, uh... \\n\\ncarol: yours were hilarious, we were both cracking up. i just love jokes like that. \\n\\njerry: i love my phone machine. i wish i was a phone machine. i wish if i saw somebody on the street i didnt want to talk to, i could go, excuse me, im not in right now. if you would just leave a message, i could walk away. i also have a cordless phone, but i dont like that as much, because you cant slam down a cordless phone. you get mad at somebody on a real phone  you cant talk to me like that! bang! you know. you get mad at somebody on a cordless phone  you cant talk to me like that! \\n\\njerry: well, i painted my apartment again. ive been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time i paint it, it kinda gets me down. i look around, and i think, well, its a little bit smaller now. you know, i realize its just the thickness of the paint, but im aware of it. it just coming in and coming in. every-time i paint it, its closer and closer. i dont even know where the wall outlets are anymore. i just look for like a lump with two slots in it. kinda looks like a pig is trying to push his way through from the other side. thats where i plug in. my idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the starship enterprise. you know what i mean? big chair, nice screen, remote control... thats why star trek really was the ultimate male fantasy. just hurtling through space in your living room, watching tv. thats why all the aliens were always dropping in, because kirk was the only one that had the big screen. they came over friday nights, klingon boxing, gotta be there. \\n\\njerry: what did you do? \\n\\nkramer: mousse. i moussed up. \\n\\nelaine: i guess it was just a matter of time. \\n\\nkramer: you know, i should\\'ve done this years ago. i mean, i feel like i\\'ve had two lives. my pre-mousse. and now, i begin my post-mousse. hey, tell me the truth, have you ever seen a better looking guy? \\n\\njerry: well, looks are so subjective. \\n\\nelaine: i dont mean to interrupt or anything, but on sunday, my friend is having a brunch for the new york marathon. \\n\\nkramer: (annoyed that he forgot) oh, i keep forgetting to enter that! \\n\\nelaine: she lives right above first avenue, says she has a perfect view of the race. and she said i can invite some friends. \\n\\njerry: maybe. \\n\\nharold: (o.s.) no, im not going up there. \\n\\njerry: (to elaine) harold and manny. \\n\\nharold: im not going. \\n\\njerry: boys, boys. \\n\\nharold: oh, jerry. \\n\\njerry: i slid the rent under your door, harold. did you get it? \\n\\nharold: yeah, yeah... hey, jerry, would you like anything from mrs. hudwalkers apartment? \\n\\nmanny: (in spanish) you can\\'t give him anything from there! \\n\\nharold: i was only joking. (to jerry) he thinks im gonna give you mrs. hudwalkers things. \\n\\nmanny: (in spanish) you offered them to him. \\n\\nharold: (to jerry) we have to go up there now and clean the apartment. its a good thing her rent was overdue. shed be rotting up there for a month. \\n\\njerry: she died? mrs. hudwalker died? \\n\\nharold: ninety-four years old. i found her yesterday. she didnt have her wig on. it was horrifying. \\n\\nmanny: (in spanish) harold, come on, hurry up! \\n\\nharold: (to manny) whats the matter with you? im talking! so, jerry, you know anyone who needs an apartment? \\n\\njerry: are you kidding? you know my friend elaine? \\n\\nharold: oh yeah, i like her. she always says hello to me. \\n\\njerry: its not promised to anybody? cause shed take it in a second. \\n\\nharold: well, manny wanted it for his brother, but he got deported. \\n\\nmanny: (in spanish) what do you mean deported? it was a misunderstanding with the department of immigration. \\n\\nharold: whats the difference? its true! \\n\\njerry: so, its okay? i could just tell her she can have it? \\n\\nharold: sure, sure. shes getting a bargain, too. its only four hundred dollars a month. \\n\\nmanny: (in spanish) four hundred dollars? what are you nuts? someone will pay more. \\n\\nharold: okay... \\n\\nharold: okay! \\n\\nkramer: hey, harold, what do you think? \\n\\nharold: manny, look. kramer put mousse in his hair. \\n\\nmanny: (in spanish) it looks worse. \\n\\nkramer: (not understanding him) hey, thanks. \\n\\nelaine: what was that all about? \\n\\njerry: (coyly) oh, nothing important. \\n\\nelaine: whats going on? what is that look? \\n\\njerry: what look? nothing. \\n\\nelaine: somethings going on here. \\n\\njerry: i dont know if you should sit for this or not. sitting is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down. i cant decide. \\n\\nelaine: jumping up and down? what are you talking about? cmon. cough it up. \\n\\njerry: oh, elaine. you know the way i am  rarely ever thinking of myself. my only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. sure, it hurts sometimes to give, and give, and give... \\n\\nelaine: would you please? \\n\\njerry: what would you say if i told you that... \\n\\nelaine: told me what?! \\n\\njerry: ...i got you an apartment in this building. \\n\\nelaine: (dumbfounded) no. \\n\\njerry: yes. \\n\\nelaine: no. \\n\\njerry: yes. \\n\\nelaine: you didnt. \\n\\njerry: i did. \\n\\nelaine: you got me an apartment in the building?! \\n\\njerry: i got you an apartment in the building. \\n\\nelaine: how did you... \\n\\njerry: remember mrs. hudwalker? the ninety-four-year-old woman who lived above me? \\n\\nelaine: no. \\n\\njerry: she died. \\n\\nelaine: (thrilled) she died?! \\n\\njerry: she died. \\n\\nelaine: she died! \\n\\njerry: and the rent is only four hundred dollars a month! \\n\\nelaine: get out! \\n\\nelaine: four hundred a month? only four hundred a month?! \\n\\njerry: four hundred a month. \\n\\nelaine: and ill be right upstairs? \\n\\njerry: right upstairs. \\n\\nelaine: right above you? \\n\\njerry: right above me. \\n\\nelaine: oh, were neighbors. ill be here all the time! \\n\\njerry: all the time. \\n\\nelaine: (overly excited) we can exchange keys so we can come in and out. oh, this is going to be great! \\n\\njerry: all the time. \\n\\njerry: the problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. i think life would be a lot better if it was like youre always making a movie. you mess up, somebody just walks on the set, and stops the whole shot. you know what i mean? think of the things you wish you could take back. youre out somewhere with people, gee, you look pregnant.. are you? cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, thats not gonna work at all. walk out the door, and come back in. lets take this whole scene again. people, think about what youre saying! \\n\\ngeorge: thanks, see you later, donna. \\n\\ngeorge: what happened to you? \\n\\njerry: you cant believe what i just did. \\n\\ngeorge: what? what did you do? \\n\\njerry: i could tell you what i did, but you wouldnt believe it. its not believable. \\n\\ngeorge: what did you do? \\n\\njerry: how could i have done that? \\n\\ngeorge: done what? \\n\\njerry: i told elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. shes going to move in. \\n\\ngeorge: elaines moving into your building? \\n\\njerry: yes. right above me. \\n\\ngeorge: right above you? \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: youre gonna be neighbors. \\n\\njerry: i know. neighbors. \\n\\ngeorge: shes right above you? \\n\\njerry: right above me. \\n\\ngeorge: how could you do that? \\n\\njerry: cause im an idiot! you may think youre an idiot, but with all due respect, im a much bigger idiot than you are. \\n\\ngeorge: dont insult me, my friend. remember who youre talking to. no ones a bigger idiot than me. \\n\\njerry: did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building? \\n\\ngeorge: did you ever go to a singles weekend in the poconos? \\n\\njerry: shes right in my building! right above me! every time i come in the building, im gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar. \\n\\ngeorge: youre doomed. youre gonna have to have all your sex at womens apartments. itll be like a permanent road trip. forget about the home bed advantage. \\n\\njerry: but i need the home bed advantage. \\n\\ngeorge: of course. we all do. \\n\\njerry: come in for two minutes and sit with me. \\n\\ngeorge: i was just in there. its embarrassing. \\n\\njerry: oh, whos gonna know? \\n\\ngeorge: they saw me walk out. \\n\\njerry: two minutes. \\n\\njerry: my censoring system broke down. you know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? makes sure you dont make a mistake? he went for a cup of coffee. and in that second ruined my life. \\n\\ngeorge: my censor quit two years ago. he checked into a clinic. emotionally exhausted. \\n\\njerry: so, is there any way out of this elaine thing? \\n\\ngeorge: tough. \\n\\njerry: you know, the water pressures terrible in my building. and she loves a good shower. \\n\\ngeorge: i never heard of anyone would turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray. \\n\\njerry: if they were fanatic about showers, they might. \\n\\ngeorge: for that rent, shed take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to. \\n\\njerry: look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. isnt that child abuse? \\n\\ngeorge: id like to have a kid. of course, you have to have a date first... remember my friend, adam, from detroit? \\n\\njerry: yeah, the guy with the flat head. \\n\\ngeorge: hes a cube. anyway, he got married six months ago. he told me ever since hes been wearing a wedding band, women have been coming on to him everywhere he goes. \\n\\njerry: yeah, ive heard that about wedding bands. \\n\\ngeorge: i wonder if thats really true. \\n\\njerry: that would be an interesting sociological experiment. you know, kramer has his fathers band. hed loan it to you. \\n\\ngeorge: thanks a lot. ill give it back to you in a week. \\n\\nkramer: you know, i dont even know why youre fooling around with this ring. ive been telling you, get yourself some plugs. or a piece. \\n\\ngeorge: im not doing that. \\n\\nkramer: oh, man. you know, youre crazy. youre a good looking guy. what do you want to walk around like that for? \\n\\ngeorge: no, ill put half a can of mousse in my head like you. \\n\\nharold: i told you i dont like these sponges, theyre too small! i want a big sponge! \\n\\nharold: you cant pick up anything with these! theres no absorption! \\n\\njerry: boys, boys. \\n\\nharold: hi, jerry. \\n\\nmanny: hello, jerry. (in spanish to harold) you tell him. \\n\\nharold: okay \\n\\nmanny: (in spanish to harold again) you tell him. \\n\\nharold: your friend cant have the apartment, jerry. \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nharold: because somebody offered manny five thousand dollars for the apartment. i dont want to do it. manny wants to do it. \\n\\nmanny: (in spanish) why are you telling him it\\'s my fault? \\n\\nharold: because its true! why shouldnt i tell him? \\n\\njerry: hey, hey. i understand. youre businessmen. \\n\\nmanny: (in spanish) tell him that if his friend can come up with the same money then she can have the apartment. \\n\\nharold: oh, now, he says that if your friend has five thousand dollars, well give it to her. \\n\\njerry: well, thats a lot of money. but, if thats the way its gotta be, thats the way its gotta be. \\n\\njerry: you know, i used to think that the universe is a random, chaotic sequence of meaningless events, but i see now that there is reason and purpose to all things. \\n\\ngeorge: what happened to you? \\n\\njerry: religion, my friend, thats what happened to me. because, i have just been informed that its going to cost elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the apartment upstairs. \\n\\ngeorge: (jubilant) five thousand dollars? she doesnt have five thousand dollars! \\n\\njerry: of course she doesnt have five thousand dollars! \\n\\ngeorge: so, she cant get the apartment. \\n\\njerry: cant get it. \\n\\ngeorge: so, she doesnt move in. \\n\\njerry: no move. so, you see, its all part of a divine plan. \\n\\ngeorge: and how does the baldness fit into that plan? \\n\\njerry: (to the intercom) elaine? \\n\\nelaine: yeah. \\n\\njerry: (to george) all right, this is going to require some great acting now. i have to pretend im disappointed. youre going to really see me being a phony, now. i hope you can take this. maybe you should go in the other room. \\n\\ngeorge: are you kidding? i lie every second of the day. my whole life is a sham! \\n\\njerry: cause you know, i love elaine. \\n\\ngeorge: of course you do. \\n\\njerry: but you know... not in the building. really, i feel terrible about this. my intentions were good. what can i do? tell me. \\n\\nelaine: (to someone in the hallway) no, ill be seeing you. (she enters the apartment; singing) \"good morning, good morning.. (to jerry and george) have you ever gotten up in the morning and felt its great to be alive? that every breath is a gift of sweet life from above? \\n\\nelaine: oh, and before i forget, i have the checks for the first month, last months security deposit. (laughs) i have seventy-five dollars left in my account. \\n\\njerry: well... theres a little bit of a problem. \\n\\nelaine: oh, i know. theres a weak shower spray, i know. ive already thought about it, and im switching to baths. as winston churchill said, why stand when you can sit? maybe ill get some rubber duckies. \\n\\njerry: uh, no uh, someone offered harold and manny five thousand for the apartment. im sure theyd just as soon give it to you, but youd have to come up with that money. \\n\\nelaine: five thousand dollars? i dont have five thousand dollars. \\n\\njerry: i know. \\n\\nelaine: (disappointed) how am i going to get five thousand dollars? \\n\\njerry: i have no idea. \\n\\nkramer: (to elaine) hey, my new neighbor! \\n\\nelaine: im not moving in. \\n\\nkramer: what? \\n\\nelaine: they want five thousand dollars now. \\n\\nkramer: so, okay uh whats the problem? \\n\\nelaine: i dont have five thousand dollars. \\n\\nkramer: cmon, you can come up with five thousand dollars.

(starts dancing) \\n\\njerry: i dont know. what do you do when a neighbor is making, like, a lot of noise at three oclock in the morning? i mean, can you knock on someones door and tell them to keep it down? youre really altering your whole self-image. i mean, what am i, fred mertz now? whats happening to me? can i do this? am i a shusher? i used to be a shushee. theres a lot of shushing going on in movie theaters. people are always shushing. shh... shh... shhh... shhh... doesnt work, cause nobody knows where a shush is coming from. they just hear a shh. was that a shush? i think somebody just shushed me. some people you cant shush in a movie theater. theres always that certain group of people, isnt it? theyre talking and talking, and everyone around them is shushing them, and shushing them. they wont shush. theyre the unshushables. \\n\\njerry: i have to tell you that i did some very exciting news recently, and i dont know if i should really tell you exactly what it is because its really not a definite thing yet. (crowd cheers him on to tell them) well, i will tell you what i know so far. according to the information that i have in the envelope that ive received, it seems that i may have already won some very valuable prizes. (audience applauds) well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. that\\'s very nice to hear that. but, in all honesty, i have to say, i didnt even know i was in this thing. but, according to the readout, it looks like i am among the top people that they are considering. you know, thats what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, you may have already won. id like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. send out envelopes, you have definitely lost! you turn it over, giant printing, not even close! you open it up, theres this whole letter of explanation, even we cannot believe how badly you have done in this contest. \\n\\njerry: (to kramer) to the right. \\n\\ngeorge: that took awhile. \\n\\njerry: dont get up. \\n\\ngeorge: id like to help, but my neck.. \\n\\ngeorge: so how long has it been in the basement? \\n\\njerry: since my grandfather died. i was suppose to send it down to my parents in florida, but they didnt want it. they told me to get rid of it, but i felt funny and then i sort of forgot about it. and its been sitting down there for three years until he saw it. (to kramer) all right, so, just take what you want and lets get it out of here. \\n\\ngeorge: whats in it? \\n\\njerry: grandpa clothes, i cant wear em. \\n\\nkramer: you want these? knee socks. you dont wear knee socks. \\n\\njerry: no, go ahead. look at this place. i cant wait to get it cleaned. \\n\\ngeorge: i know someone wholl do it. shes good. shes honest. \\n\\njerry: no, elaines got this writer friend from finland, rava. her boyfriend goes to columbia grad school, and hes suppose to do it. \\n\\ngeorge: students cant clean. its anathema. (explaining) they dont like it. \\n\\njerry: how long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation? \\n\\nkramer: now this i like. \\n\\ngeorge: wait a second. (george gets up and heads for the statue in kramers hands.) i cant believe this! let me see this. \\n\\nkramer: wait, wait, wait... \\n\\ngeorge: let me just see it. \\n\\nkramer: come on... \\n\\ngeorge: let me just see it for a second. \\n\\ngeorge: oh my god, its exactly the same! \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\ngeorge: when i was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue on the mantle of our apartment. exactly. and, one day, i grabbed it, and i was using it as a microphone. i was singing, macarthur park, and i got to the part about, ill never have that recipe again, and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. my parents looked at me like i smashed the ten commandments. to this day, they bring it up. it was the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father naked. \\n\\nkramer: cmon, george. i saw it first. \\n\\ngeorge: no, kramer. i have to have this statue. \\n\\nkramer: no, i got dibs! \\n\\ngeorge: what? no dibs! i need this statue. cmon, give it! \\n\\njerry: spread out, spread out you numbskulls. why dont you just settle it like mature adults? \\n\\nkramer: potato man! \\n\\ngeorge: no, no, no potato man. inka-dink. \\n\\nkramer: okay...yea well uh start with me. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, good, good. \\n\\njerry: inka-dink, a bottle of ink, the cork fell out, and you stink. \\n\\njerry: not because youre dirty, not because youre clean  just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine... \\n\\njerry: and you are it! \\n\\nkramer: what?! wait a minute. no, no, no. what are you doing? no, no, oh, oh, okay. hes out. i get it. \\n\\ngeorge: no, no, no, no, im it. i win. \\n\\njerry: no, hes it. he wins. it is good. \\n\\nkramer: do over  start with him. \\n\\njerry: no, no, no, come on, kramer. now, you got the socks. \\n\\nkramer: all right, you can have it.

(snapping fingers in tune with words) i drop it off. i pick it up. it\\'s a delight. \\n\\nkramer: how \\'bout if i put a few things -- \\n\\njerry: wait a sec. i don\\'t wanna do -- \\n\\nkramer: well, you\\'re going over there. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t wanna mix in everything! my guys don\\'t know your guys. you can\\'t just lock \\'em all in the same machine together. they\\'ll start a riot. \\n\\nkramer: have you ever met my guys? \\n\\njerry: no. i can\\'t say as i have. \\n\\nkramer: well! \\n\\njerry: all right. put \\'em on top. \\n\\nkramer: ah! \\n\\njerry: oh, beautiful. \\n\\njerry: this stuff on top is my friends. could i get it done in a separate machine? \\n\\nvic: i\\'ll have to charge you for another machine. \\n\\njerry: whatever it costs. in fact, i would prefer it if the machines are not even touching each other. because something could, you know, jump across. \\n\\ngeorge: guess what. \\n\\njerry: how did you know i was here? \\n\\ngeorge: kramer. guess what. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know. \\n\\ngeorge: i quit my job. \\n\\njerry: get outta here. \\n\\ngeorge: i couldn\\'t take it anymore. \\n\\nvic: you can have this on monday. (hands jerry a ticket) \\n\\njerry: what happened? levitan? \\n\\ngeorge: i go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, and then i get a memo - a memo - telling me to use the men\\'s room in the hall. well, (laughing) i mean we share it with pace electronics. it\\'s disgusting! \\n\\njerry: you and your toilets. \\n\\ngeorge: i snapped! it was the last straw. (sighs) \\n\\njerry: so, what are you gonna do now? are you gonna look for something else in real estate? \\n\\ngeorge: nobody\\'s hiring now. the market\\'s terrible. \\n\\njerry: so what are you gonna do? \\n\\ngeorge: i like sports. i could do something in sports. \\n\\njerry: uh-huh. uh-huh. in what capacity? \\n\\ngeorge: you know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something. \\n\\njerry: yeah. well, that - that could be tough to get. \\n\\ngeorge: well, it doesn\\'t even have to be the general manager. maybe i could be like, an announcer. like a color man. you know how i always make those interesting comments during the game. \\n\\njerry: yeah. yeah. you make good comments. \\n\\ngeorge: what about that? \\n\\njerry: well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that are, you know, in broadcasting. \\n\\ngeorge: well, that\\'s really not fair. \\n\\njerry: i know. well, okay. okay. what else do ya like? \\n\\ngeorge: movies. i like to watch movies. \\n\\njerry: yeah. yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: do they pay people to watch movies? \\n\\njerry: projectionists. \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s true. \\n\\njerry: but you gotta know how to work the projector. \\n\\ngeorge: right. \\n\\njerry: and it\\'s probably a union thing. \\n\\ngeorge: (scoffs) those unions. (sighs) okay. sports,...movies. what about a talk show host? \\n\\njerry: talk show host. that\\'s good. \\n\\ngeorge: i think i\\'d be good at that. i talk to people all the time. someone even told me once they thought i\\'d be a good talk show host. \\n\\njerry: really? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. a couple of people. i don\\'t get that, though. where do you start? \\n\\njerry: well, that\\'s where it gets tricky. \\n\\ngeorge: you can\\'t just walk into a building and say \" i wanna be a talk show host.\" \\n\\njerry: i wouldn\\'t think so. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s all politics. \\n\\njerry: all right. okay. sports, movies, talk show host. what else? \\n\\ngeorge: this could have been a huge mistake. \\n\\njerry: well, it doesn\\'t sound like you completely thought this through. \\n\\ngeorge: (sighs) guess not. what should i do? \\n\\njerry: maybe you can just go back. \\n\\ngeorge: go back? \\n\\njerry: yeah. pretend like it never happened. \\n\\ngeorge: you mean just walk into the staff meeting on monday morning like it never happened? \\n\\njerry: sure. you\\'re an emotional person. people don\\'t take you seriously. \\n\\ngeorge: just..go back. pretend the whole thing never happened. \\n\\njerry: never happened. \\n\\ngeorge: i was just blowin\\' off a little steam. so what? \\n\\njerry: so what? you\\'re entitled. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m emotional. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s right. you\\'re emotional. \\n\\ngeorge: never happened. \\n\\njerry: never happened. \\n\\njerry: to me the most annoying thing about the couple of times that i did work in an office. is that when you go in, in the morning you say hi to everyone and for some reason throughout the day you have to continue to greet these people all day every time you see them. i mean you walk in \"morning bill, morning bob, how you doing? fine\" ten minutes later you see him in the hall, \"how ya doin\\'?\" every time you pass you gotta come up with another little greeting. you know you start racking your brains you know you do the little eyebrow \"hey\" you start coming up with nicknames for them. \"jimbo.\" \\n\\ngeorge: how ya doin\\'? \\n\\nglenda: what are you doing here? \\n\\ngeorge: what? i work here. \\n\\nglenda: i thought you quit. \\n\\ngeorge: what quit? (laughing) who quit? \\n\\ndan: bill, how was your weekend? \\n\\nbill: oh, excellent weekend. what about your weekend? \\n\\ndan: fine weekend. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. good weekend. \\n\\ndan: went up to the cape. took the kids sailing. (laughing) lisa was a little scared at first, but that kids\\' gonna be a good sailor someday. \\n\\ngeorge: aw, she\\'s gonna be a fine sailor. \\n\\nlevitan: ava, what happened to you friday afternoon? \\n\\nava: oh, i got a little tied up. \\n\\nlevitan: i\\'ll bet you did. \\n\\nlevitan: i wanna remind everyone that the tenth anniversary party for rick barr properties is gonna be wednesday afternoon at four o\\'clock in lasky\\'s bar, on madison 48th. i want all of you to be there. this really means a lot to me. is that costanza over there? what are you doing here? \\n\\ngeorge: what? \\n\\nlevitan: am i crazy, or didn\\'t you quit? \\n\\ngeorge: when? \\n\\nlevitan: friday. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, what? what? that? are you kidding? i didn\\'t quit. what? you took that seriously? \\n\\nlevitan: you mean, laughingstock? all that stuff? \\n\\ngeorge: come on. will you stop it. \\n\\nlevitan: no brains? no ability? \\n\\ngeorge: teasing. \\n\\nlevitan: okay. i want you outta here. \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t know where you\\'re getting this from. i....you\\'re serious aren\\'t you? oh, (laughing) you see? you see, you just don\\'t know my sense of humor. dan, don\\'t i joke around all the time? \\n\\ndan: i wouldn\\'t say all the time. \\n\\nlevitan: you can\\'t win. you can\\'t beat me. that\\'s why i\\'m here and you\\'re there. because i\\'m a winner. i\\'ll always be a winner and you\\'ll always be a loser. \\n\\ngeorge: \" i\\'ll always be a winner and you\\'ll always be a loser.\" this is what he said to me. \\n\\njerry: well, so that\\'s that. \\n\\ngeorge: no. that\\'s not that. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s not that? \\n\\ngeorge: no. \\n\\njerry: well, if that\\'s not that, what is that? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'ve got some plans. i got plans. \\n\\njerry: what kind of plans? \\n\\ngeorge: what\\'s the difference? \\n\\njerry: you don\\'t wanna tell me? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m gonna slip him a mickey. \\n\\njerry: what? in his drink? are you outta your mind? what are you peter lorre? \\n\\ngeorge: you don\\'t understand. he\\'s got this big party coming up. he\\'s been looking forward to this for months. this is gonna destroy the whole thing. \\n\\njerry: what if you destroy him? \\n\\ngeorge: no. no. no. no. no. don\\'t worry. it\\'s perfectly safe. i researched it. he\\'ll get a little woozy. he might keel over. \\n\\njerry: well, wha - what does that do? big deal. \\n\\ngeorge: this is what they would do in the movies! it\\'s a beautiful thing! it\\'s like a movie! i\\'m gonna slip him a mickey! \\n\\njerry: you\\'ve really gone mental. \\n\\ngeorge: nah. \\n\\njerry: where are you gonna get this mickey? i can\\'t believe i\\'m saying \"mickey\"! \\n\\ngeorge: i got a source. \\n\\njerry: you got a mickey source? \\n\\ngeorge: and elaine is gonna keep him busy. \\n\\njerry: elaine? how did you rope her into this? \\n\\ngeorge: i told her what a sexist he is. how he cheats on his wife. \\n\\njerry: she knew that. \\n\\ngeorge: but she didn\\'t know he doesn\\'t recycle. \\n\\njerry: what is the point of all this? \\n\\ngeorge: revenge. \\n\\njerry: oh, the best revenge is living well. \\n\\ngeorge: there\\'s no chance of that. \\n\\njerry: did you get your laundry? \\n\\nkramer: yeah. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s with you? \\n\\nkramer: he jumped. \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nkramer: yeah. newman jumped. \\n\\njerry: did he call you last night? \\n\\nkramer: oh, yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. \\n\\njerry: what did you say? \\n\\nkramer: i said \" wave to me when you pass my window.\" \\n\\njerry: whew. did he wave? \\n\\nkramer: no! he jumped from the second floor. mr. papanickolous saw him from across the street. he\\'s lying out there faking. see, he\\'s trying to get back at me. \\n\\njerry: (realizing something) oh, my god! \\n\\nkramer: what\\'s the matter? \\n\\njerry: (tearing through his laundry bag) well, on thursday when i came home i had $1500 on me. for some reason i decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then i completely forgot about it...and then i took the laundry in on friday! oh, come on, let\\'s go. \\n\\nkramer: where? where? \\n\\njerry: to the laundromat. \\n\\nvic: i never saw it. \\n\\nkramer: okay. come on. give the guy his money. what -- what are you doing? \\n\\nvic: hey, you see that sign right there?

(levitan takes a drink) \\n\\ngeorge: i like history. civil war. maybe i could be a professor, or something. \\n\\nelaine: well, to teach something you really have to know a lot about it. i think you need a degree. \\n\\njerry: yeah. that\\'s true. \\n\\nkramer: (seeing jerry is with people) oh. \\n\\njerry: what? (kramer hands jerry an envelope) my god, the money! the 1500! where\\'d you find it? \\n\\nkramer: it was in my laundry. \\n\\njerry: in your laundry the whole time? i told you not to mix in our guys. what did we figure the damage on that machine would be? \\n\\nkramer: it was about 1200 bucks. \\n\\nnewman: kramer! \\n\\nkramer: oh! that\\'s newman.

(studies the note) \\n\\nelaine: hey, where\\'s kramer? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know. that\\'s like asking \"where\\'s waldo?\" \\n\\ngeorge: (still holding the note) i think i\\'m having a heart attack. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t think that\\'s it. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m not kidding. \\n\\njerry: what does that mean? \\n\\nelaine: i think what he\\'s trying to say is that he\\'s having a heart attack. \\n\\njerry: oh, he\\'s having a heart attack. \\n\\ngeorge: tightness.. \\n\\njerry: c\\'mon. \\n\\ngeorge: shortness of breath.. \\n\\njerry: oh, this is ridiculous. \\n\\ngeorge: radiating waves of pain.. \\n\\njerry: i know what this is. you saw that show on pbs last night, coronary country. (to elaine) i saw it in the tv guide. i called him and told him to make sure and not watch it. \\n\\ngeorge: there was nothing else on. oh, the left arm.. the left arm. \\n\\njerry: (to elaine) he saw that show on anorexia last year, and ate like an animal for two weeks. \\n\\ngeorge: why can\\'t i have a heart attack? i\\'m allowed. \\n\\njerry: so what do you want? you want me take you to the hospital? \\n\\ngeorge: manhattan memorial, less of a line. \\n\\njerry: i\\'ll call an ambulance. (exits) \\n\\nwaitress: is everything alright? \\n\\ngeorge: we\\'ll just take a check. (she leaves the check. george, in all his cheapness, can\\'t help but to review the check. he finds an error) you made a mistake on the.. \\n\\nelaine: george! \\n\\n[setting: hospital room] \\n\\nman: ooohhh... argghhh.. \\n\\ngeorge: are.. are you okay? \\n\\nman: ooooooohhh.. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m george.. george costanza.. i\\'ve never been in the hospital a day in my life.. except when i had my tonsils out. you know, they never gave me any ice cream. i always felt that- \\n\\nman: shut up! \\n\\njerry: well? what do you think? \\n\\nnurse 1: \"salami, salami, bologna.\" definitely. \\n\\njerry: \"salami salami bologna\"? \\n\\ndoctor: (in a hurry) oh, your friend\\'s fine. he didn\\'t have a heart attack. i\\'ll be in - in a few minutes. \\n\\njerry: (sarcastic) what a surprise. (enters george\\'s room overly sympathetic - leading george to think that the doctor told jerry something significant) hey, how ya doin\\' buddy? you need anything? do you want me to go out and get you a superman comic? \\n\\ngeorge: no, no thanks. \\n\\njerry: (still going along with the practical joke) you know, i was wondering.. you know that black hawks jacket you have? \\n\\ngeorge: oh, sure, my black hawks jacket. i love my black hawks jacket. \\n\\njerry: well, you know, i was thinking - if things don\\'t exactly work out.. \\n\\ngeorge: well, it wouldn\\'t fit you. the sleeves are too short. \\n\\njerry: no, i tried it on. it fits good. \\n\\ngeorge: well, i didn\\'t really think about what i was gonna do with all.. \\n\\njerry: well, you know.. \\n\\ngeorge: (reluctantly) well, okay. \\n\\njerry: oh, and.. do you think it would be alright if i called susan davis? \\n\\ngeorge: susan davis? (getting possessive) hey, wait a second.. \\n\\njerry: well, it\\'s not like we\\'d be bumping into you. \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t know.. you and susan davis? \\n\\njerry: you know, if your future was a little more certain.. \\n\\ngeorge: okay, go ahead. call her, get married, have babies, have a great life.. what do i care? i\\'m finished. (really depressed) it\\'s all over for me. in fact, let\\'s end it right now. jerry, kill me, kill me now. i\\'m begging you. let\\'s just get it over with. be a pal.. just take the pillow and put it over my face. \\n\\njerry: well, ah.. (takes his pillow) what? kind of like this? (violently smothers george with the pillow. george freaks out. he didn\\'t think jerry would actually do it) \\n\\ngeorge: what are ya doing?! whadya, crazy?! \\n\\nelaine: jerry! \\n\\njerry: (acts like he was cought red-handed) elaine, what are you doing here? (takes the pillow off george, and puts it back on his bed) \\n\\ngeorge: (to jerry) jerk off. \\n\\njerry: (whispering) there\\'s nothing wrong with him. i saw the doctor. he\\'s fine. \\n\\nelaine: hi, george. how ya feeling? is anybody getting your apartment? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'ll tell ya, if i ever get out of here, i\\'m gonna change my life. i\\'m gonna do a whole zen thing. take up yoga, meditate.. i\\'ll eat right. calm down, lose my anger.. (sees jerry and elaine aren\\'t listening. he snaps) hey, is anybody listening?! \\n\\ndoctor: (to elaine) uh, hello. (to george) uh, mr. costanza? \\n\\ngeorge: (panicky) uh, yeah. you know, doctor, i gotta tell you, i feel a lot better. \\n\\ndoctor: well, we looked at your ekg\\'s, ran some tests, did a complete work-up. \\n\\ngeorge: (getting in a more panicked state) oh god, mommy! \\n\\ndoctor: and you simply haven\\'t had a heart attack. \\n\\ngeorge: (relieved) i haven\\'t? i\\'m okay? i\\'m okay? oh, thank you, thank you, doctor! i don\\'t know how to thank you. \\n\\njerry: (sarcastic) hey, that was really fun, george. can we go home now? \\n\\ndoctor: no, actually, we\\'d like to keep him here overnight for observation, just to be safe. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, sure. sure, anything. can you believe it? there\\'s nothing wrong with me. \\n\\ndoctor: well, i wouldn\\'t go that far. \\n\\ngeorge: (starting to panic again) what? oh my god. what? is it meningitis? scoliosis? lupis?! is it lupis?! \\n\\ndoctor: have you ever had your tonsils taken out? \\n\\ngeorge: my tonsils? yeah, when i was a kid. \\n\\ndoctor: well, they\\'ve grown back. your adenoids are swollen too. \\n\\ngeorge: really? \\n\\nelaine: (jokingly hits the doctor) whose tonsils grow back? (laughs) \\n\\ndoctor: it happens. \\n\\njerry: yeah, if you\\'ve been exposed to gamma rays. \\n\\nelaine: i still have my tonsils. everyone in my family has their tonsils. in fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didn\\'t have their tonsils. \\n\\ndoctor: that\\'s interesting. because, no one in my family has their tonsils, and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people. \\n\\njerry: (sarcastically) well, it\\'s like the capulets and the montagues. \\n\\ngeorge: (drawing attention back to him) excuse me! \\n\\ndoctor: anyway, i strongly recommend they come out. \\n\\ngeorge: what? you mean with a knife? \\n\\ndoctor: yes. with a knife. you know, snip, snip. anyway, you\\'d be completely under, you wouldn\\'t feel a thing. and when you wake up, you can have some ice cream. \\n\\ngeorge: (angry) yeah, that\\'s what they told me the last time. \\n\\ndoctor: think about it. (turns to leave, but runs into elaine) excuse me. \\n\\nelaine: (flustered) oh, i\\'m sorry. (doctor exits) i just.. have to ask that doctor one more question. (leaves) \\n\\njerry: women go after doctors like men go after models. they want someone with knowledge of the body.. we just want the body. \\n\\nkramer: hey. \\n\\njerry: hey. \\n\\nkramer: boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs. hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. it\\'s like a sizzler\\'s opened up a hospital! (sits and starts eating) so, how did you have a heart attack? you\\'re a young man. what were you doing? are they gonna do a zipper job? oh, they love to do zipper jobs. \\n\\njerry: (trying to shut him up) kramer. \\n\\nkramer: the really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing. see, you gotta be careful about sex now. you get that heart pumping and suddenly, boom! next thing you know, you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage. \\n\\njerry: kramer, george didn\\'t have a heart attack. \\n\\nkramer: no? that\\'s good. \\n\\ngeorge: i have to have my tonsils taken out. \\n\\nkramer: oh man.. no.. george, we gotta get you outta here. get out! right now! they\\'ll kill ya in here. \\n\\njerry: (trying to calm george down) it\\'s routine surgery. \\n\\nkramer: oh yeah? my friend, bob saccomanno, he came in here for a hernia operation.. oh yeah, routine surgery.. now he\\'s sittin\\' around in a chair by a window going, \"my name is bob\" .. george, whatever you do, don\\'t let \\'em cut you. don\\'t let \\'em cut you.. \\n\\ngeorge: well, what should i do, kramer? \\n\\njerry: well, for one think, don\\'t listen to him. \\n\\nkramer: i\\'ll tell you what to do, i\\'ll tell you what to do. you go to tor eckman. tor, tor, he\\'ll fix you right up. he\\'s a herbalist, a healer, george. he\\'s not just gonna fix the tonsils and the adenoids, he is gonna change the whole way you function - body and mind. \\n\\njerry: eckman? i thought he was doing time? \\n\\nkramer: no, no, he\\'s out. he got out. see, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame him. it\\'s all politics. but he\\'s a rebel. \\n\\njerry: a rebel? no. johnny yuma was a rebel. eckman is a nut. george, you want to take care of your tonsils, you do it in a hospital. with a doctor. \\n\\nkramer: he\\'s holistic, george. he\\'s holistic. \\n\\ngeorge: holistic.. that sounds right. \\n\\njerry: george, you need a medical doctor. \\n\\ngeorge: (to jerry) let me ask you something.. how much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital? \\n\\njerry: well, an overnight stay in a hospital? minor surgery? i dunno, four grand. \\n\\ngeorge: uh-huh. and how much does the healer charge? \\n\\nkramer: first visit? thirty-eight bucks. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, yeah? holistic.. that\\'s what i need. that\\'s the answer. \\n\\n[setting: healer\\'s apartment] \\n\\ngeorge: so, how do you like the way i talked you into comin\\' down here? \\n\\njerry: don\\'t flatter yourself, my friend. i\\'m here strictly for material, and i have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. i still think you\\'re nuts, though. \\n\\ngeorge: all i know is i\\'ve been going to doctors all my life. what has it gotten me? i\\'m thirty-three years old. i haven\\'t outgrown the problems of puberty, i\\'m already facing the problems of old age. i completely skipped healthy adulthood. i went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. you could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. i\\'ve never had a normal, medium orgasm. \\n\\njerry: (jokingly making fun of george) i\\'ve never had a really good pickle. \\n\\ngeorge: besides, what\\'s it gonna cost me? thirty-eight bucks? \\n\\ntor: (to jerry) would you not put your foot on that please? \\n\\njerry: sorry. \\n\\ntor: what month were you born? \\n\\ngeorge: april. \\n\\ntor: you should have been born in august. your parents would have been well-advised to wait. \\n\\ngeorge: really? \\n\\ntor: do you use hot water in the shower? \\n\\ngeorge: yes. \\n\\ntor: stop using it. \\n\\ngeorge: ..okay. \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m off hot water. \\n\\ntor: kramer tells me that you are interested in an alternative to surgery. \\n\\ngeorge: yes, yes i am. \\n\\ntor: (blows into george\\'s face) i think we can help you. see, unfortunately, the medical establishment is a business like any other business. and business needs customers. and, they want to sell you their most expensive item which is unnecessary surgery. \\n\\ngeorge: (still on the showers) can i use hot water on my face? \\n\\ntor: no. you know, i am not a business man. i\\'m a holistic healer. it\\'s a calling, it\\'s a gift. you see, it\\'s in the best interest of the medical profession that you remain sick. you see, that insures good business. you\\'re not a patient. you\\'re a customer. \\n\\njerry: (he thinks this, the audience can hear his thoughts) and you\\'re not a doctor, but you play one in real life. \\n\\ngeorge: (still on the hot water) what about shaving? \\n\\ntor: (to jerry) you\\'re eating too much dairy. (to george) may i? (reaches over, and touches george\\'s face) \\n\\ngeorge: i guess so. \\n\\ntor: (feeling george\\'s face) you see, you are in disharmony. the throat is the gateway to the lung. tonsillitis, adenoiditis, is, in chinese medical terms, and invasion of heat and wind. \\n\\njerry: (again, we hear his thoughts) there\\'s some hot air blowing in here.. \\n\\ntor: you know, i lived with the eskimos many years ago, and they used to plunge their faces into the snow. \\n\\ngeorge: (once again, still on the shower) could it be lukewarm? \\n\\njerry: too much dairy? you really think i\\'m eating too much dairy? \\n\\n[setting: doctor\\'s car] \\n\\ndoctor: ..the tongue.. yes, the tongue.. or, in medical terms, the glossa. it\\'s a muscular organ.. consists of two parts.. the body, and the root.. you see, it\\'s covered by this mucous membrane.. these little raised projections are the papillae, which give it that furry appearance. very tactile.. \\n\\nelaine: uh-huh. \\n\\n[setting: healer\\'s apartment] \\n\\ntor: (pouring tea) your tea is ready now. this will solve your so-called tonsil problem. it\\'s a special concoction. it contains crampbark. \\n\\njerry: i love crampbark. \\n\\ntor: cleavers. \\n\\njerry: cleaver, i once had cleaver as a kid. i was able to lift a car. \\n\\ntor: and some couchgrass. \\n\\njerry: couchgrass and crampbark? you know, i think that\\'s what killed curly. \\n\\nkramer: go ahead, drink it, george. \\n\\njerry: excuse me, tor. may i ask you a question? you have intuitive abilities. you\\'re in touch with a lot of this cosmic kind of things.. i have this note i can\\'t read. i was wondering if- \\n\\ntor: (takes the note, then laughs when he reads it) oh, yes.. yes.. \"cleveland 117, san antonio 109.. (hands note back to jerry) \\n\\nkramer: go ahead, drink it, george. \\n\\ngeorge: (takes a sip) hey, it\\'s not too bad.. \\n\\n[setting: ambulance] \\n\\ngeorge: (in a state of hysteria) i\\'m an eggplant! i\\'m an eggplant! i\\'m a minstrel man! \\n\\ndriver: (to assistant) i didn\\'t take your chuckle, man! \\n\\nassistant: i had five chuckles. i ate a green one, and the yellow one, and the red one is missing! \\n\\ndriver: i don\\'t even like chuckles! \\n\\njerry: (to assistant) maybe he doesn\\'t like them. that\\'s possible. \\n\\ngeorge: my face! my face! get me to the hospital! \\n\\nassistant: i want that chuckle! you hear me?! \\n\\njerry: (to assistant) i\\'ll get you a chuckle. you want me to get you a chuckle? \\n\\nassistant: (angry, to driver) pull over! \\n\\ndriver: pull over? did you say pull over?! you want a piece of me?! \\n\\nassistant: yeah! \\n\\njerry: you\\'re gonna fight? \\n\\ngeorge: now?! i\\'m a mutant! \\n\\nkramer: (to driver) hey, let me drive. \\n\\nassistant: come on, man. pull over! \\n\\ndriver: alright! i\\'m gonna mess you up, man! \\n\\njerry: (pleading) really, gentlemen, please. \\n\\ngeorge: my heart! my heart! (to assistant) where you going? are you crazy?! \\n\\nassistant: i\\'m gonna kick his ass. \\n\\nkramer: (to assistant) hey, you have keys? \\n\\ngeorge: you can\\'t leave! this is an ambulance! this is an emergency! \\n\\njerry: all this for a chuckle. \\n\\nkramer: what\\'s a chuckle? \\n\\njerry: it\\'s a jelly candy. it comes in five flavors. \\n\\n[setting: doctor\\'s car] \\n\\ndoctor: you see, taste buds run on grooves along the surfaces. \\n\\nelaine: can you let go of my tongue now? \\n\\ndoctor: what? \\n\\nelaine: let go of my tongue! \\n\\ndoctor: (lets go) oh, sorry. \\n\\nelaine: well, i should get going.. (the doctor leans in for a kiss. elaine stops him) what are you doing? \\n\\ndoctor: i was going to kiss you good night. \\n\\nelaine: a kiss? with the tongue? the glossa with the bumps and the papillae? ..yech, i don\\'t think so. (leaves) \\n\\n[setting: ambulance] \\n\\njerry: you just can\\'t leave him out there. \\n\\ndriver: i told him i was gonna mess him up. \\n\\nkramer: well, can you call him an ambulance? \\n\\ndriver: i told him i didn\\'t take his chuckle. i don\\'t eat that gooey crap! \\n\\nkramer: hey, watch the road! watch the road, man! \\n\\ndriver: (turns back, facing kramer) hey, man, you want some of what he got?! \\n\\njerry and kramer: watch out! \\n\\n[setting: hospital room] \\n\\njerry: how ya doing? (george nods) can\\'t talk? (george shakes his head. jerry gestures to his brace) hey, how\\'d you get the plastic one? (george raises his eyebrows) i like that. (george sticks his tongue out) so how\\'s life without tonsils? (george quickly indicates with his arm that he wants ice cream) what? what\\'s that? ..so, how much is this thing gonna cost you now? like, five, six thousand?.. (george signals that it\\'s more) well, live and learn.. at least we lived. kramer went to eckman.. he feels better alreadyy.. (george motions for ice cream again) what are you doing? \\n\\nelaine: oh, poor george. oh, i\\'m sorry, but i can\\'t stay long. i don\\'t want to run into doctor tongue.. here, i brought you something. (takes out a pint of ice cream. george gets excited) oh, please, come on.. it was nothing. \\n\\njerry: hey, check the tv. \\n\\ntv voice: (germanic) it\\'s just as you prophesied. the planets of our solar system, incinerating. like flaming globes, sigmond. like flaming globes. ah, ha, ha, ha.. \\n\\njerry: (pulls the note out of his pocket) that\\'s it! that\\'s it! flaming globes of sigmond! flaming globes of sigmond! that\\'s my note! tha\\'ts what i thought was so funny?! ..that\\'s not funny.. there\\'s nothing funny about that. \\n\\nman in neighboring bed: shut up! \\n\\nman: aaahhhgggg! \\n\\n[setting: night club] \\n\\njerry: i have a friend who\\'s a hypochondriac, always thinks he\\'s sick - never is. and they, you have another type of person, always thinks they\\'re well, not matter how bad they really are. you know this type of person? very annoying. \"feel great.. like being on the respirator.. intravenous heart/lung machine. i never felt better in my life.\" medical science is making advances every day in control health problems. in fact, it\\'s probably only a matter of time before a heart attack, you know, becomes like, a head ache. we\\'ll just see people on tv going, \"i had a heart attack this big (holds out hands, gesturing bigness) ..but, i gave myself one of these. clear! (puts imaginary electrode panels to his chest) brrhht.. and it\\'s gone!\" \\n\\njerry: what are you doing? all right, all right. what\\'s the matter with that? what about that one? \\n\\nelaine: robert vaughn, the helsinki formula? \\n\\njerry: he was good in man from uncle. \\n\\nelaine: guess whose birthday\\'s comin\\' up soon? \\n\\njerry: i know, i\\'m having my root canal the same week. \\n\\nelaine: oh, right. i hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious. (changes channel) hey, look at naked people. \\n\\njerry: no, i don\\'t wanna see the naked people. \\n\\nelaine: been a while? \\n\\njerry: i have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago. \\n\\nelaine: i think my last time was in rochester. my hair was a lot shorter. \\n\\njerry: i remember that it\\'s a good thing. someday, i hope to do it again. (jerry looks at elaine) \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nelaine: what was that look? \\n\\njerry: what look? \\n\\nelaine: the look you just gave me. \\n\\njerry: i gave a look? \\n\\nelaine: yes. \\n\\njerry: what kind of look? \\n\\nelaine: i know that look. \\n\\njerry: then what was it? \\n\\nelaine: why should i tell you? \\n\\njerry: well, you\\'re the big look expert. i wanna see how smart you are. \\n\\nelaine: trust me. i know the look. (pause) so... \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nelaine: what about the look? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know. \\n\\nelaine: you got something on your mind? \\n\\njerry: no. things pop into your head. you? \\n\\nelaine: things occur to me from time to time. \\n\\njerry: yeah, me too. well, you can\\'t expect to just forget the past completely. \\n\\nelaine: no, of course not. \\n\\njerry: i mean, it was something we did. probably about, what? twenty-five times? \\n\\nelaine: thirty-seven. \\n\\njerry: yeah, we pretty much know what we\\'re doin\\' in there. (points to bedroom) \\n\\nelaine: we know the terrain. \\n\\njerry: no big surprises. \\n\\nelaine: nope. \\n\\njerry: what do you think? \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t know. what do you think? \\n\\njerry: well, it\\'s something to consider. \\n\\nelaine: yeah. \\n\\njerry: i mean, let\\'s say we did. \\n\\nelaine: what if. \\n\\njerry: is that like the end of the world or something? \\n\\nelaine: certainly not. \\n\\njerry: why shouldn\\'t we be able to do that once in a while if we want to? \\n\\nelaine: i know. \\n\\njerry: i mean, really, what is the big deal? we go in there. (points to the bedroom) we\\'re in there for a while. we come right back out here. it\\'s not complicated. \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s almost stupid if we didn\\'t. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s moronic. \\n\\nelaine: absurd! \\n\\njerry: of course, i guess, maybe, some little problems could arise. \\n\\nelaine: we, there are always a few. \\n\\njerry: i mean, if anything happened, and we couldn\\'t be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad. \\n\\nelaine: devastating. \\n\\njerry: because this is very good. (points back and forth between them to indicate friendship) \\n\\nelaine: and that would be good. (points to bedroom) \\n\\njerry: that would be good too. the idea is combine the this and the that. but this cannot be disturbed. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, we just wanna take this and add that. \\n\\njerry: but of course, we\\'d have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. maybe some rules or something. \\n\\nelaine: huh. \\n\\njerry: for example, now, i call you whenever i\\'m inclined and vice versa. \\n\\nelaine: right. \\n\\njerry: but if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call. \\n\\nelaine: well why should that be? oh, i have an idea. i have an idea. no call the day after that. \\n\\njerry: beautiful. let\\'s make it a rule. \\n\\nelaine: all right, sir. \\n\\njerry: now here\\'s another little rule. \\n\\nelaine: yeah. \\n\\njerry: when we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. but sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. when that is not really sleep. sleep is separate from that. and i don\\'t see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that. \\n\\nelaine: okay, okay. rule number two. spending the night is optional! \\n\\njerry: well now we\\'re gettin\\' somewhere. \\n\\nelaine: what about the kiss goodnight? \\n\\njerry: tough one. you\\'re call. \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s brug-wa (?). \\n\\njerry: fine. well. \\n\\nelaine: well. \\n\\njerry: you ready? \\n\\nelaine: ready. \\n\\njerry: so think you can handle this? \\n\\nelaine: definitely. (runs into bookshelf) \\n\\nkramer: hey. \\n\\njerry: hey. \\n\\nkramer: got the paper? \\n\\njerry: not yet. \\n\\nkramer: no paper? \\n\\njerry: i haven\\'t been out yet. \\n\\nkramer: well, what\\'s taking you so long? (elaine enters from the bedroom. kramer is a little shocked) uh? oh, well, yeah... (he exits) \\n\\ngeorge: what\\'s the deal with aquaman? could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water? \\n\\njerry: no, i think i saw him on land a couple times. so how\\'s the job situation goin\\'? \\n\\ngeorge: still lookin\\'. it\\'s pretty bad out there. what about you? \\n\\njerry: nothin\\' much. i slept with elaine last night. \\n\\ngeorge: oxygen! i need some oxygen! this is major. \\n\\njerry: i thought you\\'d like that. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, this is huge! \\n\\njerry: i know. \\n\\ngeorge: all right, okay. let\\'s go, details. \\n\\njerry: no, i can\\'t do details. \\n\\ngeorge: you wha? \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t give details. \\n\\ngeorge: no details? \\n\\njerry: i\\'m not in the mood. \\n\\ngeorge: you ask me here to have lunch, tell me you slept with elaine, and then say you\\'re not in the mood for details. now you listen to me. i want details and i want them right now. i don\\'t have a job, i have no place to go. you\\'re not in the mood? well you get in the mood! \\n\\njerry: all right, okay. we\\'re in the apartment watching tv. \\n\\ngeorge: where are you sitting? \\n\\njerry: on the couch. \\n\\ngeorge: next to each other? \\n\\njerry: no, separated. \\n\\ngeorge: time? \\n\\njerry: around eleven. \\n\\ngeorge: okay, go ahead. \\n\\njerry: so she\\'s flipping around the tv, and she gets to the naked station. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, see? that\\'s why i don\\'t have cable in my house. because of that naked station. if i had that in my house, i would never turn it off. i wouldn\\'t sleep, i wouldn\\'t eat. eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they\\'d find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. all right, all right. so you\\'re watching the naked station. \\n\\njerry: and then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex. \\n\\ngeorge: boy, these are really bad details. \\n\\njerry: it pains me to say this, but i may be getting to mature for details. \\n\\ngeorge: oh i hate to hear this. that kind of growth really irritates me. \\n\\njerry: well. i\\'ll tell you though. it was really passionate. \\n\\ngeorge: better than before? \\n\\njerry: she must\\'ve taken some kind of seminar or something. \\n\\ngeorge: this is all too much. so what are you feeling? what\\'s going on? are you like a couple again now? \\n\\njerry: not exactly. \\n\\ngeorge: not exactly. what does that mean? \\n\\njerry: well, we\\'ve tried to arrange a situation where we\\'ll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends. (george laughs hysterically and stands out of his seat) \\n\\ngeorge: where are you living? are you here? are you on this planet? it\\'s impossible. it can\\'t be done. \\n\\njerry: i think we\\'ve worked out a system. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, you know what you\\'re like? you\\'re like a pathetic gambler. you\\'re one of those losers in las vegas who keeps thinking he\\'s gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack. \\n\\njerry: no, this is very advanced. we\\'ve designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by avoiding all of the relationship pitfalls. \\n\\ngeorge: sure, all right. tell me the rules. \\n\\njerry: okay. no calls the next day. \\n\\ngeorge: (to himself) so you\\'re havin\\' the sex, next day you don\\'t have to call. that\\'s pretty good. (back to jerry) go ahead. \\n\\njerry: you ready for the second one? \\n\\ngeorge: i have tell you, i\\'m pretty impressed with the first one. \\n\\njerry: spending the night. optional. \\n\\ngeorge: no, you see? you got greedy. \\n\\njerry: no, that\\'s the rule. it\\'s optional. \\n\\ngeorge: i know less about women than anyone in the world. but one thing i do know is they\\'re not happy if you don\\'t spend the night. it could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide (displays with french fry) you\\'re not going anywhere. \\n\\njerry: i think you\\'re wrong. \\n\\ngeorge: i hope i am. \\n\\njerry: is this yours or the roommate\\'s? \\n\\nelaine: the roommate\\'s. \\n\\njerry: would she mind? \\n\\nelaine: she keeps track of everything. \\n\\njerry: well, that\\'s too bad, \\'cause i\\'m takin\\' it. \\n\\nelaine: thanks. \\n\\njerry: well, guess i\\'ll get going. \\n\\nelaine: oh. \\n\\njerry: well, i got that root canal tomorrow morning. it\\'ll be easier if i go home. \\n\\nelaine: fine, go away. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t understand. is there a problem? (elaine is pulling a roll of paper towels about twenty feet long) i\\'m getting the impression there\\'s a problem. \\n\\nelaine: just go. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m having surgery tomorrow. \\n\\nelaine: oh, surgery. you\\'re going to the dentist. \\n\\njerry: but you said, it can be very serious. \\n\\nelaine: okay, so fine. go. \\n\\njerry: what happened to the rules? remember? sleeping over was optional. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, it\\'s my house, it\\'s my option. \\n\\njerry: it has nothing to do with whose house it is. \\n\\nelaine: oh, of course it does. (elaine\\'s roommate, tina, enters) \\n\\ntina: hi. \\n\\nelaine + jerry: hi. \\n\\ntina: hi, jerry. \\n\\njerry: hi. \\n\\ntina: such a great improv class tonight. \\n\\nelaine: oh really? \\n\\ntina: i had this improv where i pretended i was working in one of those booths. you know, in the amusement park, where you have to shoot the water in the clown\\'s mouth and you have to blow up the balloon. \\n\\nelaine: uh, tina? could you excuse us for just one second? \\n\\ntina: oh, yeah. i\\'ll excuse you. (she walks away) \\n\\nelaine: what are you doing? \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t go if you\\'re mad. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m not mad. \\n\\njerry: you seemed a little mad. \\n\\nelaine: no, no. jerry, i\\'m fine really. it\\'s okay. \\n\\njerry: so you\\'re okay with everything? \\n\\nelaine: definitely. are you? \\n\\njerry: definitely. well, goodnight. \\n\\nelaine: goodn-- (he starts to kiss her) what\\'re you doing? \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nelaine: rules. \\n\\ntina: hey, who took my cake? (jerry exits quickly) \\n\\ngeorge: what about jewelry? that\\'s very nice gift. \\n\\njerry: no, no. i have to be very careful here. i don\\'t want to send the wrong message. especially after the other night. \\n\\ngeorge: maybe i\\'ll get her some jewelry. \\n\\njerry: no, no. you can\\'t get her anything better than me. whatever i spend, you have to spend half. \\n\\ngeorge: what am i supposed to get, a bazooka? \\n\\njerry: you don\\'t understand. i\\'m in a very delicate position. whatever i give her, she\\'s going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it. \\n\\ngeorge: what does she need? maybe there\\'s something that she needs. \\n\\njerry: i think i heard her say something about a bench. \\n\\ngeorge: a bench? what kind of a bench? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know, but she mentioned a bench. \\n\\ngeorge: what, like at a bus stop? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know. \\n\\ngeorge: like a park bench? \\n\\njerry: i have no idea. \\n\\ngeorge: who puts a bench in their house? \\n\\njerry: forget the bench. \\n\\ngeorge: i got it. you wanna get her something nice? how \\'bout a music box? \\n\\njerry: no, too relationshippy. she opens it up, she hears that laura\\'s theme, i\\'m dead. \\n\\ngeorge: okay, what about a nice frame? with a picture of another guy in it. frame says i care for you, but if you wanna get serious, perhaps you\\'d be interested in someone like this. \\n\\njerry: nice looking fellow. \\n\\ngeorge: what about candle holders? \\n\\njerry: too romantic. \\n\\ngeorge: lingerie? \\n\\njerry: too sexual. \\n\\ngeorge: waffle maker. \\n\\njerry: too domestic. \\n\\ngeorge: bust of nelson rockefeller. \\n\\njerry: too gubernatorial. (?) \\n\\ngeorge: let\\'s work on the card. \\n\\njerry: maybe you won\\'t like it. \\n\\nelaine: oh, how could i not like it? of course i\\'ll like it. \\n\\njerry: you could not like it. \\n\\nelaine: just the fact that you remembered means everything. \\n\\njerry: of course i remembered. you reminded me everyday for two months. oh, the card. (she opens) \\n\\nelaine: cash? \\n\\njerry: would do you think? \\n\\nelaine: you got me cash? \\n\\njerry: well this way i figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want. no good? \\n\\nelaine: who are you, my uncle? \\n\\njerry: well come on. that\\'s $182 right there. i don\\'t think that\\'s anything to sneeze at. \\n\\nelaine: let me see the card. (reading) to a wonderful girl, a great pal, and more? (kramer enters) \\n\\nkramer: hey. oh, elaine. i\\'m glad you\\'re here. stay right there. i\\'m gonna be right back. (he exits) \\n\\nelaine: pal? you think i\\'m your pal? \\n\\njerry: i said, \"and more.\" \\n\\nelaine: i am not your pal. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s wrong with pal? why is everyone so down on pal? (kramer enters with present) \\n\\nelaine: oh, what is this? you got me something? \\n\\nkramer: yeah. open it. \\n\\nelaine: oh kramer... (she opens it) the bench! you got me the bench that i wanted! (jerry looks irritated) \\n\\nkramer: that\\'s pretty good, huh? \\n\\njerry: great. \\n\\nkramer: remember when we were standing there and she mentioned it? i made a mental note of it. \\n\\njerry: well goody for you. \\n\\nkramer: oh yeah, i\\'m very sensitive about that. i mean, when someone\\'s birthday comes up, i keep my ears open. so what\\'d you get her? \\n\\njerry: 182 bucks. \\n\\nkramer: cash? you gotta be kidding. what kind of gift is that? that\\'s like something her uncle would get her. \\n\\nelaine: (reading card) think where man\\'s glory most begins and ends and say my glory was i had such a friend. \\n\\nkramer: (to jerry) yates. \\n\\nelaine: oh kramer. (they embrace) \\n\\njerry: could you excuse us please? \\n\\nkramer: what? \\n\\njerry: we\\'re talking. \\n\\nkramer: oh, the relationship. (he leaves) \\n\\njerry: you know, we never had one fight before this deal. \\n\\nelaine: i know. \\n\\njerry: never. \\n\\nelaine: ever. \\n\\njerry: we got along beautifully. \\n\\nelaine: like clams. \\n\\njerry: it was wonderful. \\n\\nelaine: a pleasure. \\n\\njerry: so i think we should just forget the whole deal, and go back to being friends. \\n\\nelaine: i can\\'t do it. \\n\\njerry: you what? \\n\\nelaine: i can\\'t do that. \\n\\njerry: you mean it\\'s... (she nods) no this. no that. no this or that. oh, boy. hmmm. what do you want? \\n\\nelaine: this, that, and the other. \\n\\njerry: oh, sure. of course, you\\'re entitled. who doesn\\'t want this, that, and the other? \\n\\nelaine: you. \\n\\njerry: (starts to correct then realizes) well... \\n\\ngeorge: those birthdays. i told you. they\\'re relationship killers. if a relationship is having any problems whatsoever, a birthday will always bring it out. \\n\\njerry: i never should have made up those rules. \\n\\ngeorge: what is it about sex that just disrupts everything? is it the touching? is it the nudity? \\n\\njerry: it can\\'t be the nudity. i never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when i was changing before gym class. \\n\\ngeorge: you know what this means? i can\\'t see her anymore either. \\n\\njerry: why? \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s break up by association. besides, she\\'s mad at me anyway because of my birthday present. \\n\\njerry: what did you end up giving her? \\n\\ngeorge: 91 dollars. \\n\\njerry: sorry about that. \\n\\ngeorge: so what\\'re you gonna do? \\n\\njerry: well, if i call her, there\\'s no joking around anymore. this is pretty much it. \\n\\ngeorge: so, maybe this should be it. \\n\\njerry: could be it. \\n\\ngeorge: she seems like an it. \\n\\njerry: she\\'s at it as you get. imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband. and she tells me he\\'s a sculptor, they live in vermont... \\n\\ngeorge: we\\'d have to kill him. \\n\\njerry: we\\'d get caught, i\\'d get the chair. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'d go to prison as your accomplice. i\\'d have to wear that really heavy denim. go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people. \\n\\njerry: plus, you know what else. \\n\\ngeorge: you better call her. \\n\\nkramer: hey. \\n\\njerry: hey. \\n\\nkramer: you got the paper yet? \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\nkramer: well where is it? (elaine enters from bedroom with newspaper) hey, you done with that? \\n\\nelaine: no. \\n\\nkramer: well, you\\'re not reading it now. \\n\\nelaine: all right, you can take it. but i want it back. \\n\\nkramer: oh yeah. so, ah, what\\'re you guys gonna do today? \\n\\nelaine: ah, this. and that. \\n\\njerry: and the other. \\n\\nkramer: boy, i really liked the two of you much better when you weren\\'t a couple. (he exits) \\n\\n[setting: night club] \\n\\njerry: men flip around the television more than women, i think. men get that remote control in their hands, they don\\'t even know what the hell they\\'re watching. you know, we just keep going, \"rerun, don\\'t wanna watch it.. \" \"what are you watching?\" \"i don\\'t care, i gotta keep going.\" \"who was that?\" \"i don\\'t know what it was - doesn\\'t matter, it\\'s not your fault. it doesn\\'t matter, i gotta keep going.\" women don\\'t do this. see now, women will stop and go, \"well, let me see what the show is before i change the channel.\" you see? men just fly. because women, you see, women nest and men hunt. that\\'s why we watch tv differently. before there was flipping around, before there was television, kings and emperors and pharaohs and such had story-tellers that would tell them stories \\'cause that was their entertainment. i always wonder, in that era, if they would get, like, thirty story-tellers together so they could still flip around. just go, \"alright start telling me a story, what\\'s happening? i don\\'t want to hear anymore. shut up. go to the next guy. what are you talking about? is there a girl in that story? ..no? shut up. go to the next guy. what do you got? i don\\'t want to hear that either. shut up. no, go ahead, what are you talking about?.. i don\\'t want to hear that. no, the all of you, get out of here. i\\'m going to bed.\" \\n\\n[setting: coffee shop] \\n\\ngeorge: (shocked) she\\'s pregnant? leslie is pregnant?! oh, see, there is no justice. \\n\\njerry: she\\'s the performance artist, right? \\n\\ngeorge: (sarcastic) yeah, performance artist. she\\'s a real performer. a real trooper. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s her husband\\'s name, again? chip? kip? skip? \\n\\nelaine: todd. \\n\\njerry: todd. oh yeah. (to george) he\\'s a kennedy. \\n\\nelaine: no, he\\'s not. \\n\\njerry: c\\'mon. he\\'s a third cousin, or something. \\n\\nelaine: by marriage. \\n\\njerry: oh, by marriage. (to george) we went to their wedding. you should have heard him talking about chappaquiddick - trying to blame the whole thing on bad directions. \\n\\ngeorge: that woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life. \\n\\nelaine: oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, intelligent woman. \\n\\ngeorge: what, you don\\'t think i can attract beautiful, intelligent women? \\n\\njerry: thin ice, george. thin ice.. \\n\\ngeorge: (sarcastic) maybe for her new performance piece she\\'ll give birth on stage. \\n\\nelaine: she stopped performing. \\n\\ngeorge: (again, sarcastic) oh, what a huge blow to the culture. \\n\\njerry: (gesturing to george) you believe this guy? he holds a grudge like khomeini. \\n\\ngeorge: she dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in brooklin to see one of her \"performances\". \\n\\njerry: oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity? \\n\\ngeorge: god! she\\'s cooking dinner for god! she\\'s yelling and screaming, and the next thing i know, she throws a big can of chocolate syrup all over my new red shirt. \\n\\nelaine: it was an accident! \\n\\ngeorge: oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. she was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire! then, for the rest of the show, i\\'m sitting there with chocolate all over my shirt. flies are landing on me. i\\'m boiling - i\\'m fantasizing all the things i\\'m gonna say when i see her. and later, finally, backstage when i talk to her, i\\'m a groveling worm. \"what kind of chocolate was that? do you throw any other foods?\" \\n\\njerry: (to elaine) he thought he still had a shot. \\n\\ngeorge: and then, then, then she leaves with somebody else! never even, never even said goodbye! never called me back.. never apologized. nothing. like i was dirt. \\n\\njerry: what ever happened with the shirt? \\n\\ngeorge: i still have it. the collar\\'s okay. i wear it under sweaters. \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t know what i\\'m gonna do. she asked me to give her a baby shower. \\n\\njerry: asked you? you\\'re not going to do that are you? \\n\\nelaine: anyone else, never. but, leslie - i have a problem saying no to. for some reason, i seem to want her approval. \\n\\ngeorge: let maria shriver give her a baby shower. \\n\\njerry: ask not what i can do for you - ask what you can do for me. \\n\\ngeorge: (germanic) ich bin ein sucker. \\n\\nelaine: oh, would you two stop with the kennedys? why does everybody make such a big deal about he kennedys? what is this fascination?! who cares?! it\\'s all so boring.. \\n\\ngeorge: she doesn\\'t deserve a baby shower. she deserves a baby monsoon. she deserves rosemary\\'s baby! \\n\\nelaine: (to jerry) i do have one teeny little problem, though. \\n\\ngeorge: never said goodbye. never apologized. nothing. \\n\\nelaine: see, i was gonna give the shower in my apartment.. \\n\\njerry: but? \\n\\nelaine: my roommate has lyme disease. \\n\\njerry: lyme disease? i thought she had epstein-barr syndrome? \\n\\nelaine: she has this in addition to epstein-barr. it\\'s like epstein-barr with a twist of lyme disease. \\n\\njerry: how did she get lyme disease? \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t know. she did some outdoor version of hair in danbury, connecticut. \\n\\njerry: they still do that play? \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s a classic. \\n\\njerry: with all the nudity? \\n\\nelaine: i guess. she must\\'ve rolled over on a tick during the love-in. \\n\\ngeorge: (still mad a leslie) never said goodbye. goodbye! \\n\\njerry: explain to me how this baby shower thing works. \\n\\nelaine: what do you wanna know? \\n\\njerry: well, i mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence? \\n\\nelaine: rarely. \\n\\njerry: there\\'s no hazing of the fetus, or anything, is there? \\n\\nelaine: no. \\n\\njerry: when is this suppose to be? \\n\\nelaine: saturday. \\n\\njerry: saturday?.. well, i have a show in buffalo on saturday. they\\'re not gonna bust up my apartment, or anything, are they? \\n\\nelaine: i\\'ll take full responsibility. you won\\'t regret it. \\n\\njerry: \\'cause i\\'ve seen these pregnant women - and they sometimes misjudge their fetal girth. just like one wrong turn, and boom! and entire buffet is swept off the table. \\n\\ngeorge: someday, before i die, mark my words - i\\'m gonna tell that woman exactly what i think of her. i\\'ll never be able to forgive myself until i do. \\n\\njerry: and if you do? \\n\\ngeorge: i still won\\'t be able to forgive myself - but at least it won\\'t be about this. \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\nkramer: what are you doing this for? look at you.. \\n\\njerry: quiet. i\\'m trying to get a picture. \\n\\nkramer: but you don\\'t have to do this! this guy is waiting in my house. \\n\\njerry: (pleading) leave me alone. \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s a one-time fee. a hundred and fifty bucks. why live like this?! \\n\\njerry: i\\'m not getting illegal cable! \\n\\nkramer: oh, so what are you gonna do? you gonna wait for the cable companies to resolve their dispute? they\\'re gonna be in court for years. \\n\\njerry: no, i read in the paper.. \\n\\nkramer: (sarcastic) oh, oh, the paper.. \\n\\njerry: well, they might hook us up again. \\n\\nkramer: oh, god, you\\'re so naive! all the cable companies care about is the \"big mammoo.\" (jerry wacks the tv) oh, look at you! you\\'re banging things.. pathetic. just wasting your life. i\\'m offering you fifty-six channels - movies, sports, nudity. and it\\'s free! for life! \\n\\njerry: stop shouting! you\\'re ruining the reception. \\n\\nkramer: can you hear yourself? can, can, do you know what you\\'re saying?! \\n\\njerry: what you\\'re suggesting is illegal. \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s not illegal. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s against the law. \\n\\nkramer: well, yeah. \\n\\njerry: (gesturing to the rabbit ears) just, just, hold this. can you hold that? \\n\\nkramer: (holding the rabbit ears) look, will you at least let me bring the guy over? he\\'s an amazing man. he\\'s a russian immigrant. he escaped the gulag. he\\'s like the sakharov of cable guys.. he\\'ll slow down your gas meter. he sells slugs, jerry. slugs for the subway. \\n\\njerry: a real human rights nut, huh? \\n\\nkramer: yeah. he\\'s intense, man. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know. what if i get caught? \\n\\nkramer: oh, you\\'re not gonna get caught. look, let me get him. man, it\\'s the nineties, it\\'s hammer time! come on, just let me get him. \\n\\njerry: you know, why don\\'t we wait? because, i\\'m going out of town tomarrow. \\n\\ntabachnick: tomarrow okay. \\n\\nkramer: no problem. yeah, you\\'ll have the whole thing installed by the time you get back. \\n\\njerry: (mutters to himself) every time i turn on the tv, sirens are gonna go off. they\\'re gonna track me down like a dog, i know it.. \\n\\nkramer: no, no, now look now, jerry, jerry, it\\'s no risk. i swear. the mets have seventy-five games on cable this year.. \\n\\njerry: (pauses, thinking about what kramer just said) put it in. \\n\\nkramer: you won\\'t regret it. (jerry mutters some more, kramer rubs his hands together in anticipation, then starts dancing around with a reluctant jerry) jerry\\'s gonna be a cable boy, a cable boy, a cable boy.. \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\nman: mr. steinfeld? \\n\\njerry: seinfeld. \\n\\nman: we\\'re with the fbi. you wanna tell us about your cable hook-up? \\n\\njerry: my cable hook-up? what about it? \\n\\nman: it\\'s been illegally installed, mr. steinfeld. \\n\\njerry: it has? i\\'ve been out of town. how did you know? \\n\\nkramer: jerry, i had to tell them. i had to. i had no choice. they were onto the scam from the very beginning. \\n\\nman: you\\'re in serious trouble, mr. steinfeld. \\n\\njerry: wait a minute. wait a minute, hold on! we\\'re just patsies. we\\'re just a couple of users.. we never sold the stuff. what about the russian guy? the russian guy is the guy you want. \\n\\ntabachnick: mr. seinfeld, agent stone. fbi. undercover. \\n\\nkramer: no! jerry! (the fbi agents open fire. jerry\\'s gunned down by a hailstorm of bullets. kramer leans next to a fallen jerry, cupping jerry\\'s head in his hands) cable boy, cable boy.. what have you done to my little cable boy?.. \\n\\n[setting: airplane] \\n\\njerry: excuse me. can i get something to drink? \\n\\nstewardess: i\\'m afraid not. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s with this airline? what are you, cutting out the drinks now? \\n\\nstewardess: no sir. we\\'re flying into a blizzard. please fasten your seat belt. we\\'re making an emergency landing. \\n\\njerry: (sarcastic) are they gonna go over the instructions again? \\n\\nbill: my name is bill. i might be the last person you ever see. \\n\\n[setting: night club] \\n\\njerry: i\\'m not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear of flying and, i have no arguement with that. i think fear of flying is quite rational because, human beings cannot fly. humans have fear of flying same way fish have fear of driving. put a fish behind the wheel, and they go, \"this isn\\'t right. i shouldn\\'t be doing this. i don\\'t belong here.\" \\n\\n[setting: george\\'s car] \\n\\ngeorge: sounds like a rough trip. \\n\\njerry: oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway. and then, when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed. \\n\\ngeorge: so, the college cancelled the gig? \\n\\njerry: well, there was so much snow. the roads were closed. i really appreciate it - you picking me up. thanks again. \\n\\ngeorge: (modestly) forget it. \\n\\njerry: no, really.. an airport run. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s nothing. \\n\\njerry: hey, it\\'s one thing if i asked you \"could you do me a favor?\" ..but to suggest it?.. george (obviously up to something. jerry doesn\\'t suspect anything - yet) whey you told me what you went through on the plane, it makes you stop and think. you appreciate having a real friend. \\n\\njerry: (joking) you know, if richie brandes did this, i\\'d be suspicious, you know. he\\'s always got some ulterior motive. \\n\\ngeorge: (laughs nervously) ..ulterior motive. \\n\\njerry: oh, wait a minute. wait a minute. don\\'t take the bridge.. get off here. we can\\'t go back to my place, elaine\\'s having the shower. \\n\\ngeorge: (obviously knows that, but pretends he doesn\\'t) what, tonight? now? \\n\\njerry: yeah, yeah. i forgot all about it. alright, it\\'s no big deal. we\\'ll just go back to your place. \\n\\ngeorge: my place? no, no, no. i hate my place. i don\\'t wanna go back to my place. \\n\\njerry: you want to get a bite? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, i would. it\\'s just, you know, i just ate a whole pot roast. \\n\\njerry: well, so what should we do? \\n\\ngeorge: shouldn\\'t we at least drop off your bag? \\n\\njerry: red shirt! red shirt! that\\'s the red shirt! \\n\\ngeorge: (nervous) what are you talking about? \\n\\njerry: you\\'re wearing the chocolate shirt! \\n\\ngeorge: i am? what a strange coincidence.. \\n\\njerry: a - ha! nice try, my friend, but you gotta get up pretty early in the morning.. \\n\\ngeorge: (pleading) you gotta let me go over there. \\n\\njerry: what are you gonna do? badger a pregnant woman at her own baby shower?! what are you, gonna take it off and make her rinse it in club soda? \\n\\ngeorge: no, i\\'m gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the scent of stale bosco that i had to live with for three years, and i\\'m gonna say, \"remember this shirt, baby?! well, now, it\\'s payback time!\" \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\nleslie: we just bought an apartment on riverside drive. bernard goetz\\'s mother used to live there. \\n\\nelaine: so, where\\'s todd?

(the russians get to work on command. to elaine) look, it\\'s gonna take a few minutes.. then, you and the gals can take a load off and watch something on lifetime. \\n\\n[setting: george\\'s car] \\n\\njerry: and what if we go up there? what are you going to say to her? \\n\\ngeorge: (boiling) what am i going to say?! \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: what did you go out with me for?! just to dump chocolate on my shirt and then just dump me altogether?! i don\\'t deserve that kind of treatment! what, you don\\'t have the common courtesy to return my calls?! to apologize! you think i\\'m some sort of a loser, that likes to be abused and ignored?! who\\'s shirt can be ruined without financial restitution?! some sort of a masochist who enjoys being humiliated? you think you can avoid me like i have some sort of disease?! you have the disease! you have the disease! you may be beautiful and rich and physically .. just .. unbelievable, but you sicken me! you disgust me! you and everyone like you! \\n\\njerry: you\\'ll never say that to her face. \\n\\ngeorge: watch me. \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\nkramer: (flirting with a female guest) yeah, i eat the whole apple. the core, stem, seeds, everything. \\n\\nelaine: (to kramer) kramer, kramer, look at him. (gestures to tabachnick) look! he\\'s eating all the food! \\n\\nkramer: yeah, yeah. well, you know, there are many differences between american and soviet cultures that you\\'re not aware of. see, in russian, the cable guy, they got the whole run of the house. yeah, that\\'s tradition. (turns back to the woman) did you ever eat the bark of a pineapple? \\n\\nelaine: kramer! \\n\\nkramer: (trying to break up the fight) uh.. excuse me.. \\n\\nelaine: what are you doing here? i thought you were out of town for the weekend. \\n\\njerry: the show was cancelled. there was a blizzard. \\n\\nelaine: i can\\'t believe you told kramer it\\'s okay to put the cable in during the shower! jerry, look,, look! they\\'ve eaten everything. \\n\\nleslie: jerry, what a surprise! i thought you sere out of town. \\n\\njerry: well, leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason. \\n\\nelaine: (speaking confidentially to george) george, don\\'t even think about it! don\\'t even dream about it! \\n\\ngeorge: (unconvincingly coy) about what? \\n\\ntabachnick: (sticks his head out the door) kramer, kramer, kramer.. \\n\\ngeorge: leslie. \\n\\nleslie: yeah? \\n\\ngeorge: george.. (she doesn\\'t seem to recognize him) george costanza. \\n\\nleslie: hi. \\n\\ngeorge: (laughs) you, i guess, you don\\'t remember me.. but we actually, kind of um.. went out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. remember? \\n\\nleslie: vaguely. \\n\\ngeorge: you took me to one of your shows.. \\n\\nleslie: and? \\n\\ngeorge: and, um, it was quite good. in fact, you even incorporated me into the show. i\\'m not actually a performer. although, my parents felt i had talent.. \\n\\nmary: jerry?! (a woman, angry at jerry, approaches him. jerry looks confused) remember me? \\n\\njerry: i\\'m sorry, i.. \\n\\nmary: (livid) mary contardi. no? doesn\\'t ring a bell, jerry? we had a date, three years ago. you took me to one of your shows. \\n\\njerry: (stammering) oh, i, i, think i remember.. \\n\\nmary: told me you had a great time! said you\\'d call me the next day. \\n\\njerry: well, i\\'m sure i meant to call.. i probably just lost your.. \\n\\nmary: liar! liar! you were never going to call me! you thought you could waltz throught the rest of your life and never bump into me again! but you were wrong, jerry! you were wrong! what do you think, i\\'m some sort of poor, pathetic wretch?! \\n\\njerry: no, i don\\'t think that.. \\n\\nmarry: some person who could be dismissed and ignored?! some insignificant piece of dust?! some person who doesn\\'t deserve your respect and your attention?! you\\'re the one that doesn\\'t deserve my respect and my attention! you\\'re the insignificant piece of dust! \\n\\ngeorge: actually, i never had any formal training. i guess i\\'d be better suited for improvs, or something.. \\n\\nleslie: thanks a lot! \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m sorry you have to go. \\n\\nwoman: yeah. i really have to be going. \\n\\njerry: alright, listen, i\\'ve changed my mind about this whole thing. i don\\'t want cable. \\n\\nkramer: don\\'t be a fool. \\n\\ntabachnick: you don\\'t want? \\n\\njerry: no, i don\\'t want. so, just tell me what i owe you for your trouble.. \\n\\ntabachnick: (confers with his assistant, then) four hundred dollars. \\n\\njerry: (to kramer) four hundred dollars?1 you told me one-fifty! \\n\\nleslie: i\\'m going.. obviously. \\n\\nelaine: oh, leslie, i am so sorry about everything that went on here tonight. you know, i had no idea.. \\n\\nleslie: elaine, you know, i was watching you tonight, and i realized something. you\\'re just like you were in college. \\n\\nelaine: (not sure if it was an insult or a compliment) oh, thank you. (leslie leaves. then elaine wonders to herself) \"like you were in college\"? \\n\\nleslie: (comes back, and yells in the direction of the bedroom) come on! let\\'s go! \\n\\ngeorge: (sheepishly to elaine) i\\'ll be right back. (leaves) \\n\\njerry: (defiantly) i\\'m not paying four hundred dollars! i don\\'t even want the thing. what are you going to do?! \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\ngeorge: every woman on the face of the earth has complete control of my life. and yet, i want them all.. is that irony? \\n\\nelaine: why can\\'t i meet a kennedy? ..i saw john junior once downtown. i was on a bus. i hit the ding, but.. it didn\\'t stop. \\n\\njerry: alright, i said i had a good time and i\\'d call, but who takes that literally? \\n\\nkramer: (pops his head into jerry\\'s apartment) hey, come on over, dr. zhivago\\'s on cable in five minutes.. i\\'m making popcorn! (leaves) \\n\\n[setting: night club] \\n\\njerry: what do you do at the end of a date when you know you don\\'t want to see this person ever again, for the rest of your life? what do you say? what do you say? no matter what you say, it\\'s a lie. \"i\\'ll see you around. see you around. if you\\'re around, and i\\'m around, i\\'ll see you around that area. you\\'ll be around other people. you won\\'t be around me. but you will be around.\" \"take care now.\" did you ever say that to somebody? \"take care now. take care, now. because, i\\'m not going to be taking care of you. so, you should take care, now.\" \"take care. take care.\" what does this mean? \"take off!\" isn\\'t that what you really want to say? \"take off now.\" \\n\\njerry: (a couple of days ago i used a public phone), go over time on the call, hang up the phone, walk away. you\\'ve had this happen? phone rings. it\\'s the phone company... they want more money. don\\'t you love this? and you got them right where you want them for the first time in your life. you\\'re on the street, there\\'s nothing they can do. i like to let it ring a few times, you know, let her sweat a little over there, then i just pick it up, \"yeah, operator... oh, i got the money... i got the money right here... d\\'you hear that? (taps on microphone) that\\'s a quarter. yeah, you want that don\\'t you?\" \\n\\nelaine: no, they\\'ve just got to get more cops on the force, it\\'s as simple as that. \\n\\ngeorge: cops. i don\\'t even care about cops. i wanna see more garbage men. it\\'s much more important. all i wanna see are garbage trucks, garbage cans and garbage men. you\\'re never gonna stop crime, we should at least be clean. \\n\\njerry: i tell you what they should do, they should combine the two jobs, make it one job, \\'cop\\\\garbage man\\'. i always see cops walking around with nothing to do. grab a broom! start sweeping. you sweep sweep sweep... catch a criminal, get right back to sweeping. \\n\\nelaine: you should run for mayor. \\n\\njerry: ehh, nobody listens. \\n\\nelaine: where is someone? i\\'m starving. \\n\\ngeorge: i think this is him right here. \\n\\nelaine: is there a table ready? \\n\\nrestaurant manager (bruce): how many? \\n\\nelaine (to jerry): how many? \\n\\njerry (to george): is tatiana coming? \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t know, i have to call her, tell her where we are. i\\'m very lucky she\\'s even considering seeing me at all. \\n\\njerry: really? i thought things were going ok. \\n\\ngeorge: they were, it\\'s kinda complicated. \\n\\njerry: well what is it? \\n\\nelaine: how many? \\n\\njerry: ah, alright, four. seinfeld. \\n\\nbruce: four. it\\'ll be five, ten minutes. \\n\\ngeorge: what do you wanna do? \\n\\nelaine: let\\'s go someplace else, i am too hungry. \\n\\njerry: we might as well just stay here, we haven\\'t got that much time if we wanna make it to the movie. \\n\\ngeorge: i gotta call tatiana. where\\'s the phone? \\n\\njerry (to elaine): tatiana... \\n\\ngeorge: excuse me, are you gonna be very long? \\n\\nbruce: lashbrook, 4! \\n\\njerry: so did i do a terrible thing? \\n\\nelaine: you mean lying to your uncle? \\n\\njerry: i couldn\\'t have dinner with him. \\'plan 9 from outer space\\', one night only, the big screen. my hands are tied! \\n\\ngeorge (to jerry): you know it\\'s a public phone, you\\'re not supposed to just chit-chat. \\n\\nelaine: jerry, get menus so when we sit down we can order right away. \\n\\njerry: can\\'t look at a menu now, i gotta be at the table. \\n\\ngeorge: he knows i\\'m waiting. he sees me. he just doesn\\'t wanna look. \\n\\nelaine: everything\\'s gotta be just so with you, doesn\\'t it? \\n\\njerry: hey, i offered you those cookies in my house. \\n\\nelaine: health cookies. i hate those little dustboard fructose things. \\n\\ngeorge: i just can\\'t believe at the way people are. what is it with humanity? what kind of a world do we live in? \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\njerry: there\\'s a woman over there that looks really familiar. dark hair, striped shirt? \\n\\nelaine: i\\'ve never seen her before. \\n\\njerry: i know this woman. this is gonna drive me crazy. \\n\\nman: oh, excuse me. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m sorry. \\n\\nelaine: didja see that? those people, look, they\\'re getting a table. \\n\\njerry: well maybe they were here from before. \\n\\nelaine: no no no, they weren\\'t here before. \\n\\ngeorge (to guy): excuse me, are you going to be much longer? i have to make a very important call. \\n\\nelaine: find out what\\'s going on! \\n\\njerry: excuse me, didn\\'t those people just come in? i believe we were ahead of them. \\n\\nelaine: yeah. \\n\\nbruce: what\\'s your name? \\n\\njerry: seinfeld. \\n\\nbruce: no, no, they were here before. keckitch(sp?), 2! \\n\\nelaine: did you ever notice how happy people are when they finally get a table? they think they\\'re so special because they\\'ve been chosen. it\\'s enough to make you sick. \\n\\njerry: boy, you are really hungry. \\n\\ngeorge (whistles to guy on phone): hey! \\n\\ngeorge: if anything happens here, can i count on you? \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\ngeorge: if we decide to go at it. \\n\\njerry: yeah, i wanna get into a rumble... \\n\\ngeorge: i have to get in touch with tatiana! and look at his little outfit. it\\'s all so coordinated, the way his socks matching to his shirt. i really hate this guy. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m gonna faint... \\n\\njerry: george, who is that woman in the stripes? \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t know her. \\n\\njerry: she looks so familiar. \\n\\nelaine: ya know, its not fair people are seated first come first served, it should be based on who\\'s hungriest. i feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebody\\'s plate. \\n\\njerry: i\\'ll tell you what, there\\'s 50 bucks in it for you if you do it. \\n\\nelaine: what do you mean? \\n\\njerry: you walk over that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don\\'t say anything, you eat it, say \\'thank you very much\\', wipe your mouth, walk away- i give you 50 bucks. \\n\\ngeorge: what are they gonna do? \\n\\njerry: they won\\'t do anything; in fact, you\\'ll be giving them a story to tell for the rest of their lives. \\n\\nelaine: 50 bucks, you\\'ll give me 50 bucks? \\n\\njerry: 50 bucks. that table over there, the three couples. \\n\\nelaine: ok, i don\\'t wanna go over there and do it, and then come back here and find out there was some little loophole, like i didn\\'t put mustard on it or something... \\n\\njerry: no, no tricks. \\n\\nelaine: should i do it, george? \\n\\ngeorge: for 50 bucks? i\\'d put my face in the soup and blow. \\n\\nelaine: alright, alright. here, hold this. i\\'m doin\\' it. \\n\\nelaine (through her teeth): i know this sounds crazy, but the two men who are standing behind me are going to give me 50 bucks if i stand here and eat one of your eggrolls. \\n\\nelaine (through teeth): i\\'ll give you 25 if you let me do it. \\n\\npeople at table: what? what is she talking about? what did she say? \\n\\njerry: what happened? \\n\\nelaine: did you see that? \\n\\ngeorge: what were you doing? \\n\\nelaine (laughing): i offered them 25, they had no idea... \\n\\njerry: george, the phone\\'s free. \\n\\ngeorge: alleluia. \\n\\ngeorge: excuse me, i was waiting here. \\n\\nwoman at phone: where? i didn\\'t see you. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'ve been standing here for the last ten minutes! \\n\\nwoman: well i won\\'t be long. \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s not the point. the point is i was here first. \\n\\nwoman: well if you were here first, you\\'d be holding the phone. \\n\\ngeorge (yelling at her): you know, we\\'re living in a society! we\\'re supposed to act in a civilized way. \\n\\ngeorge: does she care? no. does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity over the problems of a fellow individual? no. no. a resounding no! \\n\\nguy: hey, sorry i took so long. \\n\\ngeorge: oh that\\'s ok, really, don\\'t worry about it. \\n\\nelaine: how do people fast? did ghandi get this crazy? i\\'m gonna walk around, see what dishes look good. \\n\\njerry: i told my uncle i had a stomach ache tonight. you think he bought that? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, well, he probably bought it. \\n\\njerry: so what happened with tatiana? \\n\\ngeorge: i shouldn\\'t even tell you this. \\n\\njerry: come on... \\n\\ngeorge: well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m with you. \\n\\ngeorge: well, it\\'s this little place with this little bathroom. it\\'s like right there, you know, it\\'s not even down a little hall or off in an alcove. you understand? there\\'s no... buffer zone. so, we start to fool around, and it\\'s the first time, and it\\'s early in the going. and i begin to perceive this impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm. so i know i\\'m gonna have to stop. and as this is happening i\\'m thinking, even if i can somehow manage to momentarily... extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force, i know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that i know i\\'m going to need... \\n\\njerry: this could only happen to you. \\n\\ngeorge: so i finally stop and say, \"tatiana, i hope you don\\'t take this the wrong way, but i think it would be best if i left\". \\n\\njerry: you said this to her after. \\n\\ngeorge: no. during. \\n\\njerry: oh, boy. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. \\n\\njerry: wow! so...? \\n\\ngeorge: so i\\'m dressing and she\\'s staring up at me, struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events. i don\\'t know what to say to reassure this woman, and worst of all, i don\\'t have the time to say it. the only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if i told her i am in reality batman, and i\\'m very sorry, i just saw the bat-signal. it took me 3 days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again. now she\\'s waiting for me to call her, and she\\'s \\n\\nelaine: i hate this place. i don\\'t know why we came here, i\\'m never coming back here again. \\n\\njerry (still trying to remember): who is that woman?! \\n\\nelaine: remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? remember, it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never saw before, and they put it in front of you, and it is such a delicious and exciting adventure? and now i just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them to fill up the trough. \\n\\ngeorge: she\\'s off. (goes over to the now available public phone) \\n\\nelaine: jerry, talk to that guy again. \\n\\njerry: what am i gonna say? \\n\\nelaine: tell him we wanna catch a movie and that we\\'re late. \\n\\nmr. cohen: hey, what stinks in here? \\n\\nbruce (laughing): mr. cohen! haven\\'t seen you for a couple of weeks. \\n\\nmr. cohen: well, i\\'ve been looking for a better place. \\n\\nbruce: better place... want a table? \\n\\nmr. cohen: no, just bring me a plate and i\\'ll eat here. \\n\\nbruce (laughing): give him a plate and you eat here... come on, i give you a table. \\n\\njerry: excuse me... we\\'ve been waiting here. now, i know we were ahead of that guy, he just came in. \\n\\nbruce: oh no, mr. cohen always here. \\n\\nelaine: he\\'s always here? what does that mean? what does that mean? \\n\\nbruce: oh, mr. cohen, very nice man. he live on park avenue. \\n\\nelaine: where am i? is this a dream? what in god\\'s name is going on here?! \\n\\ngeorge: she\\'s not there. she left. she must\\'ve waited and left because those people wouldn\\'t get off the phone. \\n\\njerry: didja leave a message? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, i told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the phone to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses. i better tell him i\\'m expecting a call. \\n\\nelaine: oh, jerry, here comes that woman... \\n\\njerry: where do i know her? \\n\\nlorraine: hello, jerry! \\n\\njerry: heeeeyyyy... how you doin\\'? \\n\\nlorraine: how is everything? \\n\\njerry: good, good, good... what\\'s goin\\' on? \\n\\nlorraine: oh, working hard. and you? \\n\\njerry: oh, you know, working around, same stuff, doing... whatever. \\n\\nlorraine: you haven\\'t been around in a while. \\n\\njerry: i know, i know... well, you know. \\n\\nlorraine: you should come by. \\n\\njerry: definitely. i plan to, i\\'m not just saying that. \\n\\nelaine: hi, i\\'m elaine. \\n\\nlorraine (shaking her hand): lorraine. catalano. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m sorry, lorraine, this is elaine... \\n\\nlorraine: well it was nice seeing you, jerry. and nice meeting you. (she leaves) \\n\\nelaine (smug): oh, nice to meet you too, lorraine! \\n\\njerry: oh my god, lorraine... that\\'s lorraine from my uncle\\'s office. i\\'m in big, big trouble. \\n\\nelaine: the one you broke the plans with tonight? \\n\\njerry: yeah, she works in his office. now she\\'s gonna see him tomorrow and tell him she saw me here tonight. he\\'s gonna tell his wife, his wife\\'s gonna call my mother. oh, this is bad, you don\\'t know, the chain reaction of calls this is gonna set off. new york, long island, florida, it\\'s like the bermuda triangle. unfortunately, nobody ever disappears. my uncle to my aunt, my aunt to my mother, my mother to my uncle... \\n\\njerry: ...my uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me. \\n\\nelaine: you should\\'ve just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in over with. it\\'s just a movie. \\n\\njerry: just a movie?! you don\\'t understand. this isn\\'t \\'plans 1 through 8 from outer space\\', this is \\'plan 9\\', this is the one that worked. the worst movie ever made! \\n\\njerry: hey, i got news for you, if we\\'re making this movie, we gotta get a table immediately. \\n\\nelaine: alright, ok. let\\'s stop fooling around. let\\'s just slip him some money. \\n\\njerry: in a chinese restaurant? do they take money? \\n\\nelaine: do they take money? everyone takes money. i used to go out with a guy who did it all the time, you just slip him 20 bucks. \\n\\ngeorge: 20 bucks? isn\\'t that excessive? \\n\\nelaine: well what do you want to give him, change? \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s more than the meal! \\n\\njerry: oh, come on, we\\'ll divide it up three ways. \\n\\ngeorge: alright. 7,7, (points at himself) 6. i\\'m not gonna eat that much! \\n\\njerry: i\\'m counting your shrimps. ok, who\\'s gonna do it? \\n\\ngeorge: oh no, i can\\'t do it. i-i\\'m not good at these things, i get flustered. once i tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby, i almost got arrested. \\n\\nelaine: i guess it\\'s you, jer. \\n\\njerry: me? what about you? \\n\\nelaine: oh, i can\\'t do that, it\\'s a guy thing. \\n\\njerry: the woman\\'s movement just can\\'t seem to make any progress in the world of bribery, can they? \\n\\nelaine: give me the money. \\n\\nelaine: how\\'s it going\\'? \\n\\nbruce: very busy. \\n\\nelaine: boy, we are really anxious to sit down. \\n\\nbruce: very good specials tonight. \\n\\nelaine: if there\\'s anything you can do to get us a table we\\'d really appreciate it. \\n\\nbruce: what is your name? (he turns the page over the money) \\n\\nelaine: no no, i want to eat now! (she gets the money from under the page) \\n\\nbruce: yes, we have sea-bass dinner tonight, very fresh. \\n\\nelaine (gives him the money): here, take this. i\\'m starving. take it! take it! \\n\\nbruce: dennison, 4! (goes over to 4 ladies) your table is ready. \\n\\nelaine: no no, no, i want that table. i want that table! oh, come on, did you see that? what was that? he took the money, he didn\\'t give us a table. \\n\\njerry: you lost the 20. \\n\\nelaine: well, how could he do that? \\n\\ngeorge: you didn\\'t make it clear. \\n\\nelaine: make it clear? \\n\\njerry: what a sorry exhibition that was. alright, let me get the money back. \\n\\nbruce: your name? \\n\\njerry: seinfeld. \\n\\nbruce: yeah, seinfeld 4! \\n\\njerry: no no no, you see the girl there, with the long hair? \\n\\nbruce: oh yes, yes. very beautiful girl, very beautiful. is your girlfriend? \\n\\njerry: well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it\\'s really not relevant here. \\n\\nbruce: relationships are difficult. it\\'s very hard to stay together- \\n\\njerry: alright, listen, alright. how much longer is it gonna be? \\n\\nbruce: oh. in about five, ten minutes. \\n\\ngeorge: so? \\n\\njerry: there seems to be a bit of a discrepancy. \\n\\nelaine: so when are we gonna eat? \\n\\njerry: five, ten minutes. \\n\\ngeorge: we should have left earlier. i told you. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t see any way we can eat and make this movie. \\n\\nelaine: oh, well i have to eat. \\n\\njerry: well let\\'s just order to go, we\\'ll eat it in the cab. \\n\\nelaine: eat it in the cab? chinese food in a cab? \\n\\njerry: we\\'ll eat it in the movie. \\n\\nelaine: oh, who do you think you\\'re going? do you think that they have big picnic tables there? \\n\\njerry: well what do you suggest? \\n\\nelaine: i say we leave now, we go to \\'skyburger\\' and we scarf \\'em down. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m not going to \\'skyburger\\'. besides, it\\'s in the opposite direction, let\\'s just eat popcorn or something. \\n\\nbruce (holding a phone): cartwright? \\n\\nelaine: i can\\'t have popcorn for dinner! \\n\\nbruce: cartwright? \\n\\nelaine (tries to snatch food off a waiter\\'s tray): i have to eat! \\n\\njerry: so they have hotdogs there. \\n\\nelaine: oh, movie hotdogs! i rather lick the food off the floor. \\n\\ngeorge: i can\\'t go anywhere, i have to wait here for tatiana\\'s call. let me just check. \\n\\ngeorge: excuse me, i\\'m expecting a call. costanza? \\n\\nbruce: yeah, i just got a call. i yell \\'cartwright! cartwright!\\', just like that. nobody came up, i hang up. \\n\\ngeorge: well, was it for costanza or... \\n\\nbruce: yes, yes, that\\'s it. nobody answered. \\n\\ngeorge: well was it a woman? \\n\\nbruce: yeah, yeah. i tell her you not here, she said curse word, i hang up. \\n\\ngeorge: she called. he yelled cartwright. i missed her. \\n\\njerry: who\\'s cartwright? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m cartwright! \\n\\njerry: you\\'re not cartwri- \\n\\ngeorge: of course i\\'m not cartwright! look, why don\\'t you two just go to the movies all by yourselves, i\\'m not in the mood. \\n\\nelaine: well me neither, i\\'m goin\\' to \\'skyburger\\'. \\n\\njerry: so you\\'re not going? \\n\\nelaine: you don\\'t need us. \\n\\njerry: well i can\\'t go to a bad movie by myself. who am i gonna make sarcastic remarks to, strangers? eh, i guess i\\'ll just go to my uncle\\'s. \\n\\ngeorge: should we tell him we\\'re leaving? \\n\\nelaine: what for? let\\'s just get out of here. \\n\\nbruce: seinfeld, 4? \\n\\njerry: hunger will make people do amazing things. i mean, the proof of that is cannibalism. cannibalism, what do they say, i mean, they\\'re eating and, you know, \"this is good, who is this? i like this person\". you know, i mean, i would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very deep sleep, you know what i mean? i would think, you\\'d be like, (pretending to wake up) \"who is that? who\\'s there? who\\'s there? is somebody there? what do you want? what do you want? you look hungry, are you hungry? get out of here!\" \\n\\n[setting: night club] \\n\\njerry: i\\'m not a foodie. i don\\'t, \"oh, this is too rare. oh, it\\'s too salty.\" just eat it and shut up. i\\'ll eat anywhere, whatever they\\'re having. i have eaten rotten rolls off of room service trays in hotel hallways. i have. it\\'s not a joke. this is my life. i don\\'t know, somebody left it. why would someone poison a roll, and leave it in a hallway for some comic coming down at two o\\' clock in the morning? why would they do that? sometimes you go to a nice restaurant, they put the check in a little book. what is this? the story of the bill? \"once upon a time, there were some very hungry people..\" what is this? a little gold tassle hanging down? am i graduating from the restaurant? what is this about? \\n\\n[setting: a restaurant] \\n\\nelaine: do you want some of mine? \\n\\njerry: take some of mine. \\n\\ngeorge: why do i get pesto? why do i think i\\'ll like it? i keep trying to like it, like i have to like it. \\n\\njerry: who said you have to like it? \\n\\ngeorge: everybody likes pesto. you walk into a restaurant, that\\'s all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t like pesto. \\n\\ngeorge: where was pesto 10 years ago? \\n\\njerry: (gesturing to a man) look at that guy. (elaine starts to look, but jerry stops her) i\\'ll bet you he\\'s gettin\\' hair transplants. any time you see a guy that age wearing a baseball cap, ten to one - plugs. \\n\\nelaine: (elaine turns to look at the man, trying to make it sound like they aren\\'t talking about him) the thing about that painting.. is with the colors and um.. (turns back to jerry) oh yeah, plugola. \\n\\njerry: (to elaine) oh, one more thing about the car. let it warm up for a minute. \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s a tough minute. it\\'s like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t understand why he couldn\\'t take a cab. \\n\\ngeorge: who? \\n\\njerry: elaine is having a \"houseguest.\" she\\'s picking him up at the airport tonight. \\n\\ngeorge: a guy? \\n\\nelaine: (slightly embarrassed) yes, a guy. \\n\\njerry: he\\'s from a.. yakima, right? \\n\\nelaine: seattle. \\n\\njerry: everybody\\'s moving to seattle. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s the pesto of cities. so..? \\n\\nelaine: (to jerry) you tell him. \\n\\njerry: well, from what i can piece together, our friend here met a gentleman. \\n\\nelaine: ed. \\n\\njerry: who was in town on a business venture, and um.. \\n\\nelaine: ..we shared an interpersonal experience. (george hits his glass with his fork. to jerry) go on. \\n\\njerry: so they went out a few times, but apparently, when the fellow returned home, he discovered that the benes tattoo does not wash off so easily. \\n\\nelaine: on some people. \\n\\ngeorge: oooh. \\n\\njerry: so, he\\'s coming in to stay with her for a week. \\n\\nelaine: it was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became a week. \\n\\nmanager: what happened? \\n\\ngeorge: oh, the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle. \\n\\nmanager: sorry to the disturbance. \\n\\nelaine: (joking, she snobbishly says) i\\'m never eating here again. \\n\\njerry: (pats george on the back) nice going. thank you, that ought to get us a free dessert.. (they can see the manager chewing the busboy out from the dining room doorway) i think the busboy\\'s in trouble. \\n\\ngeorge: did i get him in trouble? because of what i said?! i just told him what happened.. he didn\\'t do it on purpose.. (mangager and busboy are arguing. the busboy points in the direction of george) he pointed at me. why did he point at me?! \\n\\nelaine: i said i would never eat here again.. but, i, i.. he had to know i was kidding. \\n\\njerry: (casually buttering a roll, like he\\'s the innocent one) i didn\\'t say anything. \\n\\ngeorge: i can\\'t believe it. he\\'s going! he\\'s fired! \\n\\nelaine: oh, i said it in a kidding way. \\n\\ngeorge: i didn\\'t know he\\'d get fired. \\n\\njerry: (jokingly trying to put more pressure on elaine and george) he\\'ll probably kill his family over this. \\n\\ngeorge: what if he\\'s waiting for me outside? he pointed at me! did you see him point?! \\n\\njerry: (again, joking) a lot of ex-cons become busboys. they seem to gravitate twards \\'em. \\n\\ngeorge: was it my fault? \\n\\nelaine: was it my fault? \\n\\njerry: (doesn\\'t have a care in the world) ..maybe i\\'ll try that pesto. \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\njerry: look, i feel bad for him too, but he\\'ll get another job. i mean, let\\'s face it, it\\'s not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of grueling interviews. \\n\\ngeorge: (eating a sandwich) oh, like you really know busboys. \\n\\njerry: oh, like you do. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, at least i was a camp waiter. \\n\\njerry: (scoffing) camp. \\n\\ngeorge: it was a fat camp. those kids depended on me. \\n\\njerry: elaine? \\n\\nelaine: (through intercom) yeah. \\n\\njerry: busboys are always changing jobs. that\\'s the business. i know. i work with these guys. i tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs. \\n\\ngeorge: then why don\\'t you try and get him another job? \\n\\njerry: i\\'d love to, but i don\\'t know anything about him. he could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins. \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t know if you people are aware of this, but i am one clever chickadee. \\n\\ngeorge: what? did you get the busboy\\'s number? \\n\\nelaine: his phone\\'s been disconnected, but i was able to obtain an address - 1324 amsterdam avenue, apartment 4d. (hands george a card) now, i did my job. (to jerry) may i have the car keys, please? \\n\\ngeorge: how did you get all this? \\n\\nelaine: does the word \"charm\" mean anything to you? \\n\\njerry: no. (george grabs his jacket) so now you\\'re going to his apartment? i really think this is nuts. \\n\\ngeorge: (putting his jacket on) i\\'d like to apologize. i want to tell him i.. i.. didn\\'t mean to get him in trouble. \\n\\njerry: you, you\\'re going now? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, i want to see if there\\'s anything i can do.. maybe get him another job.. maybe i\\'ll hear of something. \\n\\njerry: maybe the fat camp. (to elaine) you\\'re not going? \\n\\nelaine: i would, but i have to pick up ed at the airport. \\n\\njerry: i just don\\'t think you should go alone. can\\'t you wait till after my set? \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'ll take to long. \\n\\njerry: take the k-man. a little support.. \\n\\ngeorge: (unsure) i don\\'t a.. \\n\\nkramer: take me where? where? \\n\\n[setting: an apartment building hallway] \\n\\ngeorge: look, i really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn\\'t mind - try not to say too much. \\n\\nkramer: what am i gonna say? \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t know. \\n\\nkramer: well, i\\'m not an idiot. \\n\\ngeorge: certainly not. \\n\\nkramer: then we\\'re cool. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah.. yeah, we\\'re - we\\'re cool. (knocks lightly. kramer takes charge by knocking on the door louder. the busboy answers) uh, i\\'m sorry to bother you, i was in the restaurant earlier and i was wondering if i could talk to you for a few minutes about what happened. (he gestures for them to come in. they obey) i hope i\\'m not interrupting anything. it\\'s just that i think i may have - without realizing it - been responsible for getting you fired. (nervously laughs) and.. and.. and i just want you to know that i didn\\'t intend for that to happen. \\n\\nkramer: (patting george on the shoulder) he\\'s a hell of a guy. \\n\\ngeorge: this is a guy i know.. kramer. \\n\\nkramer: habla espanol? \\n\\ngeorge: (to himself) oh my god. \\n\\nantonio: si. \\n\\nkramer: como se dice.. waterbed? \\n\\ngeorge: (interrupting) anyway, i just wanted to let you know i\\'m really sorry that happened, and if i can help out in any way, i\\'ll certainly be glad to do that. (pause) well, i guess that\\'s about it. \\n\\nkramer: you got anything to drink? agua? \\n\\ngeorge: oy uy uy.. (antonio points to the sink) we really should get going. \\n\\nkramer: let me get a glass of water. (heads tward the sink) \\n\\ngeorge: hurry up. \\n\\nantonio: (notices that his cat is missing) pequita? pequita? (starts to panic) \\n\\nkramer: his cat\\'s gone. \\n\\nantonio: (notes the door was left wide open) la puerta esta abierta. (starts screaming) la puerta esta abierta! (to kramer and george) who left the door open? (silence) who left the door open?! (kramer and george look at eachother) come on, come on! help me look! (all three head out the door to look) \\n\\n[setting: antonio\\'s apartment] \\n\\nkramer: ..you know, cats run away all the time. you know, my aunt, she had a cat. ran away. showed up three years later.. you never know. they got things in \\n\\ngeorge: (gestures for kramer to shut up) once again, antonio, i can\\'t even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry i am about everything. the job, the cat.. (a lamp breaks) the lamp. \\n\\nkramer: the wire was sticking out.. (fits the two broken pieces together) yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: (hands antonio a card) here\\'s my card. i\\'m in real estate, so, if you\\'re ever looking for something bigger, something nicer.. (antonio is staring at him, angered) ..maybe not right now. anyway.. (extends his hand for a handshake. antonio doesn\\'t move) \\n\\nkramer: you oughta get that wire fixed. (they go to leave) i got the door. (shuts the door, the broken lamp falls to the floor) \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\njerry: (on the phone) george, stop worrying about this guy. it wasn\\'t your fault.. come on, he\\'s not stalking you. \\n\\nkramer: hey. \\n\\njerry: (to kramer) hey. (to george) he doesn\\'t even know where you live.. who told you to give him your business card?.. (intercom buzzes) that\\'s elaine. (kramer buzzes her in. jerry talks into the phone) kramer.. (to kramer) george wants to know when you want to look for the cat again. \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s been a week. it\\'s up to the cat now. \\n\\njerry: (into phone) kramer says it\\'s up to the cat now. (to kramer) it\\'ll be on your conscience. \\n\\nkramer: oh? how do you figure? \\n\\njerry: (into phone) how do you figure? (to kramer) \\'cause you\\'re the one who left the door open. \\n\\nkramer: why was i in charge of closing the door? \\n\\njerry: (into phone) why was he in charge of closing the door? (irritated at the phone message relay, to kramer) \\'cause you came in after him! \\n\\nkramer: so! \\n\\njerry: (into phone) so! (to kramer - getting even more angry) so, the last person in should close the door! \\n\\nkramer: let me talk to him. \\n\\njerry: (to kramer) talk - call him from your house. (elaine enters. kramer leaves. to phone) he\\'s calling you now.. okay. (hangs up) \\n\\nelaine: ed\\'s downstairs. can i have the car keys? \\n\\njerry: no hello? \\n\\nelaine: got any asprin? (finds some) hello. now, lookit, you guarantee this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? no problems? \\n\\njerry: guarantee? ..hey, it\\'s a car. \\n\\nelaine: because if there\\'s even the slightest chance of any problem at all, i don\\'t want to take it - because if i don\\'t get this guy on a plane to seattle and out of my life, i\\'m gonna kill him, and everyone who tries to stop me. \\n\\njerry: (jokingly asking) so, did you have a nice week together? \\n\\nelaine: i heard a little ping in the car last time. what was that ping? \\n\\njerry: there\\'s no ping. why are you so wacky? \\n\\nelaine: jerry, you cannot imagine how much i hate this guy.. and he hasn\\'t even done anything! it\\'s the situation. he\\'s a wonderful guy, but i hate his guts! \\n\\njerry: so, you two been, uh.. \\n\\nelaien: no! i told him i\\'ve been having my period for the last five days! i\\'m sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.. but, i\\'ve only got fourteen hours to go. nothing can go wrong now. i think i\\'ve taken care of everything. i\\'ve confirmed the plane reservation. i\\'ve checked the weather.. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s your airport route? \\n\\nelaine: i\\'ve got it all mapped out - i\\'m taking the tunnel. \\n\\njerry: ..what about the van wyck? \\n\\nelaine: i spoke to a cab driver. for five bucks, he turned me on to the rockaway boulevard shortcut. \\n\\njerry: oooh. \\n\\nelaine: now, lookit, this plane leaves at 1015. we\\'re getting up at about eight. that gives us enough time, right? \\n\\njerry: you still using that old alarm clock? \\n\\nelaien: oh, no, no. i bought a new one today. it\\'s got everything - it\\'s got everything... if you oversleep more than ten minutes, a hand comes out and slaps you in the face. \\n\\n[setting: night club] \\n\\njerry: flying doesn\\'t make me nervous - driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you\\'re flying, when you\\'re getting on the plane, if you miss that plane, there\\'s no alternative. on the ground, you have options. you have buses, you have taxis, you have trains. but, when you\\'re taking a flight, if you miss it, that\\'s it. no airline goes, \"well, you missed the flight, we do have a cannon leaving in about ten minutes. would you be interested in that? it\\'s not a direct cannon, you have to change cannons after you land.\" (imitates cannon operator) \"i\\'m sorry, where you goin\\'? chicago? (cranks the cannon) oh, dallas? alright, wait a second.. (cranks cannon to dallas) dallas. that\\'s about dallas. texas, anyway. you should hit texas. are you ready? make sure you get out of the net immediately, because we shoot the luggage in right after you.\" \\n\\n[setting: elaine\\'s apartment] \\n\\n(elaine and ed are in bed. elaine awakes to find out that it\\'s 9: 15 - they overslept. she gets frantic) \\n\\nelaine: (trying to wake ed up) get up! the alarm clock didn\\'t go off! (shakes him) it\\'s 915! you\\'re gonna miss the plane! it\\'s 915! \\n\\ned: 915? \\n\\nelaine: yes! 915! \\n\\ned: (going back to sleep) we\\'ll never make it. i\\'ll leave tomarrow. \\n\\nelaine: tomarrow?! are you crazy? no, now, now! let\\'s go! (gets his suitcase from the closet, throws it on the bed, and frantically starts packing) you get dressed! get dressed! \\n\\ned: can i shower? \\n\\nelaine: shower?! are you out of your mind?! \\n\\ned: i gotta shower. i\\'ll feel dirty all day. \\n\\nelaine: forget the shower! the shower\\'s out. move it! put your clothes on! put your clothes on! (pulls out drawers of clothes, turning them over in the suitcase. he walks tward the door) where are you going? \\n\\ned: the kitchen. \\n\\nelaine: the kitchen?! \\n\\ned: i\\'ve got a bag of cashews in there. \\n\\nelaine: they\\'re not making it! let\\'s get your pants on! \\n\\ned: what\\'s the big deal if we don\\'t make it? i\\'ll just go tomarrow or the next day. \\n\\nelaine: no! you have your ticket! you have to go now! \\n\\ned: i\\'ll never make it. \\n\\nelaine: don\\'t say that! \\n\\ned: but it takes forty-five minutes to get there. that\\'ll only leave me five minutes to get to the plane. \\n\\nelaine: shut up and pack! \\n\\ned: and what if i don\\'t make the plane? you\\'ll have already left. then what will i do? \\n\\nelaine: you\\'re talking too much! \\n\\ned: where\\'s my sweater? \\n\\nelaine: what?! \\n\\ned: my brown sweater. \\n\\nelaine: what? what sweater? \\n\\ned: my brown sweater. \\n\\nelaine: you didn\\'t bring a brown sweater. \\n\\ned: i brought a brown sweater. \\n\\nelaine: here! here! you want a brown sweater?! (recahes into one of her drawers, and grabs a brown sweater, then packs it) you got a brown sweater! \\n\\ned: that\\'s not mine. i can\\'t take your sweater. \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s brown! (takes clothes still on the hangers, and dumps them into the suitcase) \\n\\ned: what are you doing?! \\n\\nelaine: no time for folding.. (looks around) i think that\\'s it. (zips up the suitcase) \\n\\ned: my shoes. you packed my shoes. \\n\\nelaine: shoes? shoes?! shoes?! shoes weren\\'t invented till the fourth century! people walked around for thousands of years without them! (puts her coat on over her nightie. he picks up his suitcase, she grabs it from him, then pushes him out of her way) i got this. let\\'s go! \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\njerry: anywhere in the city? \\n\\ngeorge: anywhere in the city - i\\'ll tell you the best public toilet. \\n\\njerry: okay.. fifty-fourth and sixth? \\n\\ngeorge: sperry rand building. 14th floor, morgan apparel. mention my name - she\\'ll give you the key. \\n\\njerry: alright.. sixty-fifth and tenth. \\n\\ngeorge: (scoffs) are you kidding? lincoln center. alice tully hall, the met. magnificent facilities. \\n\\nelaine: (slow, as if remember a dream) i never new i could drive like that. i was going faster than i\\'ve ever gone before, and yet, it all seemed to be happening in slow motion. i was seeing three and four moves ahead, weaving in and out of lanes like an olympic skier on a gold metal run. i knew i was challenging the very laws of physics. at queens boulevard, i took the shoulder. at jewel avenue, i used the median. i had it. i was there.. and then.. i hit the van wyck. they say no one\\'s ever beaten the van wyck, but gentlemen, i tell you this - i came as close as anyone ever has. and if it hadn\\'t been for that five-car-pile-up on rockaway boulevard, that numbskull would be on a plane for seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs. \\n\\nkramer: ..the busboy\\'s coming! the busboy\\'s coming! \\n\\ngeorge: the busboy\\'s coming? \\n\\njerry: you don\\'t mean here? \\n\\nkramer: yeah. i just buzzed him in. he\\'s on his way up.. \\n\\ngeorge: he\\'s coming up?! (moves to the door) i\\'ll check you out later. \\n\\njerry: where are you going? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m the one he wants! he\\'s coming to settle the score. \\n\\njerry: (trying to get george and kramer out) no. you three all know each other. there\\'s no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game. \\n\\nkramer: no, he\\'s not going to do anything. i guarantee it. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, the hell with it. let him kill me. i.. \\n\\nkramer: antonio. in here! \\n\\ngeorge: (nervous, his voice cracks) hey, antonio. how\\'s it going? \\n\\nantonio: three nights ago, a gas main beneath the restaurant exploded, killing five people in my section, including the busboy who replaced me. if i am not fired that night because of you and your thoughtless, stupid, insensitive remarks, it would have been me. you saved my life. (hugs him again) \\n\\ngeorge: (trying to be modest) ah, come on.. \\n\\nelaine: (into the intercom) yeah? \\n\\ned: it\\'s eddie. \\n\\nelaine: he\\'s coming up. (buzzes him in) he\\'s coming up.. \\n\\nantonio: and that very same night of the accident, while looking for pequita, i found a job in a restaurant where they pay me almost twice what i was making before - and when i returned to the apartment, pequita, perhaps frightened from the explosion, had miraculously returned. well, but now, i must go, for today i am starting my new and wonderful job. and i am very late. thank you, thank you, thank you all. (leaves) \\n\\ned: hey, watch were you\\'re going. you almost knocked my head off! \\n\\nantonio: hey, why don\\'t you watch where you\\'re going, okay? \\'cause you bumped into me! \\n\\ned: who do you think you\\'re talking to, pal? \\n\\nantonio: hey, get your hands off me! \\n\\ned: go to hell! \\n\\n[setting: coffee shop] \\n\\njerry: he\\'ll get another job. he\\'s a busboy! \\n\\ngeorge: it won\\'t for a while. at least not until after the cast comes off. \\n\\njerry: it was that fall down the stairs. that\\'s what did it. \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s not how it happened. it\\'s when he fell on him with his knee. \\n\\nelaine: oh, that was awful. poor antonio. (waiter hands elaine two bags of food to go) ..thanks. \\n\\ngeorge: so, much longer? \\n\\nelaine: till when - till he goes back to seattle, or till he can feed himself? \\n\\ngeorge: (not wanting to make elaine mad) i guess it\\'s not important. \\n\\nelaine: take care of yourselves. (leaves) \\n\\ngeorge: i should probably get going too. if i don\\'t feed pequita by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy. \\n\\njerry: yeah.. (takes a bite of his sandwich as the waiter starts cleaning off the table) how ya doing? \\n\\n[setting: night club] \\n\\njerry: first of all, i can\\'t believe that people actually do fight. people have fist fights in life. i can\\'t really believe that we have boxing either. it\\'s really kind of an amazing thing. to me, the problem with boxing is - you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument. why don\\'t they have the boxers come into the ring in little cars, drive around a bit, have a little accident? they get out, \"didn\\'t you see my signal?\" \"look at that fender!\" ..then you\\'d see a real fight. \\n\\njerry: evry-every time somebody recommends a doctor, he\\'s always the best. \"oh, is he good?\" \"oh, he\\'s the best. this guy\\'s the best.\" they can\\'t all be the best. there can\\'t be this many bests. someone\\'s graduating at the bottom of these classes, where are these doctors? is somewhere, someone saying to their friend, \"you should see my doctor, he\\'s the worst. oh yeah, he\\'s the worst, he\\'s the absolute worst there is. whatever you\\'ve got, it\\'ll be worse after you see him. no, he\\'s just, he\\'s a butcher. the man\\'s a butcher.\" and then there\\'s always that, \"make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me.\" why? what\\'s the difference? he\\'s a doctor. what is it, \"oh, you know bob! okay, i\\'ll give you the real medicine. and everybody else, i\\'m giving tic-tacs.\" \\n\\njulianna: ...and usually for lunch i\\'ll have a salad, and for dinner, i eat whatever i want. \\n\\njerry: what do you think the worst part of being blind is? \\n\\njulianna: excuse me? \\n\\njerry: you know, if you were blind, what do you think the worst part of it would be? \\n\\njulianna: i don\\'t know. \\n\\njerry: i think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food. how could you ever enjoy a meal like that? i\\'d constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue. \\n\\njulianna: well that\\'s how my five-year old eats. he\\'s a very picky eater. \\n\\njerry: you hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in pennsylvania? \\n\\njulianna: no. \\n\\njerry: he was at a carnival with his mother. she goes to get a hot dog, next thing you know she turns around, boom, he\\'s gone. \\n\\njulianna: oh. \\n\\njerry: imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that. (she starts the quick hand chops on his back) and these people are all over the place. you never know who\\'s crazy, i could be one of these people. \\n\\njulianna (visibly uncomfortable): have you seen any good movies? \\n\\njerry: who takes care of your boy during the day? \\n\\njulianna: we have a woman. why? \\n\\njerry: no no. i\\'m just saying. \\n\\njulianna: she had references. \\n\\njerry: oh i\\'m sure she did, i\\'m sure they\\'re impeccable. i\\'m talking about the ones that forge `em. \\n\\njerry: (about the massage)you know i think this is really helping. \\n\\njulianna: i don\\'t live near here, ya know! \\n\\njerry: so she\\'s giving me the massage and i\\'m just making conversation. \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t like to talk during a massage. \\n\\njerry: neither do i, but i do it for them. i figure they\\'re bored. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, i do that too. i feel guilty about getting the pleasure. i feel like i don\\'t deserve it so i talk. it stops me from enjoying it. there\\'s nothing to eat in here. \\n\\nelaine: oh! i forgot to tell you-- \\n\\njerry: i\\'m in the middle of a story. \\n\\nelaine: oh, okay, go ahead. \\n\\ngeorge: why don\\'t you ever go shopping? \\n\\njerry: well its not like it\\'s a really funny story or anything. \\n\\nelaine: what happened? \\n\\njerry: well so she mentioned that she had a son, and then for some reason, i launch into the story about the kid from pennsylvania who was abducted. \\n\\nelaine: oh, wasn\\'t that terrible? \\n\\njerry: yes, it was. \\n\\ngeorge: not even an apple. \\n\\nelaine: she doesn\\'t want to hear that, that was stupid. \\n\\njerry: i know it was stupid. \\n\\nelaine: really stupid. (she takes a big sip from her bottled water.) \\n\\njerry: hey, i just said it was stupid. \\n\\ngeorge: what about this leftover chinese food? \\n\\njerry: take it. \\n\\nelaine: i can\\'t believe you said that. \\n\\njerry: hey, would you stop it already? \\n\\nelaine: so, whatd she say? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid. \\n\\ngeorge: (he just took a bite of the chinese food ) this is terrible. what is this, ginger? i hate ginger. i can\\'t understand how anyone can eat ginger. (puts the container back in the refrigerator.) \\n\\nelaine: i have a good masseuse you could go to. \\n\\njerry: nah, she\\'s really good and she\\'s not just a masseuse, she\\'s a physical therapist. there\\'s a big difference. she uses the ultrasound, it\\'s a real medical procedure. in fact, if you get a doctor\\'s note, it\\'s covered by insurance. \\n\\ngeorge: physical therapy is covered by insurance? \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: you don\\'t have to pay for the massage? \\n\\njerry: not if you have a doctor\\'s note. \\n\\nelaine: so where do you get this note? \\n\\njerry: well i\\'ve never actually done it but if i really wanted to i could probably get one from my friend roy, the dentist. \\n\\ngeorge: right, your friend roy. \\n\\nelaine: what\\'s the name of this physical therapist? \\n\\njerry: i\\'ll tell you, but don\\'t ask her anything about her kid, she a little off. \\n\\ngeorge: and you don\\'t have to pay. \\n\\ngeorge: we have a, three-o\\'clock appointments. \\n\\nreceptionist: george and elaine, right? \\n\\nelaine: right. \\n\\nreceptionist: could you fill these out for me please? and um, elaine, you\\'ll be seeing julianna \\n\\nelaine: (quietly) ok. \\n\\nreceptionist: and george, you\\'ll be with raymond. \\n\\ngeorge: excuse me, did you say \\'raymond\\'? \\n\\nreceptionist: yes. \\n\\ngeorge: but, uh, raymond is a man. \\n\\nreceptionist: that\\'s right. \\n\\ngeorge: i can\\'t get a massage from a man. \\n\\nelaine: why not? \\n\\ngeorge: what, are you crazy? i can\\'t have a man touching me. switch with me. \\n\\nelaine: no, i don\\'t want the man either. \\n\\ngeorge: what\\'s the difference, you\\'re a woman. they\\'re supposed to be touching you. \\n\\nelaine: he\\'d just be touching your back. \\n\\ngeorge: he\\'d just be touching your back too. \\n\\nelaine: no, it could get sexual. \\n\\ngeorge: i know. that\\'s the point. if it\\'s gonna get sexual, it should get sexual with you. \\n\\nelaine: i wouldn\\'t be comfortable. \\n\\ngeorge: i would? what if something happens? \\n\\nelaine: what could happen? \\n\\ngeorge: what if it felt good? \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s supposed to feel good. \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t want it to feel good. \\n\\nelaine: then why get the massage? \\n\\ngeorge: exactly! \\n\\nraymond: george? \\n\\ngeorge: yes? \\n\\nraymond: i\\'m raymond. (with a big smile) \\n\\ngeorge: hello.(with not a big smile) \\n\\nraymond: are you ready? (smiling, he looks at elaine. she smiles back at him while looking all the way up there at the tall, handsome raymond.) \\n\\nraymond: and then julianna asked me if i wanted to join her here in the office. \\n\\ngeorge: really. \\n\\nraymond: use to be a flight attendant. \\n\\ngeorge: oh boy. \\n\\nraymond: ya know, why don\\'t ya, open those pants, it\\'s gonna be a lot easier that way. \\n\\nraymond: so what do you do? \\n\\ngeorge: what? \\n\\nraymond: i said, \\'what do you do?\\'. \\n\\ngeorge: i-i don\\'t know. \\n\\nraymond: you don\\'t know what you do? \\n\\ngeorge: nah. \\n\\nraymond: ohh-ho, come on. hey, you\\'re very tense. \\n\\ngeorge: hu, coffee. too much coffee (nervous laughter). \\n\\nraymond: okay, just take off those pants now, and i\\'ll work the hamstring. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, the hamstrings fine. \\n\\nraymond: but you wrote that it was tender. (holding the clip board) \\n\\ngeorge: i wrote. pfft, *i* wrote. \\n\\nraymond: i\\'ll check it out. (makes a notation on the form) \\n\\ngeorge: are you sure? \\n\\nraymond: yeah, take \\'em off. (continues writing) \\n\\nraymond: how did you hurt this? \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t know. \\n\\nraymond: you don\\'t know? \\n\\ngeorge: no. \\n\\nraymond: but you just told me-- \\n\\ngeorge: korea. \\n\\nraymond: you hurt it in korea? \\n\\ngeorge: what? \\n\\nraymond: the hamstring. \\n\\ngeorge: korea. \\n\\nraymond: how? \\n\\ngeorge: hamstring. \\n\\nraymond: how did you hurt the hamstring? \\n\\ngeorge: hotel. \\n\\nelaine: how\\'d it go? george? \\n\\njerry: no appointments at all? because my neck is still tight. what about thursday? and friday? oh boy. okay, thanks anyway. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s with you? \\n\\ngeorge: a... ah... \\n\\njerry: yes, a...? \\n\\ngeorge: a man gave me... \\n\\njerry: yes, a man gave you...? \\n\\ngeorge: a man gave me... a massage. hu, hu \\n\\njerry: so? \\n\\ngeorge: so he... had his hands and, uh, he was uh \\n\\njerry: he was what?! \\n\\ngeorge: he-he was uh touching and rubbing. (nervous laugh) \\n\\njerry: that\\'s a massage. \\n\\ngeorge: and then i took my pants off. \\n\\njerry: you took your pants off? \\n\\ngeorge: for my hamstring. \\n\\njerry: oh. \\n\\ngeorge: he got about uh, two inches from... there. \\n\\njerry: really? \\n\\ngeorge: i think it moved. \\n\\njerry: moved? \\n\\ngeorge: it may have moved, i don\\'t know. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m sure it didn\\'t move. \\n\\ngeorge: it moved! it was imperceptible but i-i felt it. \\n\\njerry: maybe it just wanted to change positions? you know, shift to the other side. \\n\\ngeorge: no, no. it wasn\\'t a shift, i\\'ve shifted, this was a move. \\n\\njerry: okay, so what if it moved? \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s the sign! the test; if a - if a man makes it move. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s not the test. contact is the test, if it moves, as a result of contact. \\n\\ngeorge: you think it\\'s contact? it has to be touched? \\n\\njerry: that\\'s what a gym teacher once told me. \\n\\nkramer: hey. \\n\\njerry: hey. \\n\\nkramer: i just saw joe dimaggio in dinky donuts. you know, i-i looked in there and there he was having coffee and a donut. \\n\\njerry: joe dimaggio? in dinky donuts? \\n\\nkramer: yeah. joe dimaggio. \\n\\njerry: no, i\\'m sorry, if joe dimaggio wants a donut, he goes to a fancy restaurant or a hotel. he\\'s not sitting in dinky donuts. \\n\\nkramer: well maybe he likes dinky donuts. \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t even like to sit next to a man on an airplane \\'cause our knees might touch. \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t see joe dimaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy smelly dinky donuts. \\n\\nkramer: why can\\'t joe dimaggio have a donut like everyone else? \\n\\njerry: he can have a donut, \\n\\nkramer: yeah. \\n\\njerry: but not at dinky. \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t even like to use urinals, always been a stall man. \\n\\nkramer: look i\\'m tellin-- (he does a double take and looks at george) i\\'m telling ya, that was joe dimaggio. \\n\\ngeorge: the guy slept with marilyn monroe, he\\'s in dinky donuts. what about this doctor\\'s note? let\\'s go see your friend roy. \\n\\njerry: i never said i\\'d do that. \\n\\ngeorge: what are you talking about, that\\'s seventy-five bucks! i\\'m not working, i can\\'t afford that. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know how i feel about it. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, what are you, like, a quaker now? \\n\\njerry: alright, alright. \\n\\nkramer: a stall man, huh? (small laugh) \\n\\ngeorge: all right -- (gets up to leave) \\n\\nkramer: wha-ha-a-at? (makes a gesture with his hand) \\n\\njerry: ...so we were just kinda wondering if it was possible for you to write us a note, and if you can\\'t, believe me, it\\'s fine. \\n\\ngeorge: he didn\\'t say he can\\'t. \\n\\njerry: i mean, if you feel funny about it, at all. \\n\\ngeorge: he doesn\\'t feel funny. \\n\\njerry: if he does. \\n\\ngeorge: do you feel funny? he didn\\'t say anything. \\n\\njerry: he feels funny. you don\\'t have to do this. \\n\\ngeorge: he knows that! \\n\\njerry: roy, should we go? is this a breach of our friendship? \\n\\ngeorge: oh, can you be any more dramatic? \\n\\nroy: don\\'t be ridiculous. (notices george looking at a poster on the wall) holyfield. he\\'s a good friend of one of my patients. he\\'s got a hell of a body, doesn\\'t he? \\n\\ngeorge: how would i know? \\n\\nroy: do you like him? \\n\\ngeorge: what do you mean, like him? \\n\\nroy: do you like him? \\n\\ngeorge: i mean he\\'s a good fighter and a nice guy but i don\\'t like him. \\n\\nroy: how come you don\\'t like him? \\n\\ngeorge: why should i? \\n\\njerry: what is the matter with you? \\n\\ngeorge: nothing, why? you think something\\'s wrong? am i different? \\n\\nroy: so, you want the notes? \\n\\njerry: you don\\'t have to, really. \\n\\nroy: nah nah, it\\'s ok. \\n\\njerry: we should probably get one for elaine, too, right george? (turns to george, who is staring intently at the holyfield poster) george? \\n\\njerry: well what about the week after? \\n\\njerry: no appointments at all? (motions to elaine to move over) \\n\\nelaine: what? (he bumps her with his butt to move over) \\n\\njerry: can i - can i at least just talk to her so i can apologize? forget it. (hangs up) i can\\'t believe this, i make one innocent comment, about some lunatic in pennsylvania and i\\'m cut off. this woman is insane. (looks at elaine for a moment) what\\'s with you? \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\njerry: well you were too close to me, i was all scrunched in there. \\n\\nelaine: hey, you scrunched me. i sat down here first. \\n\\nkramer: hey, i saw dimaggio in the donut shop again. \\n\\njerry: uh huh. \\n\\nkramer: yeah. \\n\\nelaine: joe dimaggio? \\n\\nkramer: joe dimaggio, you know this time i went in and sat down across from him and i really watched him. i studied, his every move. for example, he dunks. \\n\\nelaine: joe dimaggio dunks his donut?! \\n\\nkramer: that\\'s right. \\n\\njerry: see, now i know it\\'s not him. joe dimaggio could not be a dunker. \\n\\nkramer: oh, he\\'s a dunker. \\n\\nelaine: why couldn\\'t he be a dunker? \\n\\nkramer: and nothing diverts his attention. like, i\\'m uh, you know, i-i, like i\\'m sitting in there, you know. and, uh, i start banging on the table, you know, to uh, so that hell look up, you know, like i\\'m sitting there you know and uh, *bang* (slams the table) you know, *bang* he wouldn\\'t move. so then i start doing these yelping noises. like, *yip* (high pitched yelping noises) *yip*. no reaction because the guy is so focused, you see, he can just block out anything that\\'s going on around him. see, that\\'s how he played baseball. he dunks like he hits. \\n\\nelaine: so then what? \\n\\nkramer: well, then the waitress, she comes up and she tells me to shut up or they\\'re gonna throw me out. \\n\\nelaine: why didn\\'t you just call out his name? \\n\\njerry: what happened to you? \\n\\ngeorge: these kids called me a mary. \\n\\nelaine: a what? \\n\\ngeorge: i was jumping over a puddle, and for some reason i went like this.

\\n\\ngeorge: she put them in her pocketbook. i guess she took them with her. \\n\\nelaine: pocketbook or a handbag? \\n\\njerry: is that relevant? she took them. call her office. \\n\\ngeorge: give me the phone. (dials) yea, hi i would like to speak to patrice. ... what? ... oh really? ... oh, ok, thank you, ...

(exits) \\n\\njerry: not good \\n\\nkramer: yeah, it\\'s a windshield. \\n\\njerry: i can see that. what\\'s it for? \\n\\nkramer: i found it on the road. \\n\\njerry: yeah (to buzzer) \\n\\nelaine: (from intercom) i just finished working out are you busy? \\n\\njerry: come on up. \\n\\nkramer: can you believe somebody threw this out? you know i\\'m going to make a coffee table out of this and surprise tina. \\n\\njerry: wouldn\\'t it be invisible? i mean, what, are you going to just sense it\\'s in front of the couch? \\n\\nkramer: wow \\n\\nelaine: hell-oo \\n\\nkramer: hell-oo \\n\\njerry: what\\'s with you two? \\n\\nelaine: you haven\\'t told him? \\n\\njerry: tell me what? \\n\\nelaine: huh, go ahead, tell him. \\n\\nkramer: i, i saw her naked. \\n\\nelaine: he saw me naked. kramer, ... saw me naked. \\n\\nkramer: well, you know, ... it was an accident. \\n\\nelaine: who walks into a woman\\'s bedroom without knocking. i want to know! \\n\\nkramer: i thought it was a closet. \\n\\njerry: completely naked? \\n\\nkramer: completely naked. \\n\\nelaine: jerrryyy, how can i go on? \\n\\nkramer: all right. i\\'ll tell you what. if it\\'s going to make you feel any better you can see me naked. \\n\\nelaine: no thanks! \\n\\nkramer: no, i want you to see me naked. \\n\\nelaine: no, no no. \\n\\nkramer: no, i want to show you. \\n\\nelaine: no! jerry! jerry! \\n\\njerry: ok, just a second lets not lose our heads here. kramer you know you are always welcome in my home but as far as mr. johnson is concerned, that\\'s another story. \\n\\nelaine: what is this? \\n\\nkramer: well, it\\'s a windshield. it\\'s going to be your new coffee table. \\n\\nelaine: ah, i\\'m going to kill myself on that thiing. you can\\'t even see it. \\n\\njerry: you\\'ll sense it. \\n\\njerry: well, what happened? was she there? \\n\\ngeorge: no, no she wasn\\'t. \\n\\njerry: you didn\\'t get my papers? \\n\\ngeorge: no, i didn\\'t. \\n\\njerry: well, where is she? \\n\\ngeorge: a mental institution. \\n\\njerry: why is it so difficult, uncomfortable, to be naked. it\\'s because when you have clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments which people like to do ... you feel like you\\'re getting it together, yeah, yeah pretty good (pulling at lapels, pockets etc.) feeling good looking good but when you\\'re naked it\\'s like it\\'s so final you\\'re, well that\\'s it. (no movements) there\\'s nothing else i can do. that\\'s why i like to wear a belt when i\\'m naked. cause i feel it gives me something, i know i\\'m naked, but you know, (tugging and lifting belt) i like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be, wouldn\\'t that be the ultimate? to be naked and still be able to do this (hand in pocket) i think that would really help a lot. \\n\\njerry: a mental institution? \\n\\nkramer: you know what they do in there? did you see coocoo\\'s nest? they put those electrodes in your head. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s not really a mental institution. it\\'s more like a depression clinic. she went out to woodhaven and checked herself in. i\\'m, i\\'m sick over this. \\n\\nelaine: who told you this \\n\\ngeorge: her roommate. i\\'ve driven women to lesbianism before but never to a mental institution. \\n\\nkramer: my friend bob sacamano had shock treatments. but his synapses were so large, it had no effect. \\n\\njerry: you know i hate to raise a crass financial concern but was there any information as to the where abouts of my papers! \\n\\ngeorge: she put them in her pocket book. she probably took them out there with her. \\n\\njerry: so what now? \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t know. \\n\\njerry: can we go out there? \\n\\ngeorge: where? \\n\\njerry: woodhaven. \\n\\ngeorge: we could. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m very nervous about this. i\\'ve never spoken to a mental patient before. \\n\\njerry: my cousin douglas was in a place like this one time . he came over to my house for dinner. there was no soda and he went bezerk. he was screamin\\' \"where\\'s the pepsi, where\\'s the pepsi?\" \\n\\ngeorge: i should be in a place like this. i envy this woman. ya\\' get to wear slippers all day. friends visit. they pity you. pity is very underrated. i like it it\\'s good. plus they give you those word association tests. i love those. \\n\\njerry: that\\'d be great. there\\'s no wrong answer. \\n\\ngeorge: potato \\n\\njerry: tuberculosis \\n\\ngeorge: blanket \\n\\njerry: leroy \\n\\ngeorge: grass \\n\\njerry: tuberculosis \\n\\ngeorge: oh, boy. here she comes. \\n\\nelaine: oh, my god. \\n\\nelaine: kramer! \\n\\nkramer: hey. \\n\\nelaine: will you please put something on. \\n\\nkramer: listen uh, you want some leftovers? i made some african food. there\\'s, yambalas and uh, sambusa. \\n\\ntina: kramer, are you coming back to bed? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, yeah, i\\'ll be right there baby. \\n\\ntina: oh, hi elaine. (returns elaine\\'s ear rings) what did you think of the coffee table? \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s invisible. \\n\\nkramer: so, is everything cool? or what? \\n\\ntina: yeah, um, you seem little bit dysfunctional. \\n\\nelaine: well, \\n\\ntina: come on elaine. just tell us the truth. \\n\\nelaine: the truth!, you want the truth? \\n\\npatrice: who are you? \\n\\ngeorge: oh, this is my friend jerry. \\n\\npatrice: why are you talking like that? and what do you want? \\n\\njerry: want, want? what could i possibly want? uh, i just came because i, i heard so many nice things about you from george. \\n\\npatrice: george thinks i\\'m pretentious. \\n\\ngeorge: pretentious? who, who isn\\'t pretentious? ha, ha, if everyone who was pretentious was in a mental institution, ... uh, obviously this isn\\'t a mental institution. \\n\\npatrice: you\\'re just trying to take it all back because you\\'re feeling guilty i\\'m in here. \\n\\ngeorge: no, that\\'s not it at all. \\n\\npatrice: don\\'t lie george. \\n\\ngeorge : i\\'m not a lier! \\n\\ngeorge: uh, we\\'re cool. everything\\'s cool (to security attendent) \\n\\njerry: just chatting. friendly. \\n\\ngeorge: all righty, no reason for us to uh, raise our voices. \\n\\npatrice: i know what you said. you can\\'t change that. \\n\\ngeorge: what i said? i say stupid things all the time i can\\'t go two minutes without saying stupid things. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s one stupid thing after another. so let me ask you, when you come to one of these places, what do you bring your pocketbook? \\n\\ngeorge: you should be the one criticizing me. i, i\\'m lucky to even know someone like you. \\n\\npatrice: you mean that? \\n\\ngeorge: of course i mean that. i am incapable of guile. \\n\\njerry: he\\'s never guiled. you know some women keep a lot of important papers in their, uh, pocket books. like for example oh, someone else\\'s personal financial papers. \\n\\npatrice: papers? oh, jerry, you\\'re the jerome with the tax problem. you know after that day with george i got so cuckoo i threw out all your papers. so i\\'d love to help you but i\\'ll need the copies. \\n\\njerry: there are no copies. \\n\\npatrice: so are you saying you want to continue seeing me? \\n\\njerry: who makes copies? \\n\\nelaine: the truth is ... i think you make ... a very nice couple. \\n\\nkramer: oh, \\n\\ntina: kramer, \\n\\ntina: here kramer? \\n\\nkramer: no, lets go to the couch... \\n\\njerry: (on phone)yes, i\\'m trying to get a copy of a receipt for a computer that i bought there.... it was 1987 ... i remember i talked to a guy - he had like a maroon sport jacket - and he might have had a toupee - oh, it was a weave - ok uh, then i\\'ll come bye ok, bye. \\n\\njerry: anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street? i think i may have tracked down another receipt. \\n\\nelaine: i can\\'t. i have to go visit tina in the hospital. \\n\\njerry: george? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m going to a poetry reading with patrice first time poets, in a burnt out building, down by the docks, supposed to be good. \\n\\nkramer: hey, are you going to the hospital now? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, i suppose i am. \\n\\nkramer: all right, great, great uh, we\\'ll share a cab. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re going by 48th st. you can give me a ride. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, i\\'m getting in on that. \\n\\nelaine: you know you\\'re chippin\\' in. \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'re going that way anyway! \\n\\njerry: i was audited last year. at first i thought well, irs kinda sounds like toys r us maybe won\\'t be so bad. maybe they have a sense of fun about it, you know. but it\\'s it\\'s bad. it\\'s an ordeal. and they don\\'t do anything to keep your spirits up through the ordeal. i think they should take all your receipts and put them in one of those big lucite sweepstake drums and just kinda crank it around there. you know give me a feeling like you might win something. you know what i mean? then they can pull them out one by one and go \"oh, i\\'m sorry that\\'s another illegal deduction. but we do have some lovely parting gifts for you. jail!\" \\n\\n[setting: night club] \\n\\njerry: i have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. i don\\'t know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing suits from other centuries. my parents live in florida, and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear one of theirs. you know how that gets? \"you need trunks son? i\\'ve got trunks for you. you can wear my trunks.\" fathers don\\'t wear bathing suits, they wear trunks. it\\'s kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming. so i get in the water with in thing and it\\'s like floating around me somewhere. did you ever put on a bathing suit that you don\\'t even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? you bump into somebody you know \"no i\\'m parasailing, i\\'m waiting for the boat to come back.\" \\n\\n[setting: florida, evening, condo of jerry\\'s parents] \\n\\nhelen: (looking by the window) they were supposed to be here at 730. call the airlines again. \\n\\nmorty: (searching in a kitchen drawer) what happened to the scotch tape? who takes the scotch tape? nobody returns anything around here. \\n\\nhelen: oh i think that\\'s them! \\n\\nmorty: you what i\\'ll do next time? i\\'ll hide it so nobody can find it. \\n\\nall: hi, welcome, greetings, hugs, etc. \\n\\nmorty: welcome to florida! \\n\\nelaine: hi mr. seinfeld! (hug) \\n\\njerry: hey, there\\'s the old man! (hug) \\n\\nmorty: so, what took you so long? \\n\\njerry: ahh, we waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place. \\n\\nhelen: i don\\'t know why you had to rent a car. we would have picked you up. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s the difference? \\n\\nhelen: you could have used our car. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t wanna use your car. \\n\\nhelen: what\\'s wrong with our car? \\n\\njerry: nothing. it\\'s a fine car. what if you wanna use it? \\n\\nhelen: we don\\'t use it. \\n\\nmorty: what are you talking? we use it. \\n\\nhelen: if you were using it, we wouldn\\'t use it. \\n\\njerry: so what would you do? you\\'d hitch? \\n\\nhelen: how much is a rent-a-car? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know. 25 bucks a day. \\n\\nhelen: what? you\\'re crazy. \\n\\nmorty: plus the insurance. \\n\\njerry: oh, i didn\\'t get the insurance. \\n\\nmorty: how could you not get the insurance? \\n\\nhelen: we\\'ll pay for the car. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re not paying for it. \\n\\nhelen: morty. (asking him to back her. he doesn\\'t) \\n\\njerry: god it\\'s so hot in here. why don\\'t you put on the air conditioning? \\n\\nhelen: you don\\'t need the air conditioner. so, you have your speech all ready? \\n\\njerry: it\\'s not a speech. do i have to make a speech? \\n\\nhelen: of course, they\\'re giving a testimonial for your father. you could do your comic routines. \\n\\njerry: (ironically) oh yeah, that will go over real well with that crowd. \\n\\nelaine: (looking by the window) ooh, you have a lake? \\n\\njerry: the lake isn\\'t real. \\n\\nhelen: the lake is real. \\n\\nmorty: are you kidding? they built the lake. \\n\\nhelen: but it\\'s real. it\\'s water. \\n\\nhelen: where are you going with those? \\n\\njerry: i\\'m gonna put elaine\\'s stuff in here. \\n\\nhelen: don\\'t sleep in there. you can you use the bedroom. \\n\\nelaine: i can\\'t take your bedroom. \\n\\nhelen: i\\'m up at 6 o\\'clock in the morning. \\n\\nelaine: i can\\'t kick you out of your bed. \\n\\nhelen: we don\\'t even sleep. \\n\\njerry: ma. \\n\\nhelen: but this is sofa bed, you\\'ll be uncomfortable. \\n\\njerry: (to morty) what about you? \\n\\nmorty: why should i be comfortable? \\n\\njerry: (to helen) what about him? \\n\\nhelen: don\\'t worry, he\\'s comfortable. \\n\\nmorty: i\\'ll sleep standing up. i\\'ll be fine. \\n\\nhelen: will you stop? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, i\\'ll just stay in here. (goes in the guest room) \\n\\nhelen: jerry, (asking jerry to go in the kitchen so elaine won\\'t hear) jerry. you don\\'t have to stay on the couch on my account. the two of you could stay in there together. \\n\\njerry: na, that\\'s not such a good idea. \\n\\nhelen: well i tought that... \\n\\njerry: not now. she\\'s right inside. \\n\\nhelen: (quieter) what happened? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know. we decided we don\\'t really work as a couple. \\n\\nhelen: what does that mean? \\n\\njerry: well... \\n\\nmorty: (comes to the kitchen and with a loud voice) why are you whispering? \\n\\njerry: shh! nothing, nothing. \\n\\nhelen: elaine... \\n\\nmorty: (still loud) what about her? \\n\\njerry: (tries to explain to morty but elaine then comes out of the guest room to get more luggage, so he fakes a conversation) ...but you know, look at the sun-dried tomatoes. where were they five years ago? it just goes to show you. you never know what... huh (waiting for elaine to go back in the guest room) you know... huh... what could happen to a vegetable. it could just take right off at any time. (morty finally gets it. so jerry goes on quieter) we\\'ve tried all kind of arrangements, but we can\\'t seem to be friends when we sleep together. \\n\\nmorty: (morty goes on louder! did he ever whisper in any episode? -) why do you need more friends? you\\'ve got plenty of friends. \\n\\nhelen: he\\'s an idealist. \\n\\nmorty: what the hell are you looking for? \\n\\njerry: i\\'m looking. that\\'s the point. i like looking. \\n\\nhelen: he likes looking. \\n\\nmorty: so look. \\n\\nhelen: but how long can you look? \\n\\njerry: i\\'m going for the record. \\n\\nhelen: you know your father wouldn\\'t say so but he\\'s really glad you came. \\n\\njerry: oh, come on. \\n\\nhelen: this is a big thing for him. outgoing president of the condo association. \\n\\n(knock on door: this is jack and doris, neigboors) \\n\\nmorty: aha! \\n\\ndoris: so they arrived safely. \\n\\nmorty: (to jerry) you remember jack and doris? \\n\\njerry: nice to see you. this is elaine. \\n\\nelaine: hi. nice to meet you. \\n\\njack: so jerry, you came all the way down here for this? \\n\\nelaine: and scuba diving. \\n\\nhelen: scuba diving? who\\'s going scuba diving? \\n\\njerry: we\\'re going scuba diving. we\\'ll be back in time. \\n\\nhelen: what do you have to go scuba diving for? \\n\\njerry: for fun. \\n\\nhelen: for fun? \\n\\nmorty: jack have some spong cake. \\n\\njack: no. thanks, no. \\n\\nmorty: jack is emceeing tomorrow. he\\'s in charge of the whole thing. \\n\\njack: so jerry, your mother told me you\\'re gonna do one your little comedy skits tomorrow? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t think so. \\n\\njack: no? listen morty you wanna settle up for last night? (morty nods) all right. i owe you 19.45$ (he gets his checks book and a pen from his pocket). \\n\\nmorty: what did you have? you had the minute steak? \\n\\njack: yeah. \\n\\nmorty: did you have a coke or what? \\n\\njack: i did not have a coke. \\n\\nmorty: somebody had a coke. \\n\\nhelen: oh i had a coke. \\n\\ndoris: and i had the scampi. \\n\\njack: so that\\'s 17.10$ and the tax and the tip. \\n\\nmorty: all right. make it 20 bucks. \\n\\njack: it\\'s 19.45$, morty. (he gives him the check) \\n\\nmorty: 19.45$ ? \\n\\njack: see? you know your father. he can\\'t get a write to the penny, but that\\'s why he was such a good president. \\n\\njerry: what kind of pen is that? \\n\\njack: this pen? \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\njack: this is an astronaut pen. it writes upside down. they use this in space. \\n\\njerry: wow! that\\'s the astronaut pen. i heard about that. where did you get it? \\n\\njack: oh it was a gift. \\n\\njerry: cause sometimes i write in bed and i have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen work. \\n\\njack: take the pen. \\n\\njerry: oh no. \\n\\njack: go ahead. \\n\\njerry: i couldn\\'t \\n\\njack: come on, take the pen! \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t take it. \\n\\njack: do me a personal favor! \\n\\njerry: no, i\\'m not... \\n\\njack: take the pen! \\n\\njerry: i cannot take it! \\n\\njack: take the pen! \\n\\njerry: are you sure? \\n\\njack: positive! take the pen! \\n\\njerry: o.k. thank you very much. thank you. gee, boy! \\n\\nhelen: jack, what are you doing? \\n\\njack: stop it! \\n\\ndoris: jack, we should go. (they go to the door) it was nice meeting you. \\n\\nelaine: mmm, nice to meet you. \\n\\njerry: thanks again. \\n\\njack: come on! \\n\\ndoris: (to morty) she\\'s adorable. (they leave) \\n\\nhelen: (as soon as the door\\'s closed) what did you take his pen for? \\n\\njerry: what he gave it to me. \\n\\nhelen: you didn\\'t have to take it. \\n\\nmorty: oh my god! she\\'s gotta make a big deal out of everything. \\n\\njerry: he offered it to me. \\n\\nhelen: because you made such a big fuss about it. \\n\\njerry: i liked it. should i have said i didn\\'t like it? \\n\\nhelen: you shouldn\\'t have said anything. what did you expect him to do? (the camera shows elaine shaking her head at their dispute) \\n\\njerry: he could have said \"thank you, i like it too\" and put it back in his pocket. \\n\\nhelen: he loves that pen. \\n\\nmorty: oh come on! \\n\\nhelen: he talks about it all the time. every time he takes it out he goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how the astronauts use it. \\n\\njerry: if he likes it so much, he never should have offered it. \\n\\nhelen: he didn\\'t think you\\'d accpet. \\n\\njerry: well, he was wrong. \\n\\nhelen: i know his wife. she has some mouth on her. she\\'ll tell everyone in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. they\\'re talking about it right now. (again we see elaine smiling at their argument) \\n\\njerry: so you want me to return it? \\n\\nhelen: yes. \\n\\nmorty: he\\'s not gonna return the pen. that\\'s ridiculous. \\n\\njerry: hey i don\\'t even want the pen now! \\n\\nmorty: jack can afford to give away a pen with all his money. believe me. he gives me a check for 19.45. he didn\\'t have a coke. ho, ho, ho! \\n\\nelaine: here, let me see it. (she takes a pad to try the pen) hey, it writes upside down. \\n\\n[setting: condo\\'s guest room] \\n\\nelaine: come in. \\n\\njerry: are you o.k. in here? \\n\\nelaine: why is it so hot in here? how can they sleep like this? \\n\\njerry: it\\'s only for three days. today\\'s over and we have tommorow. we leave on sunday. it\\'s one day, really. \\n\\nelaine: oh man. what is with this bar? it\\'s right in my back. it\\'s killing me. \\n\\njerry: oh you wanna switch? i\\'m sleeping on a love seat. i\\'ve got my feet up in the air like i\\'m in a space capsule. \\n\\nelaine: i am never gonna fall asleep. \\n\\njerry: oh, no don\\'t say that. you\\'ll jinx me. \\n\\nelaine: how can they not put the air conditioning on? \\n\\njerry: they\\'re nuts with temperature. \\n\\nelaine: this bar is right in my back! it\\'s making a dent. \\n\\njerry: how about that guy writing a check for 19.45? \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m sweating here. i\\'m in bed, sweating. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s one day. half a day, really. i mean you substract showers and meals, it\\'s like twenty minutes. it will go by like that. (snapping his fingers) \\n\\n[setting: condo, morning] \\n\\nmorty: stay on 95 south to biscayne boulevard. then you make a left turn. put you blinker on immediatly, there\\'s an abutment there. then you\\'re gonna merge over very quickly, but stay on biscayne. don\\'t get off biscayne. you understand me? \\n\\njerry: stay on biscayne. \\n\\nhelen: you\\'re going underwater? \\n\\njerry: yes. generally that\\'s where scuba diving is done. \\n\\nhelen: what do you have to go underwater for? what\\'s down there that\\'s so special? \\n\\njerry: what\\'s so special up here? \\n\\nelaine: oh! \\n\\nhelen: what\\'s the matter? \\n\\nelaine: my back. \\n\\nhelen: what happened? \\n\\nelaine: that... that bed. the bar was right in my back. \\n\\nhelen: (to jerry) i told you to let us sleep in there. \\n\\njerry: then you would be hunched over. \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t even know if i can go scuba diving. \\n\\njerry: you can\\'t go? \\n\\nhelen: so stay home. \\n\\nelaine: you can go. \\n\\njerry: without you? that\\'s the whole reason you came down here. \\n\\nhelen: don\\'t go. \\n\\njerry: you sure? \\n\\nmorty: maybe you should see a doctor. \\n\\njerry: we\\'ll stay in a hotel tonight. \\n\\nelaine: (whispering to jerry) yes! \\n\\nhelen: no, we\\'ll stay in there. \\n\\njerry: why don\\'t you get a new sofa? \\n\\nmorty: nobody uses it. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m buying you a new sofa. \\n\\nhelen: oh jerry, don\\'t talk crazy. \\n\\nelaine: mrs seinfeld, please. i am begging you. put the air conditioner on. \\n\\nhelen: you\\'re hot? \\n\\nelaine: i\\'ve lost 6 pounds. \\n\\nhelen: i don\\'t even know how to work it. \\n\\nmorty: i keep telling her it\\'s like an oven in here. \\n\\nevelyn: is everybody up? \\n\\njerry: hi. how are you? \\n\\nevelyn: hello jerry. \\n\\njerry: evelyn, this is elaine. \\n\\nelaine: (with pain) hi evelyn. \\n\\nevelyn: jerry you got thin. \\n\\njerry: too thin? \\n\\nhelen: oh stop worrying so much about how you look. \\n\\nevelyn: so where\\'s the new pen? (everybody\\'s surprised by this question) \\n\\njerry: (jerry scratches his head and acts like he\\'s not sure what she\\'s talking about) what? \\n\\nevelyn: the pen. the one jack klompus gave you. \\n\\nhelen: how did you know that? \\n\\nevelyn: blanche told me. \\n\\nhelen: blanche? \\n\\nevelyn: that\\'s some good pen. it writes upside down. \\n\\nelaine: the astronauts use them. \\n\\nhelen: what did blanche say? \\n\\nevelyn: i don\\'t know. she said jerry wanted the pen. \\n\\njerry: i never really wanted the pen. \\n\\nmorty: he gave him the pen. \\n\\nhelen: morty. \\n\\nevelyn: why you don\\'t like the pen? \\n\\njerry: no, no, i... \\n\\nevelyn: cause if you don\\'t like it, give it back to him. \\n\\nhelen: is that what she said? \\n\\nevelyn: who? \\n\\nhelen: blanche. \\n\\nevelyn: what are you talking about? \\n\\nhelen: hello? oh hello gussy. what? jerry wouldn\\'t do that. jack gave it to him. all he said was he liked it. i mean nobody put a gun to his head. (to jerry) you\\'re giving him back that pen. (she continues the discussion with gussy but we don\\'t hear it.) \\n\\nelaine: somebody please-- the air conditioner! \\n\\nmorty: (morty gets up) oh! i forgot all about it. \\n\\njerry: all i said was \"i like the pen\". \\n\\nmorty: how the hell do you work this thing? \\n\\n[setting: still the condo, later] \\n\\nhelen: maybe you shouldn\\'t go tonight. \\n\\nelaine: no no, i wanna go. \\n\\nhelen: but your back hurts. \\n\\nmorty: maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would help. \\n\\nelaine: oh, oh, o.k. (helen holds her sweater tight against herself) you can turn down the air conditioning if you want. \\n\\nhelen: no. i\\'m fine. \\n\\nelaine: you\\'re not too cold? \\n\\nhelen: no. \\n\\njerry: don\\'t be alarmed. \\n\\nmorty: oh my god! what the hell happened to you? \\n\\njerry: i\\'m o.k. my capillaries burst. \\n\\nhelen: your capillaries? do you know what you look like? \\n\\njerry: (to elaine on the floor) how are you doing? \\n\\nelaine: having a good time! \\n\\njerry: is it my imagination or is it freezing in here? \\n\\nhelen: what happened to your eyes? \\n\\njerry: well i started to go under... \\n\\nhelen: with the instructor? \\n\\njerry: yeah, and i got about ten feet down and i felt this tremendous pressure on my mask. like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets. \\n\\nhelen: i told you... \\n\\njack: excuse me. (to helen) doris would like to borrow red your pocketbook to go with her shoes. (to elaine on the floor) the shoes have to match the pocketbook. (to the others) what\\'s she doing? yoga? \\n\\nelaine: my back hurts. \\n\\njack: morty you gotta hurry up. get ready. \\n\\nmorty: we got plenty of time. \\n\\njack: (to jerry) what happened to you? \\n\\njerry: i got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool. \\n\\nhelen: it\\'s from scuba diving. \\n\\njack: what\\'s there to see underwater? \\n\\n(helen turns to jerry and makes a face like: give him back the pen) \\n\\njerry: listen m. klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but i don\\'t really need it. \\n\\njack: you what? \\n\\njerry: i mean it\\'s a terrific pen, but i think you should keep it. (he hands the pen to jack) \\n\\njack: well i mean... \\n\\njerry: take it. \\n\\njack: all right! (he smiles and take it) \\n\\nmorty: you know jack, you\\'ve got a hell of a nerve taking that kid\\'s pen. \\n\\njack: whose pen? \\n\\nmorty: his pen. \\n\\njack: this happens to be my pen. \\n\\nmorty: you didn\\'t give it to him. \\n\\njack: what are you talking about? he pratically begged me for it. \\n\\nmorty: where do you come off with this crap? \\n\\njack: listen, do you think i take everything everybody offers me? you offered me sponge cake yesterday. did i take it? \\n\\nmorty: you said you didn\\'t want it! \\n\\njack: of course i wanted it! i love sponge cake! \\n\\nmorty: then who the hell said you couldn\\'t have any? i mean what the hell do i care whether you have sponge cake? \\n\\njack: because i saw the look on your face last week when i took the scotch tape! \\n\\nmorty: ahh! ahh! so you got the scotch tape! i\\'ve been looking all over for it! \\n\\njack: don\\'t worry about it! i\\'ll give it back! \\n\\nmorty: i don\\'t want it! \\n\\njack: i don\\'t want it! \\n\\nmorty: you know jack, do me a favor will you? take the pen and the scotch tape, and get the hell out of here! \\n\\njack: listen do you think i give a damn? \\n\\nmorty: aah! (jack leaves) the nerve of that guy! taking back that pen. well that\\'s it for them. \\n\\njerry: what is going on in this community! are you people aware of what\\'s happening? what is driving you to this behavior? is it the humudity? is it the muzak? is it the white shoes? \\n\\nhelen: i have no use for either one of them. i don\\'t even want them there tonight. (she still has the pocketbook in her hands) \\n\\njerry: isn\\'t he supposed to be the emcee? \\n\\nmorty: yeah, he\\'s supposed to be the emcee. \\n\\njerry: well. this should be a very interesting evening. \\n\\nelaine: (still on the floor) uh... what about those muscle relaxers? \\n\\n[setting: reception room, evening] \\n\\nphotographer: say astronaut. \\n\\nelaine: say what? (laughing) say what? \\n\\njerry: (jerry brings her back) you took too many of those pills. \\n\\nmorty: astronaut? \\n\\nhelen: say it. \\n\\njerry, morty and helen: astronaut! \\n\\nelaine: (still laughing, she says it just as the picture is taking) astro...naut! \\n\\nmorty: good. o.k. (the photographer walks away) what about last year when i took him to the hospital every day? did he ever say thank you? \\n\\njerry: oh god. (foreseeing an arm\\'s grabbing as he sees uncle leo entering with his wife stella) \\n\\njerry: (to leo) uncle leo. \\n\\nleo: hello! \\n\\nstella: morty are you nervous? \\n\\nmorty: what nervous? \\n\\nleo: (to jerry while he\\'s grabbing his arm as usual) what\\'s with the sunglasses? who are you? van johnson? \\n\\njerry: i\\'ve got a black eye. \\n\\nstella: (to elaine in a childish voice) hello. \\n\\njerry: oh uh, elaine, this is my aunt stella. \\n\\nhelen: (shouting as she imitates marlon brando) stella! stella! \\n\\njerry: (to stella) her back hurts. \\n\\nstella: humm... we saw you on \"the tonight show\" last week. \\n\\nleo: i thought johnny was very rude to you. he didn\\'t even let you talk. \\n\\njerry: no, no. \\n\\nleo: you need some new material. i\\'ve heard you do that dog routine three times already. \\n\\nelaine: (still with her imitation, shouting even louder) stella! stella! \\n\\nleo: listen, you should get your cousin jeffrey to write some material for you. \\n\\nmorty: what are you talking? jeffrey works for the parks department! \\n\\nleo: you should read the letters he\\'s written. he\\'s funnier than the whole bunch of you! (jack enters with doris) oh, here\\'s jack. we should sit down. \\n\\nstella: (to helen on a sarcastic tone of voice) this better be good. i\\'m missing \"golden girls\" for this. \\n\\nhelen: (laughing hypocritically till stella walks away) i hate her like poison. \\n\\n(a few minutes later, the ceremony is about to begin. someone in the crowd yells: \"hey jack let\\'s get started!\" everyone applause and we see, from left to right, all sitting on the same side of a long table, facing the public stella, leo, elaine, jerry, helen, morty, jack at the microphone, doris, and four other people.) \\n\\njack: (on the microphone) ladies and gentlemen, as you know, every year, phase two of the pines of mark gables honors the previous year president. and this year we are honoring morty seinfeld (the crowd applause and someone yells morty!) a man who slept more hours on the job than ronald reagan. \\n\\nmorty: (to helen) slept on the job? (she shushed him) \\n\\njack: being president of the condo is not easy. it requires hard work, dedication, and commitment, and unfortunately he possesses none of these qualities. (everyone laugh except jerry, helen, and morty. even elaine who\\'s still druggy) \\n\\nhelen: (morty complains again to helen) he\\'s joking. \\n\\njack: his administration did excel in one department the hiring of incompetents. \\n\\nmorty: (to jack, loud) that\\'s what you say. \\n\\njack: but we do owe him a debt of gratitude because by not fixing the crack in the sidewalk, he put mrs ziven out of commission for a few weeks. (morty is now the only one not laughing) \\n\\nmorty: (loud) tell them when you took my son\\'s pen back. tell them about that! (he gets up) \\n\\njerry: dad! \\n\\nmorty: (to the crowd) he gave my son a pen, and then he takes it back. tell them about that! \\n\\njack: he gave it to me! \\n\\nmorty: come on. that\\'s enough, sit down! \\n\\njack: i\\'m not sitting down! \\n\\njack: ow! you broke my dental plate! (jack is touching his dental plate while morty reaches in jack\\'s pocket to get the pen) doris! he broke my dental plate. you son-of-a-bitch! i\\'m gonna sue you. (he leaves the table and morty follows him and continue arguing with him. jerry now have the microphone in his hands and the crowd begins to think the ceremony is over.) \\n\\nhelen: jerry, do your act. \\n\\njerry: (in the microphone, but to helen) i can\\'t. nobody\\'s even listening. \\n\\nhelen: they\\'re all gonna leave. \\n\\njerry: (to himself) oh god! (in the microphone) huh... hey! how you folks doing tonight? (everybody in the crowd is talking over jerry) \\n\\nman in the crowd: who are you? \\n\\njerry: (still with his sunglasses) have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes? \\n\\nwoman in the crowd: (to heckle jerry) not my harry. he flies first class. \\n\\njerry: who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut? \\n\\nman in the crowd: i\\'d rather have a bottle of scotch! \\n\\nhelen: (to jerry) do the dog routine. \\n\\njerry: all i said was i liked the pen! \\n\\nelaine: (wakes up and yells very loud) stella! \\n\\n[setting: condo, morning] \\n\\nchiropractor: you could aggravate it. i wouldn\\'t go anywhere for at least five days. \\n\\nelaine: five days? you want me to stay here for five more days? \\n\\njerry: there must be some mistake. \\n\\nchiropractor: i\\'m afraid not. \\n\\nelaine: (discouraged) five days. here. \\n\\nhelen: (to jerry, happily) so we have you for five more days! \\n\\njerry: (to elaine) well there\\'s really no point in me staying. i mean you just gonna be... \\n\\nelaine: excuse me? \\n\\njerry: nothing. \\n\\nevelyn: good morning. \\n\\njerry: hi evelyn. \\n\\nevelyn: (to helen) has morty decided on a lawyer yet? \\n\\nhelen: i don\\'t think so. \\n\\nevelyn: because my nephew larry could do it. he\\'s a brilliant lawyer. he says jack has no case. \\n\\nhelen: well i\\'ll ask him when he gets up. \\n\\nevelyn: oh, and i spoke to arnold. and he says that according to the bylaws of the condo constitution, they need six votes to throw you out for unruly behavior. not five. doctor chernov is the one you\\'ll have to suck up to. \\n\\nmorty: aw! aw! oh my back! oh my back! it\\'s that bar. who the hell could sleep on that thing? \\n\\nhelen: i was very comfortable. \\n\\nevelyn: morty, arnold says they need six votes to throw you out. \\n\\nhelen: it\\'s in the constitution. \\n\\nmorty: (to the chiro) who are you? \\n\\nchiropractor: i\\'m a chiropractor. \\n\\nmorty: what are you kidding me? \\n\\nelaine: (to jerry) five more days? \\n\\njerry: well today\\'s almost over. and weekdays always go by fast. friday we\\'re leaving. it\\'s like two days really. it\\'s like a cup of coffee. it will go by like that. (snapping his fingers) \\n\\n[setting: night club, closing monologue] \\n\\njerry: is florida not hot and muggy enough for these people? they love heat. i mean if they ever decide to land men on the sun, i think these old retired guys would be the only ones that will be able to handle it. they\\'ll just sit there on the sun, on the redwood benches, washcloth on the head going \"close the door, you\\'re letting all the heat off the sun. i\\'m trying to get a sweat going.\" \\n\\njerry: so i\\'m on the plane, we left late. pilot says we\\'re going to be making up some time in the air. i thought, well isn\\'t that interesting. we\\'ll just make up time. that\\'s why you have to reset your watch when you land. of course, when they say they\\'re making up time, obviously they\\'re increasing the speed of the aircraft. now, my question is if you can go faster, why don\\'t you just go as fast as you can all the time? c\\'mon, there\\'s no cops up here, nail it. give it some gas! we\\'re flying! \\n\\ngavin: travelling, of course, is the best education. do you know last year i was in over forty, forty-five countries, and i would have gone to more but i had just got a puppy, and he was too young to take with me. but now i won\\'t travel without him. \\n\\njerry: is he on the plane now? \\n\\ngavin: oh yes. yes, he\\'s in the, he\\'s in the baggage compartment. i don\\'t know why they won\\'t let him sit up here with me. he\\'s a lot better behaved than most of the dregs you find onboard here. do you, do you have any pets? \\n\\njerry: uh, just my next door neighbor. \\n\\ngavin: you\\'re missing out on a relationship that could enrich your life in ways that you never could have thought possible. \\n\\njerry: howbout picking up their, you know. you find that enriching? \\n\\njerry: what\\'s the matter? \\n\\ngavin: oh, i\\'m feeling a bit queasy. \\n\\nattendant #1: sir, we\\'re gonna make an emergency landing in chicago and get you to a hospital. \\n\\ngavin: my dog. what about my dog? \\n\\nattendant #1: uh, you have a dog? \\n\\nattendant #2: do you know anyone on the plane, mr. palone? \\n\\ngavin: jerry? \\n\\njerry: huh? how you feeling? \\n\\ngavin: would you take care of farfel? \\n\\njerry: farfel? \\n\\nattendant #2: it\\'s his dog. we\\'re landing in chicago to get him to a hospital, could you take his dog to new york? \\n\\njerry: the dog? the dog?? \\n\\ngavin: i\\'m sure it\\'s only for a day or two. \\n\\njerry: but, you know, what if, you know? \\n\\ngavin: give me your address and phone number, i\\'ll call you. \\n\\njerry: the dog? \\n\\njerry: let go, farfel! let go, gimme that! gimme the sneaker you stupid idiot! shut up! (to elaine) so what would you do? \\n\\nelaine: well it\\'s only been three days, i\\'m sure he\\'s gonna call. \\n\\njerry (to farfel): stop it! shut uuuuuup!!! (to elaine) do you believe this? do you believe what i\\'m dealing with here, i\\'ve got a wild animal in the house! he\\'s deranged, maybe he\\'s got rabies. i can get lockjaw. \\n\\nelaine: if only. \\n\\njerry: look at this place. he\\'s going everywhere, i can\\'t go out of the house at night. i haven\\'t performed in three days. this\\'ll be my first night out of the house since i got back. \\n\\nelaine: hey, when you walk him, do ya... \\n\\njerry: do i what? \\n\\nelaine: do you pick it up? \\n\\njerry: yes, i pick it up. \\n\\nelaine: you pick it up?!? \\n\\njerry: well you have to. \\n\\nelaine: oh, boy would i love to see that. \\n\\njerry: shut up!! shut up farfel, stop it! (to elaine) i don\\'t know what to do. i mean what if i take it to the pound then the guy shows up? \\n\\nelaine: maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is. \\n\\njerry: no, i tried. they don\\'t know anything. (notices elaine making egg creams) you gotta put the syrup in first. \\n\\nelaine: no, milk. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m telling you the guy\\'s a drunk, he\\'s probably on a bender. \\n\\nelaine: what is a bender anyhow? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know, they drink and they bend things at the bar. \\n\\nelaine: i can\\'t believe he hasn\\'t called. \\n\\njerry: two hundred seats on a plane, i gotta wind up next to yukon jack and his dog cujo. shut up! one more day and you are pound bound! \\n\\nkramer: sorry, i can\\'t watch the dog tonight. \\n\\njerry: why? \\n\\nelaine: we\\'re going to the movies, we\\'re gonna see prognosis negative. \\n\\nkramer: i can\\'t, i gotta get this ellen out of my life. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re breaking up? \\n\\nkramer: oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. i can\\'t wait to do it. you know how there\\'s some people you worry about whether you\\'re going to hurt their feelings? with her, i\\'m looking forward to it. i\\'d like to get it on video, watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. oh ho, yeah. \\n\\nelaine: kramer, i don\\'t know how you lasted as long as you did. \\n\\nkramer: woah, you didn\\'t like her? \\n\\nelaine: if you could see her personality it would be like one of the elephant man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps. \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t believe someone hasn\\'t killed her yet. \\n\\nkramer: how come you never said anything? \\n\\njerry: well you can\\'t tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after they stop seeing them. \\n\\nkramer: i tell you. \\n\\njerry: you. i\\'m talking about people. \\n\\nelaine: are we still going to the movies tonight? \\n\\njerry: no, i can\\'t i gotta watch farfel, you and george can go without me. \\n\\nelaine: just me and george? \\n\\njerry: sure. \\n\\nelaine: but we need you. \\n\\njerry: what do you need me for? \\n\\nelaine: because... yeah? \\n\\ngeorge: prognosis negative! (in a funny voice) \\n\\nelaine: because i relate to george through you, we\\'re like friends-in-law. besides, you said we were gonna see prognosis negative together. can\\'t you just put some newspapers down or something? \\n\\njerry: no, i can\\'t trust him, he gets insane. i won\\'t enjoy myself. that\\'s right, farfel, i\\'m talking about you! \\n\\nelaine: just me and george alone? \\n\\ngeorge: let\\'s go, people, let\\'s go! it\\'s prognosis negative time, wa ha ha ha!!! \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t go. \\n\\ngeorge: can\\'t go, why not? \\n\\njerry: because i have to watch idiot farfel. \\n\\ngeorge: i thought kramer was watching. \\n\\njerry: he\\'s breaking up with his girlfriend tonight. \\n\\ngeorge: well so what\\'s the problem, you just put some newspaper down. \\n\\njerry: no, i don\\'t want that smell in the house. \\n\\ngeorge: you spritz a little lysol on it. \\n\\njerry: no, it\\'s like bo and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of strange mutant funk. \\n\\ngeorge: so we\\'re not going? \\n\\njerry: nah. you two go. \\n\\ngeorge: oh. you still wanna go? \\n\\nelaine: do, do you? \\n\\ngeorge: if you want. \\n\\nelaine: it,s, it\\'s up to you. \\n\\njerry: go ahead. \\n\\nelaine: well, it\\'s, i really wanted to see prognosis negative with jerry, uh, you wanna see ponce de leon? \\n\\ngeorge: ponce de leon? okay. (to jerry) you sure you don\\'t wanna go? \\n\\njerry: i want to but i can\\'t. \\n\\nelaine: oh! i tell you what. how about if i come back here first and i clean everything up and i open up the windows and if you\\'re still not satisfied we can switch apartments for the night. \\n\\njerry: no. \\n\\ngeorge: what about this-- \\n\\njerry: forget it. go ahead, you\\'ll have a good time. \\n\\nelaine: i know, it\\'s not that. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s just we want you to go. \\n\\njerry: well, thank you very much. i\\'m telling you, one more day stinkbreath! \\n\\njerry: on my block, a lot of ah, people walk their dogs, and i always see them walking along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest function of human life. if aliens are watching this through telescopes, they\\'re gonna think the dogs are the leaders. if you see two life forms, one of them\\'s making a poop, the other one\\'s carrying it for him, who would you assume was in charge? \\n\\ngeorge: so how long did you live there? \\n\\nelaine: about three years. \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s pretty long. \\n\\nelaine: hmm. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s not that long, really. \\n\\nelaine: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: and then you came here. \\n\\nelaine: yeah. so i\\'ve been here about six years. \\n\\ngeorge (counting on his fingers): eighty-six, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, ninety, ninety-one... yup. \\n\\njerry: bad dog! bad dog! you go outside! outside!! what do you want from me? tell me! money, you want money? i\\'ll give you money, how much?! \\n\\nkramer: i must have been out of my mind. look at you. why don\\'t you do something with your life? sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to society. you\\'re just taking up space. how could i be with someone like you? wouldn\\'t respect myself. \\n\\ngeorge: i like herbal tea. \\n\\ngeorge: chamomile\\'s good. lemon lift. almond pleasure. \\n\\nelaine: jerry likes morning thunder. \\n\\ngeorge: jerry drinks morning thunder? \\n\\nelaine: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: morning thunder has caffeine in it, jerry doesn\\'t drink caffeine. \\n\\nelaine: jerry doesn\\'t know morning thunder has caffeine in it. \\n\\ngeorge: you don\\'t tell him? \\n\\nelaine (laughing): no. and you should see him, man, he gets all hyper, he doesn\\'t even know why, he loves it! he walks around, going, \"god, i feel great!\" \\n\\ngeorge (laughing): you don\\'t tell him? \\n\\nelaine: no. \\n\\ngeorge: that is so funny! \\n\\nelaine: i know! \\n\\ngeorge: wait, have you ever seen him throw up?! \\n\\nkramer: please! please!! i take it all back, everything! i take it all back, every word! i love you! i love *you*! i can\\'t live without you, i,ll, i\\'ll do anything! \\n\\njerry: that\\'s right, gavin palone. what? are you sure? he was released on monday? *last* monday? did he leave a phone number or address? unbelievable. well thank you, thanks, thanks very much. (hangs up) that\\'s it, farfel! party\\'s over! start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you\\'re checking out! \\n\\nelaine: it was weird because george and i get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one. \\n\\njerry: oh, one-on-one\\'s a whole different game. can\\'t pass off. \\n\\nelaine: the only time it wasn\\'t uncomfortable was when we were making fun of you. \\n\\njerry: going to the dog pound, everybody! going to the dog pound, come on down. (to elaine) what? \\n\\nelaine: do you have to? \\n\\njerry: what am i supposed to do? i don\\'t want to do it. i like dogs. i\\'m not sure this is a dog. \\n\\nelaine: you know, the guy might have just lost your number. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m in the book and i have a machine. \\n\\nelaine: jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? they keep them there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them. \\n\\njerry: really? how late are they open? \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nelaine: what is it? \\n\\nkramer: i went back with ellen. \\n\\njerry and elaine: ohhhhh, that\\'s great. \\n\\nelaine: terrific. \\n\\njerry: yeah, i really think you guys are good together. \\n\\nelaine: yes, she understands you and she is not demanding. \\n\\nkramer: do you think that i forgot what you two said about her? \\n\\njerry: well i was just trying to be supportive, you know. i knew you were upset. \\n\\nkramer: from now on when we pass each other in the hall, i don\\'t know you, you don\\'t know me. \\n\\nelaine: oh, kramer, we didn\\'t mean it. \\n\\njerry: what are you doing? \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m getting my pot. \\n\\nelaine: kramer, we like her. \\n\\njerry: kramer? what did we say that\\'s so bad? \\n\\nelaine: i believe i referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit. \\n\\njerry: i said, \"how come no one\\'s killed her?\" probably shouldn\\'t have said anything, \\n\\njerry: well. \\n\\nelaine: well. \\n\\njerry: everyone knows the first break-up never takes. (answers buzzer) yeah? \\n\\ngeorge: prognosis negative! (again in a funny voice) \\n\\njerry: okay, farfel, put your shoes on. \\n\\nelaine: jerry, can\\'t you just give it one more day, it\\'s not his fault. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s not my dog, i don\\'t know where this boozehound is. \\n\\nelaine: alright, i tell you what. how about if you and george go to the movies, and i stay here and watch the dog tonight. \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t let you do that, what about prognosis negative? \\n\\nelaine: we\\'ll see it sunday. \\n\\ngeorge: tonight\\'s the night, right? prognosis negative? \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m not going, i\\'m gonna watch the dog. \\n\\ngeorge: what does this mean? \\n\\njerry: well, we\\'ll go see something else tonight. we\\'ll see, uh, ponce de leon. \\n\\ngeorge: what is with this dog, i thought we were taking it to the pound. \\n\\njerry: she talked me into one more day. talk amongst yourselves, i\\'m gonna go to the bathroom. \\n\\ngeorge: uh jerry, how long will you be in there? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know, regular human time? \\n\\ngeorge: uh why don\\'t you wait then go in the movies? \\n\\njerry: why shouldn\\'t i go here? \\n\\nelaine: well, you know, i mean, sometimes it\\'s good to get there and make sure you get your seats and then go to the bathroom. \\n\\ngeorge: and isn\\'t it more fun using the urinal? \\n\\nelaine: yeah. \\n\\njerry: oh yeah, urinals are fun. can i go?! \\n\\ngeorge: hey, go. \\n\\nelaine: who\\'s stopping you? \\n\\ngeorge: what, are you doing me a favor? \\n\\nelaine: like we care if you go to the bathroom. \\n\\ngeorge: how\\'s it going? \\n\\nelaine: good. good. you? \\n\\ngeorge: things are good. \\n\\nelaine: boy, he takes such a long time. \\n\\ngeorge: i know. \\n\\nelaine: you know what he does in there? he gargles. \\n\\ngeorge: jerry gargles? is that why he takes so long? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, he does it like six times a day. \\n\\ngeorge: how come we never hear him? \\n\\nelaine: because he does it quiet. he does it quiet. lookit, just like this, watch. \\n\\ngeorge: wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?! \\n\\nelaine: we talked about that already. \\n\\ngeorge: oh. \\n\\ngeorge: i have nothing to say to anybody. i\\'m so uninteresting. i think i\\'m out of conversation. \\n\\njerry: so what are calling me six times a day? \\n\\ngeorge: all i know about is sports. that\\'s it. no matter how depressed i get, i could always read the sports section. \\n\\njerry: i could read the sports section if my hair was on fire. \\n\\ngeorge: know what? ponce de leon is sold out. \\n\\njerry: it is? oh yeah, you\\'re right. what else is playing? \\n\\ngeorge: nothing except prognosis negative. \\n\\njerry: boy, i know she really wants to see that with me. \\n\\nelaine: gimme the jacket, furface, this is not seinfeld you\\'re dealing with! when i get through with you, you\\'ll be begging to go to the pound! \\n\\nelaine: shut up. shut up! (answers phone) hello? no, who\\'s calling? oh my god, the dog guy. where have *you* been? yeah, well you better pick up your dog tonight or he has humped his last leg. \\n\\ngeorge: i mean, i could understand if there was something else playing, but it\\'s this or nothing. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know what to do. \\n\\ngeorge: what is this \\'saving movies\\' thing? something\\'s playing, you go. \\n\\njerry: i know, i know. \\n\\ngeorge: so, what? we\\'re gonna do nothing now, this is crazy. \\n\\njerry: it is kind of silly. \\n\\ngeorge: of course it is. \\n\\njerry: i mean, it\\'s just a movie, for god\\'s sake. \\n\\ngeorge: exactly. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s not like she\\'s *in* the movie. \\n\\ngeorge: right. \\n\\njerry: am i supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? i mean, if i could have seen it with her, fine. but i can\\'t control all these circumstances and schedules and peoples\\' availabilities at movies. \\n\\ngeorge: and she\\'ll still see it, you\\'re not stopping her from seeing it. \\n\\njerry: how does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level of enjoyment? you can\\'t talk during a movie. you know, this is stupid, c\\'mon, let\\'s just go. \\n\\ngeorge: good. \\n\\njerry: saving movies. \\n\\ngeorge: ridiculous! \\n\\njerry: two for prognosis negative. i\\'m in big trouble. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, you\\'re dead. \\n\\ngavin: bell\\'s palsy. the entire side of my, of, of my face was paralyzed. farfel! i couldn\\'t, i couldn\\'t, i couldn\\'t even feed myself, i was completely incapacitated. quiet farfel! \\n\\njerry: you know it\\'s interesting, because i called the hospital and they said you were released on monday. \\n\\ngavin: yes, yes, that\\'s true, but then i was taken to the bell\\'s palsy center in, in, in, in rockford. absolutely first, first rate facility, top notch physicians. \\n\\nkramer: hey, c\\'mon, c\\'mon, get off me! \\n\\ngavin: he won\\'t hurt you, he\\'s just playing. \\n\\nkramer: hey you keep that mutt away from me. \\n\\ngavin: mutt? i\\'ll wager his parents are more pure than yours. \\n\\nellen: kramer, are you coming? \\n\\njerry: oh, hi ellen. \\n\\nellen: get in here. \\n\\njerry: listen, it\\'s really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week, but if you don\\'t mind... \\n\\ngavin: pre-prediction. you\\'ll be calling me to ask if you can come and visit him before the month is out. \\n\\njerry: prediction. i never see you or him again for the rest of my life. \\n\\nelaine: we made plans. \\n\\njerry: why don\\'t we just rent a movie? \\n\\nelaine: i thought you wanted to see prognosis negative. \\n\\njerry: no, it&mac226;s, it\\'s supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. i mean it\\'s long, there\\'s no story, it\\'s so unbelievably boring, i heard. i... \\n\\nelaine: jerry, you promised me we\\'d go. \\n\\njerry: well, george told me the whole story, line for line, i mean i almost feel like i\\'ve seen it already and walked out on it. \\n\\nelaine: wait, george saw the movie? i saw him yesterday, he didn\\'t mention it. \\n\\njerry: you and george got together? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, i wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about. \\n\\njerry: hello. \\n\\nkramer: hi, hi, hi, hi, hi. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s up? \\n\\nkramer: well, ah you were right. \\n\\njerry: about what? \\n\\nkramer: ellen. we, uh, broke up again. \\n\\njerry and elaine, together: awwwwww. \\n\\njerry: too bad. \\n\\nelaine: i thought she was the one. \\n\\nkramer: i\\'ll bring back the pot. \\n\\nelaine: okay, c\\'mon it\\'s movie time. \\n\\nkramer: hey, what are you gonna see? \\n\\njerry: prognosis negative. \\n\\nkramer: hey, that\\'s supposed to be great. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s not. \\n\\nkramer: how do you know? \\n\\njerry: i have an instinct for these things. \\n\\njerry: i had a parakeet when i was a kid, that was the only pet that i really enjoyed. we used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and my mother had built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. she felt this gives you a feeling of space. have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? what kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes, \"hey look, there\\'s a whole nother room in there. there\\'s a guy in there looks just like me.\" but the parakeet will fall for this, you\\'ll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, bang! with his little head, he would just go \\'click\\' ohh! and i\\'d always think, even if he thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn\\'t he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet? \\n\\njerry: does it seem to you that the ventriloquist dummy has a very active sexual social life? he\\'s always talking about dates and women that he knows and bringing them back to the suitcase at night, there\\'s always a sawdust joke in there somewhere you know, kinky things cuz he\\'s made out of wood an\\' he can spin his head around, we\\'re somehow expected to believe because the face is soo animated that they think we aren\\'t noticing that the feet are just swinging there, dummy feet never look right do they? they\\'re just kinda dangling there, always kinda askew you know? you always see just little ankle, those thin fabric ankles that they have you know. ya think \\'i don\\'t think this thing is real.\\' \\n\\njerry: let me speak with the head librarian. ... because it\\'s absurd. an overdue book from 1971? ... this is a joke right? what are you? from a radio station? \\n\\nkramer: enters \\n\\njerry: ya\\' got me i fell for it. alright, ok i can be down there in like a half hour. bye. \\n\\nkramer: what\\'s the problem? \\n\\njerry: this you\\'re not goin\\' to believe. the nypl says that i took out tropic of cancer in 1971 and never returned it. \\n\\nkramer: do you know how much that comes to? that\\'s a nickel a day for 20 years. it\\'s going to be $50,000 \\n\\njerry: it doesn\\'t work like that. \\n\\nkramer: if it\\'s a dime a day it could be $100,000 \\n\\njerry: it\\'s not going to be anything. i returned the book. i remember it very vividly because i was with sherry becker. she wore this orange dress. it was the first time i ever saw her in a dress like that. in oticed since ninth grade she was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. and then one day ... \\n\\njerry: that orange dress is burned in my memory \\n\\nkramer: oh, memory burn. \\n\\njerry: i wonder what ever happened to her. \\n\\nkramer: how did they ever find you? \\n\\njerry: oh, computers, they\\'re cracking down now on overdue books. the whole thing is completely ridiculous. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s george. wait \\'til he hears we\\'re going to the library \\n\\nkramer: you know i never got a library card. \\n\\njerry: (to speaker) coming down. \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. people sitting around reading the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks trying to save a quarter, ooh, \\n\\njerry: i gotta go to the library. you want to go? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, \\n\\nkramer: the dewey decimal system, what a scam that was. boy that dewey guy really cleaned up on that deal. \\n\\njerry: where\\'s george \\n\\nreader: shhh. \\n\\nkramer: tryin\\' to save a quarter. \\n\\njerry: i kinda like those sticks. i\\'d like to get them in my house. \\n\\njerry: this woman\\'s completely ignoring me. \\n\\nkramer: look at her. this is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... spinster. ... maybe a virgin. ... maybe she got hurt a long time ago. she was a schoolgirl. there was a boy it didn\\'t work out. now she needs a little tenderness. she needs a little understanding. she needs a little kramer. \\n\\njerry: eventually a little shot of penicillin \\n\\nlibrarian: yes? \\n\\njerry: yeah i called before. i got his notice in the mail. \\n\\nlibrarian: oh, tropic of cancer, henry miller, uh, this case has been turned over to our library investigation officer mr. bookman. \\n\\nkramer: bookman? the library investigator\\'s name is actually, bookman? \\n\\nlibrarian: it\\'s true. \\n\\nkramer: that\\'s amazing. that\\'s like an ice cream man named, cone. \\n\\nlibrarian: lt. bookman has been working here for 25 years so i think he\\'s heard all the jokes. \\n\\njerry: can i speak with this bookman? \\n\\nlibrarian: just a second. \\n\\ngeorge: jerry, jerry \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\ngeorge: i think i saw him. i think it\\'s him. \\n\\njerry: who? \\n\\ngeorge: did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming obsenities and doing some calesthetics routine \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\nkramer: yeah \\n\\ngeorge: i think that\\'s mr. hayman. ...the gym teacher from our high school. \\n\\nreader: shhh. \\n\\njerry: (whispers) haymen, are you sure? \\n\\ngeorge: he\\'s older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but i think it\\'s him. \\n\\njerry: george got him fired. he squealed on him. \\n\\nkramer: ooh tattle tale \\n\\ngeorge: (yells) i didn\\'t tattle \\n\\nreader: shh shh \\n\\nkramer: what did this guy do? what happened? \\n\\ngeorge: there was an incident. i\\'d rather not discuss it. \\n\\nkramer: oh come on, you can tell me. \\n\\ngeorge: some other time. \\n\\nkramer: what tonight? \\n\\nkramer: y\\'know i never figured you for a squealer. \\n\\njerry: oh, he sang like a canary. \\n\\nlibrarian: mr. bookman\\'s not here. \\n\\njerry: not here? why was i told to come down here? \\n\\nlibrarian: he\\'ll be out all afternoon on a case. \\n\\nkramer: he\\'s out on a case? he actually goes out on cases? \\n\\njerry: well what am i supposed to do now? \\n\\nlibrarian: i\\'ll have mr. bookman get in touch with you. \\n\\njerry: all right thanks. come on lets go \\n\\ngeorge: let\\'s see if it\\'s hayman? \\n\\nkramer: hey, uh, i\\'ll see you boys later. (turns to librarian) so uh, what\\'s a guy got to do around here to get a library card? \\n\\nelaine: where\\'s karen? \\n\\nsecretary: she went to pick up lunch. \\n\\nelaine: well, she didn\\'t ask me what i wanted. \\n\\nsecretary: she must have forgot. \\n\\nelaine: how could she forget i\\'ve been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years? \\n\\nsecretary: i don\\'t know anything. \\n\\nelaine: ah, you don\\'t know anything. you see, \"i don\\'t know anything\", means there\\'s something to know. if you really didn\\'t know anything you would have said \"you\\'re crazy.\" \\n\\nelaine: oh, hi mr. lippman. \\n\\nlippman: elaine, \\n\\nelaine: um, uh, i was wondering if you got a chance to look at that , um, biography of columbus, i gave you? \\n\\nlippman: yes i did. yes i did. ... maureen this water is still too cold. \\n\\nelaine: ooh yeah, it\\'s freezing. ... hurts your teeth. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m tellin\\' ya\\' somethin\\' is goin\\' on. he never likes anything i recommend. and then that lunch thing. \\n\\njerry: so they forgot to get your lunch. big deal! \\n\\nelaine: what do you know. you\\'ve never worked in an office. (turns to george) see, george, you\\'ve worked in an office. jerry thinks i\\'m over reacting but you understand, ... lunch! \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t understand lunch, i don\\'t know anything about lunch. listen. just because i got the guy fired doesn\\'t mean i turned him into a bum - does it? \\n\\nelaine: what did he do? \\n\\ngeorge: he purposely mispronounced my name. instead of saying, \"costanza\" he\\'d say, \"can\\'t stand ja\". \"can\\'t stand ja\" ... he made me smell my own gym socks once. \\n\\njerry: i remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. and the straps were hangin\\' down by his ,... \\n\\ngeorge: ok, ok, i never even had him for gym. \\n\\njerry: i had him for hygene. remember his teeth. it was like from an exhumed corpse. \\n\\ngeorge: little baked beans \\n\\njerry: echh \\n\\nelaine: come on tell me what happened. \\n\\ngeorge: well, ok. as i said the guy had it in for me. he actually failed me in gym. ... me! \\n\\ngeorge: ... those spastic shnitzer twins ... \\n\\nheyman: can\\'t stand ja ... can\\'t stand ja \\n\\ngeorge: yes, mr. hayman \\n\\nheyman: your underwear was stick\\'n out of your shorts during gym class. \\n\\ngeorge: well i guess that\\'s because i wear boxer shorts. \\n\\nheyman: boxer shorts, ha ha, well what brand? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m not really sure, i... \\n\\nheyman: well let\\'s take a look. \\n\\ngeorge: he gave me a wedgie. \\n\\njerry: he got fired the next day. \\n\\nelaine: why do they call it a wedgie? \\n\\ngeorge: because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in.. \\n\\njerry: they also have an atomic wedgie. now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head. very rare. \\n\\nelaine: boys are sick. \\n\\njerry: well what do girls do ? \\n\\nelaine: we just tease some one \\'til they develop an eating disorder. guy who ruined his life. \\n\\ngeorge: i gotta go back to the library and talk to him. i gotta find out if i&mac226;m the guy who ruined his life. \\n\\nkramer: hey babaloo, you better get home. you know this guy bookman from the library he\\'s waiting for ya. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s amazing to me about the library is it\\'s a place where you go in you can take out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you\\'re done. it reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. that\\'s what the library is. a government funded pathetic friend. and that\\'s why everybody kinds of bullies the library. i\\'ll bring it back on time ... i\\'ll bring it back late. ... oh, what are you going to do? charge me a nickel? \\n\\njerry: oh, i\\'m glad you\\'re here, so we can get this all straightened out. would you like a cup of tea? \\n\\nbookman: you got any coffee? \\n\\njerry: coffee? \\n\\nbookman: yeah. coffee. \\n\\njerry: no, i don\\'t drink coffee. \\n\\nbookman: yeah, you don\\'t drink coffee? how about instant coffee? \\n\\njerry: no, i don\\'t have-- \\n\\nbookman: you don\\'t have any instant coffee? \\n\\njerry: well, i don\\'t normally-- \\n\\nbookman: who doesn\\'t have instant coffee? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t. \\n\\nbookman: you buy a jar of folger\\'s crystals, you put it in the cupboard, you forget about it. then later on when you need it, it\\'s there. it lasts forever. it\\'s freeze-dried. freeze-dried crystals. \\n\\njerry: really? i\\'ll have to remember that. \\n\\nbookman: you took this book out in 1971. \\n\\njerry: yes, and i returned it in 1971. \\n\\nbookman: yeah, \\'71. that was my first year on the job. bad year for libraries. bad year for america. hippies burning library cards, abby hoffman telling everybody to steal books. i don\\'t judge a man by the length of his hair or the kind of music he listens to. rock was never my bag. but you put on a pair of shoes when you walk into the new york public library, fella. \\n\\njerry: look, mr. bookman. i--i returned that book. i remember it very specifically. \\n\\nbookman: you\\'re a comedian, you make people laugh. \\n\\njerry: i try. \\n\\nbookman: you think this is all a big joke, don\\'t you? \\n\\njerry: no, i don\\'t. \\n\\nbookman: i saw you on t.v. once; i remembered your name--from my list. i looked it up. sure enough, it checked out. you think because you\\'re a celebrity that somehow the law doesn\\'t apply to you, that you\\'re above the law? \\n\\njerry: certainly not. \\n\\nbookman: well, let me tell you something, funny boy. y\\'know that little stamp, the one that says \"new york public library\"? well that may not mean anything to you, but that means a lot to me. one whole hell of a lot. sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. i\\'ve seen your type before flashy, making the scene, flaunting convention. yeah, i know what you\\'re thinking. what\\'s this guy making such a big stink about old library books? well, let me give you a hint, junior. maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. maybe. sure, we\\'re too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the cat in the hat and the five chinese brothers? doesn\\'t he deserve better? look. if you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you\\'d better think again. this is about that kid\\'s right to read a book without getting his mind warped! or maybe that turns you on, seinfeld; maybe that\\'s how y\\'get your kicks. you and your good-time buddies. well i got a flash for ya, joy-boy party time is over. y\\'got seven days, seinfeld. that is one week! \\n\\nkramer: what\\'s wrong? \\n\\nmarion: it\\'s bookman the library cop. \\n\\nkramer: so i, i didn\\'t do anything wrong. \\n\\nmarion: i\\'m supposed to be at work. i could get fired. i shouldn\\'t have come here. \\n\\nkramer: why don\\'t ya\\' leave? \\n\\nmarion: i can\\'t. \\n\\njerry: no way i\\'m payin\\' that! i returned that book in 1971. i have a witness sherry becker. she wore an orange dress. she gave me a piece of black jack gum. it\\'s a licorice gum. what do ya\\' think of next i remember it. (thinks out loud, opens phone book) becker, ... becker, ... \\n\\nsherry: kevin went to a public school, he\\'s the 14 year old? we were gonna\\' send marsha to a private school. cause in some way they don\\'t learn ... enough ... i think. \\n\\njerry: so sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library? \\n\\nsherry: i remember it like it was yesterday. it was a friday afternoon. i wore a purple dress. \\n\\njerry: purple? ya\\' sure it wasn\\'t orange? \\n\\nsherry: positive. and i was chewin\\' dentyne. i always chewed dentyne. remember jerry? dentyne? \\n\\njerry: no black jack? \\n\\nsherry: uch! licorice gum? never! we were ah, reading pasages to each other from that henry miller book, \\n\\njerry: tropic of cancer. \\n\\nsherry: no, tropic of capricorn \\n\\njerry: tropic of capricorn? \\n\\nsherry: rememba? what holds the world togetha\\' ... \"as i have learned from bitter experience is sexual intercourse .\" \\n\\njerry: wait a second. wait a second. you\\'re right. i had both of them. \\n\\njerry: george, here\\'s the book. don\\'t let anybody see it. don\\'t let anything happen to it. \\n\\ngeorge: jerry, it\\'s me, george, don\\'t worry, i\\'ll return it \\n\\njerry: ok, i\\'ll see you after school. i.m late for hayman\\'s hygiene. \\n\\nsherry: where ya\\' going? \\n\\njerry: it was nice seeing you again. i just remembered something. i\\'ve got to go. (to old man that enters) it was george! \\n\\nkramer: read another poem. \\n\\nmarion: pressed chest fleshed out west might be the saviour or a garden pest. \\n\\nkramer: wow, that is great. you should be published. \\n\\nkramer: you know, the library is kind of a cool place when it\\'s closed. \\n\\nmarian: oh, yeah. you don\\'t have to be quiet. listen to the echo hello! \\n\\nkramer: hello! \\n\\nmarian: hello! \\n\\nkramer: hello! \\n\\nmarian: hello! \\n\\nbookman (emerging): hello! \\n\\nmarian (turning, surprised): mr. bookman. \\n\\nbookman: i remember when the librarian was a much older woman kindly, discreet, unattractive. we didn\\'t know anything about her private life. we didn\\'t want to know anything about her private life. she didn\\'t have a private life. while you\\'re thinking about that, think about this the library closes at five o\\'clock, no exceptions. this is your final warning. got that, kewpie-doll? \\n\\nelaine: lippman want\\'s to see me in his office see me! that can\\'t be good \\n\\njerry: maybe you\\'re getting\\' a raise. \\n\\nelaine: maybe i\\'m getting\\' a wedgie. \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s george \\n\\nelaine: george is on his way up. \\n\\njerry: wait \\'til i tell him about the book. \\n\\nkramer: (reading) sobs \\n\\nelaine: are you ok? what? what? \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s marion\\'s poetry. i can\\'t take it (leaves sobbing) \\n\\nelaine: remember that biography i recommended? my boss hated it \\n\\njerry: i\\'m right here. \\n\\nelaine: remember that columbus book? \\n\\njerry: columbus, euro trash. \\n\\ngeorge: well, it\\'s definetly him. \\n\\nelaine: him? him who? \\n\\ngeorge: him who? hayman him. \\n\\nelaine: hayman the gym teacher? you found him? \\n\\ngeorge: oh, i found him. he was sitting on the steps of the library. i sat down next to him. he smelled like the locker room after that game against erasmus \\n\\njerry: that was double overtime. \\n\\ngeorge: so i said, \"mr. hayman, it\\'s me george costanza, jfk, ... \" he doesn\\'t move. so i said uh, \"can\\'t stand ya\\'\", \"can\\'t stand ya\\'\" he turns and smiles, the little baked bean teeth. i get up to run away, but something was holding me back. it was heyman. he had my underwear. there i was on the steps of the 42nd st. library , a grown man, getting a wedgie. \\n\\nelaine: at least it wasn\\'t atomic. \\n\\ngeorge: it was. \\n\\njerry: so georgie boy, guess what happened to tropic of cancer \\n\\ngeorge: how should i know? \\n\\njerry: because i gave it to you. \\n\\ngeorge: me? \\n\\njerry: yeah, think. don\\'t you remember you kept begging me to see it then finally i agreed. you were supposed to return it. i met you in the gym locker room. \\n\\ngeorge: the locker room! \\n\\njerry: here\\'s the book. don\\'t let anybody see it. don\\'t let anything happen to it. \\n\\ngeorge: jerry, it\\'s me, george, don\\'t worry, i\\'ll return it tomorrow, no problem. \\n\\njerry: all right, i\\'ll see you after school. i,,m late for hayman\\'s hygiene. \\n\\nheyman: can\\'t stand ya\\'. \\n\\ngeorge: yes mr. hayman. \\n\\nheyman: your underwear was stick\\'n out of your shorts during gym class. \\n\\ngeorge: well i guess that\\'s because i wear boxer shorts. \\n\\nheyman: boxer shorts, ha? well what brand? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m not really sure, i... \\n\\nheyman: well let\\'s take a look. \\n\\ngeorge: (shouting) no no no! \\n\\njerry: anyway, i hope there\\'s no hard feelings. \\n\\nbookman: hard feelings? what do you know about hard feelings? y\\'ever have a man die in your arms? y\\'ever kill somebody? \\n\\njerry: what is your problem? \\n\\nbookman: what\\'s my problem? punks like you, that\\'s my problem. and you better not screw up again seinfeld, because if you do, i\\'ll be all over you like a pitbull on a poodle. \\n\\njerry: (after bookman exits) that is one tough monkey! (turns to elaine) so you were saying? \\n\\nelaine: oh? so, i took your suggestion and i gave my boss marion\\'s poems. the ones that affected kramer so much. \\n\\njerry: oh, beautiful did he like them? \\n\\nelaine: no, ... he didn\\'t! no, ... he didn\\'t! \\n\\njerry: (to george) was he out there? \\n\\ngeorge: na, he\\'s gone. i wonder what happened to him. \\n\\njerry: i guess we\\'ll never know. \\n\\nheyman: can\\'t stand ya, (laughing) can\\'t stand ya. (pan to tropic of cancer on ground) \\n\\njerry: any day that you had gym it was a weird school day, you know what i mean because it kind of like started of kind of normal. you have like english, geometry, social studies and then suddenly you\\'re like in lord of the flies for 40 minutes you know you\\'re hangin\\' from a rope. you have hardly any clothes on. teachers are yellin\\' at ya\\' \"where\\'s your jock strap?\" ya\\' know and kids are throwin\\' dodge balls at you. you\\'re tryin\\' to survive ... then its history, science, language. there\\'s something off in the entire flow of that day. \\n\\n[act one scene a int. escalator - going down to a garage. in single file: george, jerry and elaine, who\\'s carrying a plastic bag with goldfish, and kramer who\\'s having a rough time with a large, heavy box.] \\n\\ngeorge: one left...what a joke. \\n\\nkramer: you can have this one. \\n\\ngeorge: no, that\\'s not enough btus for my living room...that was a complete waste of time. \\n\\nelaine: hey, i didn\\'t get one either. \\n\\njerry: why do i always have the feeling that everybody\\'s doing something better than me on saturday afternoons? \\n\\nelaine: this is what people do. \\n\\njerry: no they don\\'t. they\\'re out on some big picnic. they\\'re cooking burgers. they\\'re making out on blankets. they\\'re not at some mall in jersey watching their friends trying to find the world\\'s cheapest air-conditioner. \\n\\ngeorge: you should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car. he\\'d go from state to state. he was away for weeks at a time. it was like he was running for president and he was going through the primaries. we\\'d get phone calls from motels in new hampshire. \\n\\nelaine: so we took a little ride. what\\'s the big deal? \\n\\ngeorge: well at least you accomplished something. you got fish. \\n\\njerry: big accomplishment. \\n\\ngeorge: fish. what do they do? \\n\\nelaine: what do you do? \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s this way. \\n\\ngeorge: what time is it?

\\n\\njerry: of course we\\'ll hit traffic. it\\'s rush hour. \\n\\nelaine: isn\\'t it going the other way? \\n\\njerry: there is no other way in new york. everybody goes every way all the time. \\n\\nelaine: but it\\'s saturday. \\n\\njerry: you got the picnic and burger traffic. \\n\\ngeorge: i always get myself in this position. can\\'t be on time. gotta rush. \\n\\nelaine: what\\'s the matter? \\n\\njerry: i have to go to the bathroom. why do they hide the bathroom in these malls? \\n\\njerry: (cont\\'d) you want me to help you with that? \\n\\nkramer: no, no, i got it. \\n\\njerry: (to george, rewoman) what do you think, georgie boy? \\n\\ngeorge: did i need that pointed out for me? what is that going to do for me? how does that help me, to see her? i\\'m trying to live my life. don\\'t show me that. \\n\\nkramer: if you like her, go talk to her. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, right. i\\'ll just go up and say, \"hi, how ya\\' doing? would you like a glass of white wine?\" jerry before you got within twenty feet of this woman, she\\'d have her finger on the mace button. she\\'s like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. any sudden movement in the area could set her off. \\n\\nkramer: she\\'s fat. \\n\\nelaine: oh she\\'s fat? \\n\\nelaine: what? jerry where\\'s the car? \\n\\nkramer: i thought it was here. \\n\\ngeorge: you don\\'t know where we parked? \\n\\ngeorge: oh, this is great. \\n\\nkramer: blue-one. i thought it was blue-one. \\n\\njerry: i thought it was green. i remember seeing green. \\n\\nelaine: i didn\\'t pay attention. \\n\\ngeorge: this is just what i need. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m sure it\\'s right around here. \\n\\nkramer: it looks familiar. i remember the elevator. \\n\\ngeorge: there\\'s elevators all over! it all looks the same. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s over there. i know where it is. \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s black, right? \\n\\nkramer: dark blue. \\n\\ngeorge: (mumbling) you come to a parking lot, you write it down. how hard is that? \\n\\njerry: there it is!...no, no that\\'s a toyota. \\n\\njerry: (cont\\'d) hmmm...i thought it was... \\n\\nkramer: didn\\'t we come in over there? \\n\\njerry: i thought it was over there. \\n\\nelaine: how long can fish live in one of these plastic bags? \\n\\nkramer: about two hours. \\n\\nelaine: (she looks at her watch) you\\'d better find this car. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s this way... and they take off again, pairing off \\n\\njerry: i really have to go to the bathroom. \\n\\nkramer: why don\\'t you go behind one of these cars? j \\n\\nkramer: (cont\\'d) why? nobody\\'s around. \\n\\njerry: i\\'ll wait. \\n\\nkramer: you know when you hold it in like that you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder. that\\'s what happens to truck drivers. they hold it in all the time. eventually it starts coming out involuntarily. \\n\\njerry: alright. \\n\\nkramer: jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry? \\n\\njerry: maybe i should just go anytime i get the urge like you...wherever i am. there\\'s too much urinary freedom in this society. i\\'m proud to hold it in. it builds character. \\n\\nelaine: (re car) there it is!...no that\\'s not it. \\n\\nelaine: (cont\\'d) hey, watch it. ...did you see that car? maniac. can you explain something to me? i got six questions wrong on my drivers test. that\\'s the maximum. i read the book, i\\'m a college graduate. this is a country where fifty percent of its high school students can\\'t locate europe on a map. how are they all passing that test? it\\'s a mystery. \\n\\ngeorge: ...six wrong? \\n\\nelaine: those school zones are a killer. \\n\\njerry: (to kramer, rebox) will you let me help you with that? \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m gonna put it down behind that car. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re not worried somebody\\'s gonna pee on it? \\n\\nkramer: (to george) pink eleven. remember that. \\n\\ngeorge: oh i got it. (to jerry) that i\\'m supposed to remember. where the car is, that\\'s insignificant. \\n\\nelaine: (looking at fish) i think they\\'re laboring. \\n\\nkramer: look at this place. it\\'s huge... \\n\\ngeorge: i can tell you this. if i am not in front of my house at six-fifteen, when my parents get there, they will put me on an aggravation installment plan that will compound with interest for decades. \\n\\njerry: parents never forget a foul-up. i once left a jacket on the bus when i was fourteen. last week i\\'m flying to chicago to do a show, \"make sure you hang on to your jacket.\" \\n\\ngeorge: where the hell is this car, kramer? \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s got to be here. \\n\\nelaine: why are they using so many colors? and the numbers go up to forty. \\n\\njerry: maybe it\\'s not on this level. \\n\\ngeorge: what? \\n\\njerry: there are four different levels. maybe we\\'re on the wrong level. how long was the escalator ride up? \\n\\nelaine: it felt like a couple of levels. \\n\\njerry: you should always carry a pad and pen. \\n\\ngeorge: i can\\'t carry a pen. i\\'m afraid i\\'ll puncture my scrotum. \\n\\nkramer: i have a pen. \\n\\njerry: where was the bathroom in this mall? there are six-hundred stores, i didn\\'t see one bathroom. what is this, like a joke? they finished building the mall and they go, \"oh my god, we forgot the bathrooms.\" \\n\\nmother: (o.c.) don\\'t you dare talk to me like that! you hear me? \\n\\nelaine: look at that woman. \\n\\nmother: i told you! i don\\'t care! you\\'ll have to wait. \\n\\ngeorge: (to woman) hey, is that necessary? \\n\\nmother: (to george) why don\\'t you mind your own business? \\n\\ngeorge: i think hitting a defenseless child is my business. \\n\\nkid: (to george) you\\'re ugly. \\n\\ngeorge: ...what? \\n\\nkid: you\\'re ugly. \\n\\ngeorge: you are! \\n\\nkid: you are! \\n\\ngeorge: i should\\'ve hit the little son-of-a-bitch. i can\\'t stand kids. adults think it\\'s so wonderful how honest kids are. i don\\'t need that kind of honesty. i\\'ll take a deceptive adult over an honest kid any day. \\n\\nkramer: (re car) i found it! \\n\\nelaine: he\\'s got it. \\n\\nkramer: oh...no. \\n\\njerry: all right, that\\'s it. from now on no more calling out they found it, unless we\\'re sitting in it. okay? \\n\\nelaine: jerry, look at my fish. \\n\\njerry: his eyes look a little cloudy. \\n\\ngeorge: oh are they gonna be furious. \\n\\njerry: who\\'s got the tickets? george i do. (to kramer) i thought you knew this mall. you said you\\'d been here before! \\n\\nkramer: it was easy the last time. \\n\\nelaine: my fish are dying right in front of me! we have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car. \\n\\njerry: no one\\'s going to do that. \\n\\nelaine: excuse me, we can\\'t seem to find our car. i was wondering if it would be possible if you\\'re not in a hurry, to drive us around the garage for five minutes so we can look. \\n\\nman #1: (holding his hands up) ...sorry. \\n\\nelaine: five minutes. \\n\\nman #1: can\\'t do it. \\n\\nelaine: we\\'re not wilding. \\n\\nelaine: (cont\\'d) excuse me - i can\\'t seem to find my car - do you think you could drive me... \\n\\nelaine: (cont\\'d) oh that\\'s funny? is that funny? well tell me if you think this is funny these fish are dying! they\\'re gasping for oxygen right now! they\\'ll be floating in an hour. is that funny too? \\n\\njerry: those are really ugly sneakers. where did you get those? \\n\\nkramer: right here at the mall. \\n\\nelaine: excuse me... \\n\\nelaine: (cont\\'d) sorry to have disturbed you. terribly sorry. but the fish will be dead. you do know that. they can\\'t live in plastic. that\\'s not me talking, that\\'s science. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s amazing how shopping makes me have to go. all i have to do is walk into a department store and it\\'s like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in. \\n\\nkramer: you drank a whole bottle of water. \\n\\njerry: i know. \\n\\nkramer: so why don\\'t you just go? \\n\\njerry: no i can\\'t. \\n\\nkramer: don\\'t you get tired of following rules? \\n\\njerry: you think i\\'m too cautious? \\n\\nkramer: why be uncomfortable if you don\\'t have to? it\\'s organic. \\n\\njerry: organic. so\\'s buddy hackett. \\n\\nkramer: buddy hackett? \\n\\njerry: he\\'s a comedian. \\n\\nkramer: i know. \\n\\njerry: all right. all right. \\n\\nkramer: (pointing) you can go over here. \\n\\njerry: i can manage. \\n\\nkramer: (turns away and spots george) george! (leaves scene) \\n\\nkramer: it\\'ll take you ten seconds. \\n\\njerry: okay, okay. i\\'ll be right back. \\n\\nsecurity guard: okay, let\\'s go. come with me. \\n\\njerry: but... \\n\\nsecurity guard: come on. \\n\\njerry: (starts to leave, to himself) ...kramer \\n\\njerry: i\\'ve had this condition since i was eleven! i\\'ve been in and out of hospitals my whole life. i have no control over it. doctors have told me that when i feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. otherwise, i could die. \\n\\nsecurity guard: well you\\'re still not allowed. \\n\\njerry: do you hear what i\\'m saying to you?! i\\'m telling you that if i don\\'t go, i could die. die. is it worth dying for? \\n\\nsecurity guard: that\\'s up to you. \\n\\njerry: so you don\\'t care if i die. \\n\\nsecurity guard: what i care about is the sanitary condition of the parking facility. \\n\\njerry: it was life and death. \\n\\nsecurity guard: uh huh. \\n\\njerry: oh i\\'m lying. why would i do it unless i was in mortal danger? i know it\\'s against the law. \\n\\nsecurity guard: i don\\'t know. \\n\\njerry: because i could get uromysitisis poisoning and die. that\\'s why!...do you think i enjoy living like this?...the shame, the humiliation...you know i have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning. \\n\\njerry: (c0nt\\'d) him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. you want to call the department of social services? oh, it\\'s saturday. they\\'re closed today. my luck. \\n\\nsecurity guard: you can tell the police all about it. \\n\\nkramer: (calling out) jerry! \\n\\nelaine: jerry! \\n\\ngeorge: unbelievable, i\\'m never gonna get out of here. the guy goes to pee, he never comes back. it\\'s like a science fiction story. \\n\\nelaine: maybe he went to one of the other levels. i\\'ll go look for him. \\n\\ngeorge: oh now you\\'re gonna go? elaine i\\'ll be back in five minutes. \\n\\ngeorge: if you go now, i know what\\'s gonna happen. we\\'ll find the car, jerry will show up, and then we\\'ll never find you. \\n\\nelaine: no, no, i\\'ll be back. \\n\\ngeorge: oh what\\'s the difference? we\\'ll all be dead eventually. \\n\\nkramer: does that bother you? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, it bothers me. doesn\\'t it bother you? \\n\\nkramer: not at all. \\n\\ngeorge: see now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, cause it\\'s people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because you\\'re not bothered by it. how could it not bother you? \\n\\nkramer: i once saw this thing on t.v. with people who are terminally ill. and they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, yeah. i\\'ve heard that. meanwhile i\\'m here with you in a parking garage, what am i supposed to do? \\n\\njerry: first of all you don\\'t even know technically that i went. that\\'s for starters. i mean i could\\'ve been pouring a bottle of water out there. you don\\'t know. \\n\\nsecurity guard: i know what you did. \\n\\njerry: oh really, do you? well it just so happens that i did pour water out. i had a bottle of very tepid water and i poured it out. and i could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating. \\n\\njerry: (cont\\'d) and you know when you think about it it\\'s really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. that\\'s all it is. \\n\\nsecurity guard: yeah i\\'m sure. \\n\\njerry: you know this is not the first time this has happened to me. i always carry water because of my condition. it dehydrates me. it\\'s a vicious cycle. \\n\\nelaine: and now he\\'s gone. i\\'m sure he\\'s looking for the car. five minutes, that\\'s all. i just want to find him. \\n\\nman #1: i can\\'t do it. \\n\\nelaine: but why? why can\\'t you do it? \\n\\nman #1: i can\\'t. \\n\\nelaine: no, see that\\'s not a reason you can\\'t. you just don\\'t want to. \\n\\nman #1: that\\'s right. \\n\\nelaine: but why? why don\\'t you want to? \\n\\nman #1: i don\\'t know. \\n\\nelaine: but wouldn\\'t you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out? \\n\\nman #: 1 no, i wouldn\\'t. \\n\\njerry: (a new tack) all right, all right. i want to apologize. i was frightened, i said crazy things. i obviously offended you. i insulted your intelligence. the uromysitisis, the water bottle...i made it all up, and now...i\\'m going to tell you the truth. today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth, well i\\'m jumping ahead here, their forty-seventh wedding anniversary. we made arrangements to spend the evening together. they are supposed to be in front of my building at six-fifteen. \\n\\njerry: (cont\\'d) what i haven\\'t told you, or anyone else for that matter, is that my father\\'s been in a red chinese prison for the past fourteen years. \\n\\nkramer: the guy\\'s got a fat fetish. spector never dates a woman under two hundred-fifty pounds. \\n\\ngeorge: (not interested) really. \\n\\nkramer: what does he do with all that fat? does he just jump up and down on it? does he gouge it like killer kowalski? \\n\\ngeorge: who\\'s killer kowalski? \\n\\nkramer: he was a wrestler. he would grab hold of someone\\'s stomach and just squeeze it until they gave. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'ve gotta go to the bathroom. \\n\\nkramer: so go. george here? \\n\\nkramer: (shaking his head) you and jerry. \\n\\ngeorge: don\\'t you believe me? it\\'s their fiftieth anniversary. you know this is gonna kill him. you\\'re aware of that. kill him. on the biggest night of his life... \\n\\nsecurity guard: oh your folks have an anniversary today too? \\n\\njerry: (to george) was he also in a red chinese prison? \\n\\ngeorge: (to jerry, somewhat impressed) a red chinese prison? \\n\\nkramer: george! george! \\n\\nelaine: jerry! (then she checks her fish) \\n\\njerry: well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of red china\\'s great military leaders, general chang, who by the way came up with the recipe for general chang\\'s chicken. you know, the one with the red peppers and orange peel at szechwan gardens? george sure, i have it all the time. very spicy. \\n\\njerry: well general chang was a very flamboyant man. a complete failure as a general, but a helluva cook. \\n\\nelaine: (o.c.) jerry! jerry elaine?! \\n\\nelaine: (o.c.) jerry! over here... \\n\\nelaine: (cont\\'d) where have you been? \\n\\njerry: i was arrested for urinating. \\n\\ngeorge: (proudly) me too. \\n\\nelaine: you what? \\n\\njerry: i have uromysitisis. it\\'s very serious you know. \\n\\nelaine: look at my fish... (jerry examines it) is he... \\n\\njerry: no, but he\\'s not looking good... (elaine turns to two huge body builders in workout wear) \\n\\nelaine: (desperate) please, we can\\'t find our car. please drive us around the parking lot to find our car. my fish are dying. \\n\\nman #2: can\\'t do it. \\n\\nelaine: i can see not caring what happens to us, we\\'re human. but what about the fish? the fish? \\n\\nman #3: sorry. (they keep walking.) \\n\\nelaine: that\\'s right, go. go home to your dumbbells. work on your pecs. i\\'m really impressed. \\n\\nelaine: (cont\\'d) that\\'s right you heard me. you got a problem with that? \\n\\ngeorge: elaine, shut-up. \\n\\njerry: hey, where\\'s kramer? \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t know. (to elaine) where\\'s kramer? \\n\\nelaine: i thought he was with you. \\n\\ngeorge: see, i knew it. i knew this was gonna happen... \\n\\ngeorge: (cont\\'d) look at the time, that\\'s it. \\n\\nelaine: have we looked over there? have we checked that side? \\n\\ngeorge: we came in over there! \\n\\nelaine: we didn\\'t come in over there! \\n\\njerry: where\\'s kramer? \\n\\njerry: hey george, there she is again. ... \\n\\ngeorge: so what do you want me to do? \\n\\njerry: ask her to drive us around. there\\'s your opening. \\n\\ngeorge: that is an opening. \\n\\ngeorge: (cont\\'d) excuse me...i really... what\\'s happened is that my friend forgot where he parked and if you\\'re not in a big hurry, we\\'d really appreciate it if... \\n\\namy: oh sure, i\\'ll drive you around. \\n\\ngeorge: you will? \\n\\namy: sure. \\n\\ngeorge: thanks a lot. i\\'m really late. my parents are waiting in front of my building and we\\'re stuck here. \\n\\namy: i wouldn\\'t want to get lost in here. it smells like a toilet. people are such animals. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, right. \\n\\njerry: filthy pigs. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s a blue honda... \\n\\namy: this has happened to me too. it\\'s very frustrating. \\n\\nelaine: hi, i\\'m elaine. \\n\\njerry: jerry. \\n\\namy: hello. \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s very nice of you to do this. i\\'ve asked several people and they wouldn\\'t even answer me. \\n\\namy: i\\'m happy to do it. (to george) i\\'m amy. \\n\\ngeorge: hi amy, i\\'m george. \\n\\ngeorge: (talking in passenger window) i didn\\'t mean anything by it. i don\\'t even know l. ron hubbard! i didn\\'t know you were... \\n\\ngeorge: (cont\\'d) ...with that group. \\n\\nelaine: (shouting to amy) what about my fish? \\n\\njerry: boy, those scientologists. they can be pretty sensitive. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'ll say. \\n\\nelaine: what is it? (they discover what he\\'s staring at) the car! \\n\\njerry: the car! \\n\\ngeorge: the car! \\n\\nelaine: we found it. i can\\'t believe it! \\n\\ngeorge: kramer, kramer\\'s not here...i knew it. i knew it! i knew this would happen. (screaming) kramer! kramer! \\n\\njerry: kramer! \\n\\njerry: kramer. \\n\\nkramer: jerry? \\n\\njerry: yeah, over here. \\n\\nkramer: boy i had a helluva time finding that air-conditioner. i looked everywhere. i completely forgot where i hid it. you know where it was? \\n\\ngeorge: purple 23. \\n\\nkramer: right! purple 23. i could\\'ve used you. \\n\\ngeorge: sometimes it\\'s good to have a pencil to write these things down. \\n\\nkramer: what time is it? \\n\\ngeorge: seven forty-five. \\n\\nkramer: well at least there\\'s no traffic. \\n\\ngeorge: right. \\n\\nkramer: what time does that play start? \\n\\ngeorge: eight o\\'clock. \\n\\nkramer: that might be a problem. (to elaine) where\\'s your little bag of... \\n\\nkramer: (cont\\'d) oh...(takes out parking stub) boy this garage is going to cost a fortune. you know how long we were here? \\n\\ngeorge: she thinks i\\'m a nice guy. women always think i\\'m nice, but women don\\'tnice. \\n\\njerry: this is amazing, i haven\\'t seen one person go in to that restaurant since it opened. poor guy. \\n\\ngeorge: why is nice bad? what kind a of sick society we are living in, when nice is bad? \\n\\njerry: what\\'s that smell? what are you wearing? \\n\\ngeorge: what, a \\'little\\' cologne. \\n\\njerry: manly. \\n\\ngeorge: monica wants me to wear it. \\n\\njerry: so why didn\\'t you say no? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m too nice. \\n\\njerry: look at this poor guy. his family is probably in pakistan -- they\\'re waiting him to send back money. this is horrible. \\n\\ngeorge: she wants me to take an iq test. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s because you\\'re stupid enough to wear the cologne. \\n\\ngeorge: no, she\\'s taking this course in education for her masters. it\\'s part of her research project, so i have to be a guinea pig. \\n\\njerry: i\\'ve never been a guinea pig. i\\'ve been a sheep, a tody. \\n\\ngeorge: you know, i can\\'t talk to you anymore. \\n\\njerry: all right, i\\'m sorry. go ahead, you\\'re taking the iq test. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, and she\\'s going to find i\\'m a moron. you know, people think i\\'m smart, but i\\'m not smart. \\n\\njerry: who thinks you\\'re smart? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m not going to break a hundred on this thing. \\n\\njerry: what thing? \\n\\ngeorge: you don\\'t listen when people talk to you anymore! \\n\\njerry: oh, oh, the iq thing...yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m sure i have a low iq. i\\'ve been lying about my sat scores for 15 years. \\n\\njerry: what\\'d ya get? \\n\\ngeorge: what did i get or what do i say i got? \\n\\njerry: what do you say? \\n\\ngeorge: i say fourteen o nine (1409). \\n\\njerry: 1409, that\\'s a good score. \\n\\ngeorge: psst, you\\'re telling me. \\n\\njerry: what did you really get? \\n\\ngeorge: you are my friend. \\n\\njerry: of course. \\n\\ngeorge: i tell you everything, right? \\n\\njerry: i hope so. \\n\\ngeorge: well, this i take to the grave. \\n\\njerry: he\\'s serving mexican, italian, chinese. he\\'s all over the place. that\\'s why no one\\'s going in. \\n\\nelaine: why do you keep watching? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know, i\\'m obsessed with it. it\\'s like a spider in the toilet struggling for survival. and even though ya know he\\'s not going to make it, y-y-you kind of root for him for a second. \\n\\nelaine: and then you flush. \\n\\njerry: well, it\\'s a spider. \\n\\nelaine: you know, sometimes people won\\'t go in a place, if they don\\'t see anyone else in there. \\n\\nelaine: do you have to do that? jerry, don\\'t do that, that is so annoying. \\n\\njerry: bazooka joe. \\n\\njerry: the buzzer. \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s your house. \\n\\njerry: my house? you gotta be on the lease to press to buzzer. yeah?

(elaine laughs - hu) why can\\'t you live? \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s just a latin phrase george, it does not mean anything. now, what is this test? \\n\\njerry: this woman he\\'s dating is making him take this iq test for this course. \\n\\nelaine: oh, that sounds like fun. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, fun. iq tests are totally bogus. they prove nothing. \\n\\nelaine: you\\'ll do well, you\\'re smart. \\n\\njerry: no see, he\\'s not smart. people think he\\'s smart, but he\\'s not. \\n\\nelaine: wha\\'d you get on your sat\\'s? \\n\\ngeorge: it varies. \\n\\njerry: you know, i don\\'t even know my iq. \\n\\nelaine: huh, mine\\'s 145. \\n\\ngeorge: 145! \\n\\njerry: get out of here! \\n\\nelaine: you get out of here! \\n\\njerry: you get out of here! \\n\\nelaine: huhuhuhuhuhuhu (laughing) \\n\\ngeorge: shst, you should take the test for me. \\n\\nelaine: huh. \\n\\njerry: boy that\\'d be something, cheating on a iq test. \\n\\ngeorge: haha (laughs) \\n\\njerry: hey, remember in college when you passed lettick the test out the window? you became a legend after that. (stepping over elaine then george\\'s legs to get to the large blue chair and sits down.) \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, yeah i really had some guts back then. why don\\'t we do it again? \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\ngeorge: you could take the iq test for me. i could pass it to you out a window. we could do it, she lives in the first floor. \\n\\nelaine: are you serious? \\n\\ngeorge: why not? \\n\\nelaine: where would i take the test? \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t know, she lives right around the corner. you could take it here or go to the coffee shop. \\n\\nelaine: no, that\\'d be too noisy. \\n\\njerry: take it to dream cafe, you won\\'t hear a peep. \\n\\nelaine: hey, what do you think? \\n\\njerry: hey, i love a good caper. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, that\\'s what is, isn\\'t it? a caper. huh. \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'ll do it? \\n\\nelaine: what the hey. \\n\\ngeorge: yeaah, beautiful...

(pregnant pause) so how about that kramer, huh? \\n\\naudrey: how about him? \\n\\ngeorge: they way he just says stuff. \\n\\naudrey: he sure does. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. yeah, he\\'s quite a character. \\n\\naudrey: so, what did you think? \\n\\ngeorge: about the pizza? \\n\\naudrey: no, about the nose job. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, the nose job. i don\\'t know, what did you think? \\n\\naudrey: well, i\\'ve thought about it, but i don\\'t know. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. (another pause) not that i care, one way or the other, but these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined. and again, i\\'m not suggesting. \\n\\naudrey: i know, they\\'re good. \\n\\ngeorge: peter jennings had one. \\n\\naudrey: really? \\n\\ngeorge: probably. they all do. in my high school, half my graduating class had them. of course, i\\'m from long island, so... \\n\\naudrey: uh huh. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s really nothing, it\\'s like going to the dentist. \\n\\naudrey: i hate the dentist. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s a cleaning. \\n\\naudrey: so you really think i should do this? \\n\\ngeorge: if it makes you happy, i don\\'t focus on these things. i will tell you this unfortunately, we live in a very superficial society. i don\\'t condone it, but it\\'s a fact of life. \\n\\naudrey: well, maybe i should. \\n\\ngeorge: what the hell. \\n\\nelaine: (barging in) aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job? \\n\\ngeorge: me? i didn\\'t say anything. \\n\\nelaine: you encouraged her to get one. \\n\\ngeorge: i didn\\'t encourage. no encourage. \\n\\nelaine: peter jennings had one? \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s possible. \\n\\nelaine: well, i think you should accept her for who she is. \\n\\naudrey: no, george is right. i want to get one. \\n\\nelaine: i think it\\'s a mistake. \\n\\ngeorge: me too, really. unless you\\'d really like to get one. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m going straight to hell, no two ways about it. \\n\\njerry: well, it might not be hell but you\\'re gonna run into some bad dudes. \\n\\ngeorge: (checking his watch) hey, let\\'s get the check, she\\'s taking the bandages off at four o\\'clock. \\n\\njerry: we have time. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s exciting, isn\\'t it? she\\'s gonna have a whole new face. \\n\\njerry: it is exciting. \\n\\ngeorge: of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but... \\n\\njerry: please, please, isabel? she is the most despicable woman i have ever met in my life. i have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. it\\'s like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game. and i\\'m letting him win. \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'re not letting him win. he wins till you\\'re forty. \\n\\njerry: then what? \\n\\ngeorge: he still wins but it\\'s not a blowout. \\n\\njerry: she wants to be an actress. she makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her, and i do it because i\\'m so addicted to the sex, i\\'m helpless, i\\'ll do anything. so finally kramer comes in the other day. \\n\\njerry: (holding up a piece of paper) i don\\'t want to see this woman anymore but i haven\\'t got the will power to throw out her number. please, help me. help me. \\n\\nkramer: (taking the paper and tearing it to pieces) i\\'m proud of you. \\n\\njerry: so i\\'m never gonna see her again, i\\'m going cold turkey. \\n\\ngeorge: good for you. \\n\\njerry: i\\'ll tell you, the sex... i mean, i was like an animal. i mean it was just completely uninhibited. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s not like that at all. \\n\\nelaine: how do you even know the jacket is there? \\n\\nkramer: well i don\\'t, i\\'m guessing. \\n\\ngeorge: okay, look, audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that i was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know? now that you\\'re gonna be a great beauty, let\\'s not forget how this all began. you know, like if you\\'d listened to your friend, elaine, \\n\\naudrey: george? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah? \\n\\naudrey: enough. \\n\\njerry: alright, are we ready? come on, let\\'s get this show on the road. \\n\\nelaine: are you sure you want us here for this? \\n\\naudrey: yes. \\n\\njerry: shouldn\\'t a doctor do it? \\n\\naudrey: no, he said i could do it. okay, here goes. \\n\\ngeorge: very exciting, very exciting, it\\'s like watching a birth. \\n\\nelaine: it looks good. \\n\\njerry: great job. \\n\\nkramer: you got butchered. \\n\\njerry: let\\'s put him over here. \\n\\nkramer: (to a fleeing audrey) where are you going? \\n\\naudrey: (with hand covering nose) to the doctor! \\n\\nkramer: wait, wait, wait, i\\'ll go with you. \\n\\nelaine: how ya feeling? \\n\\ngeorge: too much salt in my diet. \\n\\nelaine: can i get you anything? \\n\\ngeorge: nah, i\\'m good. \\n\\nelaine: you sure? anything? \\n\\ngeorge: mmm, no. boy, it really didn\\'t come out too well, did it? \\n\\nelaine: no, it didn\\'t. no, it didn\\'t. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s like, all dented. \\n\\nelaine: seems to be. \\n\\ngeorge: well, i\\'m sure they\\'ll be able to fix it. you can\\'t stop modern science. can\\'t stop it, you can\\'t stop it. can\\'t stop science. can\\'t be stopped, no way, no how, science just marches-- \\n\\nelaine: shut up, george. \\n\\ngeorge: shut up? \\n\\nelaine: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: interesting. \\n\\njerry: come on, kramer, seriously, give me her number! \\n\\nkramer: i don\\'t have it, i threw it out. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re lying! you got it, i want that number! \\n\\nkramer: i told you, i threw it out. \\n\\njerry: give it to me! \\n\\nkramer: you told me not to give it to you, you made me promise. \\n\\njerry: well, i changed my mind, i want that number. \\n\\nkramer: you said, no matter what you do or say, i\\'m not to give you the number. \\n\\njerry: i was lying, give it to me! \\n\\nkramer: no, you told me not to! \\n\\njerry: i want that number! \\n\\nkramer: alright!

\\n\\nrental car agent: yes, we do, unfortunately we ran out of cars. \\n\\njerry: but the reservation keeps the car here. that\\'s why you have the reservation. \\n\\nrental car agent: i know why we have reservations. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t think you do. if you did, i\\'d have a car. see, you know how to take the reservation, you just don\\'t know how to *hold* the reservation and that\\'s really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. anybody can just take them. \\n\\nrental car agent: let me, uh, speak with my supervisor. \\n\\njerry: uh, here we go. the supervisor. you know what she\\'s saying over there? \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\njerry: hey marge, you see those two people over there? they think i\\'m talking to you, so you pretend like you\\'re talking to me, okay now you start talking. \\n\\nelaine: oh, you mean like this?

\\n\\njerry: yeah, you better give me the insurance, because i am gonna beat the hell out of this car. \\n\\nrental car agent: please fill this out. \\n\\nelaine: what do you think, you think i\\'m making a big mistake? \\n\\njerry: hey, if you enjoy being with him, that\\'s what\\'s important. \\n\\nelaine: i love being with him. i mean, i like being with him. it\\'s okay being with him. \\n\\nelaine: i just don\\'t enjoy being with him. \\n\\njerry: well that\\'s what\\'s important. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m meeting him for lunch at chadway\\'s around the corner, do i have to break up with him face to face or can i just wait and do it over the phone?

\\n\\nkramer: i didn\\'t say anything. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m gonna go break up with owen. \\n\\ngeorge: what was wrong with that? i had a different interpretation! do you know anything about this pretzel guy?! maybe he\\'s been in the bar a really long time and he\\'s really depressed because he has no job and no woman and he\\'s parking cars for a living! (out the window to honking cars) alright! alright! shut up! shut up! i hear you! i\\'m coming down! these pretzels are making me thirsty! \\n\\njerry: oh my god. \\n\\nelaine: call an ambulance. \\n\\njerry: boy, he took it hard. \\n\\nelaine: we were walking down the block right by your house and i was just about to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch. \\n\\njerry: (on the phone) hello? yes, i need an ambulance at one twenty nine west eighty-first street, apartment five-a. \\n\\nelaine: tell then to hurry! hurry! \\n\\njerry: (to elaine) it\\'s an ambulance.

(steps up to the counter) hi, i called before, uh, my car got smashed. \\n\\nelaine: so listen, what should i do? i mean if i break up with him now it\\'ll look like i\\'m abandoning him because of his condition, i\\'ll be ostracized from the community. \\n\\njerry: what community? there\\'s a community? \\n\\nelaine: of course there\\'s a community. \\n\\njerry: all these years i\\'m living in a community, i had no idea. \\n\\nrental car agent: sir the estimate on the damage to your car is two thousand eight hundred and sixty-six dollars. \\n\\njerry: hmm, well, i got the insurance and everything so... \\n\\nrental car agent: yes, now, uh, in your report you said that you were not the driver of the car at the time of the accident. \\n\\njerry: that is right, somebody else was driving. \\n\\nrental car agent: alright, well, sir, you\\'re only covered for when you\\'re driving the car. \\n\\njerry: uh huh, what\\'s that? \\n\\nrental car agent: you\\'re not covered for other drivers. \\n\\njerry: other drivers? \\n\\nrental car agent: um hm. \\n\\njerry: your whole business is based on other drivers. it\\'s a rented car. that\\'s who\\'s driving it, other drivers. doesn\\'t my credit card cover me or something? \\n\\nrental car agent: not that particular one. \\n\\njerry: well i got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you want, go ahead, whichever one, i don\\'t care. \\n\\nrental car agent: sir, if you had read the rental agreement-- \\n\\njerry: did you see the size of that document? it\\'s like the declaration of independence, who\\'s gonna read that? \\n\\nrental car agent: mr. seinfeld, as it stands right now, you are not covered for that damage and there is absolutely nothing that can be done about that. \\n\\njerry: these pretzels are making me thirsty. \\n\\nelaine: ahh, it\\'s good, isn\\'t it? yankee bean. why yankee bean, huh? don\\'t they have beans in the south? i mean if you order yankee bean in the south, are they offended? huh?

(trying to think of a word) \\n\\njerry: convulsing? \\n\\ngeorge: convulsing? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know, i\\'m trying to help you. \\n\\ngeorge: then i asked her if she wanted a drink. \\n\\njerry: you don\\'t drink. \\n\\ngeorge: i know but i couldn\\'t think of anything else to say to her. \\n\\njerry: so you started drinking. \\n\\ngeorge: so we started drinking, and i\\'ll tell you i don\\'t know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think i knew she was mopping the floor with me. \\n\\njerry: so how was it? \\n\\ngeorge: well the sex was okay, but i threw up from the hennigans. \\n\\njerry: good thing the cleaning lady was there. \\n\\nelaine: dick was fired. \\n\\njerry: you mean to tell me if i had put that drink six inches over to the right, and none of this would have happened. \\n\\nelaine: you knew he was an alcoholic. why\\'d you put the drink down at all? \\n\\njerry: what are you saying? \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m not saying anything. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re saying something. \\n\\nelaine: what could i be saying? \\n\\njerry: well you\\'re not saying nothing you must be saying something. \\n\\nelaine: if i was saying something i would have said it. \\n\\njerry: well why don\\'t you say it? \\n\\nelaine: i said it. \\n\\njerry: what did you say? \\n\\nelaine: nothing. it\\'s exhausting being with you. \\n\\njerry: yeah? \\n\\ngeorge: (over the speaker) it\\'s george. \\n\\njerry: come on up. \\n\\nelaine: hey, let me ask you something something. did george buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? (jerry is unconfortable) ooookay, you just gave me the answer. \\n\\njerry: no i didn\\'t. \\n\\nelaine: yes you did, yes you did. i saw your expression. \\n\\njerry: i didn\\'t have an expression. i have a deviated septum. i have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe. \\n\\nelaine: how much did he save? \\n\\njerry: frankly i am shocked that you would ask such a question (elaine sticking out her tongue like she isn\\'t buying a word of it) of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. that\\'s what you were seeing. \\n\\ngeorge: i have to talk to elaine. this cleaing lady is turning the screws on me. she\\'s pushing for this whole relationship thing. she keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, i could lose my job, i gotta do something to keep her quiet. \\n\\njerry: elaine is in the bathroom. she\\'s wise to whole red dot thing. she\\'s asking me all kinds of questions. \\n\\ngeorge: did you tell her anything? \\n\\njerry: no. \\n\\ngeorge: do you swear? \\n\\njerry: i\\'m not swearing. i don\\'t want to swear. \\n\\ngeorge: oh you told her didn\\'t you. \\n\\njerry: no. \\n\\nelaine: hey george, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount? \\n\\ngeorge: what? did i what? \\n\\nelaine: you did didn\\'t you. \\n\\ngeorge: elaine, i\\'m, i\\'m shocked. i\\'m shocked. here i go out in the spirit of the season (elaine looking like she\\'s not buying a word of it) and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful christmas sweater i have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at christmas and this is the thanks that i get at christmas. \\n\\nelaine: well jerry told me that you did. \\n\\ngeorge: you told her? how could you tell her? i told you not to say anything. \\n\\njerry: i didn\\'t tell her you stupid idiot. she tricked you. \\n\\ngeorge: elaine you don\\'t understand. i had 103 temperature when i bought that sweater. i was so dizzy i was seeing red dots everywhere. i thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. i couldn\\'t distinguish one red dot from another. i couldn\\'t afford anything. i have nothing. i haven\\'t worked for a really long time. (jerry is standing right behind george. jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts fake-crying in it.) i mean look, i have no clothes, look at what i\\'m wearing. it\\'s just a little red dot. \\n\\ngeorge: this is for you. \\n\\ncleaning woman: oh, georgie, you bought this for me? oh i knew you cared for me. \\n\\ngeorge: as you care for me. which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. what, with clarence thomas and everything. \\n\\ncleaning woman: okay, okay, can i open it now? \\n\\ngeorge: yes of course go ahead. my guess is you\\'re going to like this very much. \\n\\ncleaning woman: oh! is that cashmere? \\n\\ngeorge: of course it\\'s cashemere. \\n\\ncleaning woman: a cashmere sweater. oh georgie porgie! \\n\\ngeorge: just a little something for christmas. \\n\\ncleaning woman: when i was a little girl in panama, a rich american came to our town and he was wearing the softest most beautiful sweater. i said to him, \"what do you call this most beautiful fabric?\", and he said \"they call it cashmere\". i repeated the words \"cashmere, cashmere\". i asked if i could have it, and he said \"no. get away from me.\" then he started walk away. but i grabbed onto his leg screaming for him to give me the sweater and he dragged me through the street. and then he kicked at me with the other foot and threw some change at me. oh, but i didn\\'t want the change georgie. i wanted the cashmere. \\n\\ngeorge: i had a feeling you would like it. no, don\\'t try it on now, try it on later. \\n\\ncleaning woman: wow, look at this. it feels so beautiful. \\n\\ngeorge: take it off. you\\'re going to ruin it. \\n\\ncleaning woman: (noticing the dot) what\\'s this? \\n\\njerry: i was in the men\\'s room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. i like the hand blower i have to say. it takes a little bit longer, but i feel when you\\'re in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can. \\n\\ndick: the only stench is comming from you. \\n\\naudience: oooooh. \\n\\njerry: oh, wait a second, i believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen. hey dick i don\\'t know what your problem is. it\\'s not my fault you\\'re back on the wagon. \\n\\ndick: it\\'s off the wagon. \\n\\njerry: in the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town? \\n\\ndick: i don\\'t know. \\n\\njerry: on the wagon. don\\'t you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way? \\n\\ndick: you can\\'t drink on a wagon it would be too bumpy. \\n\\njerry: they had smooth trails. what about the cumberland gap? \\n\\ndick: what the hell do you know about wagons? \\n\\njerry: i know enough not to get on them. \\n\\nmr. lippman: i\\'m going to get right to the point. it has come to my attention that you and the cleaning woman have engaged in sexual intercourse on the desk in your office. is that correct? \\n\\ngeorge: who said that? \\n\\nmr. lippman: she did. \\n\\ngeorge: was that wrong? should i have not done that? i tell you i gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when i first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause i\\'ve worked in a lot of offices and i tell you peope do that all the time. \\n\\nmr. lippman: you\\'re fired. \\n\\ngeorge: well you didn\\'t have to say it like that. \\n\\nmr. lippman: i want you out of here by the end of the day. \\n\\ngeorge: what about the whole christmas spirit thing? any flexability there? \\n\\nmr. lippman: nah. wait, wait, she wanted me to give you this. \\n\\nelaine: you had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman. \\n\\ngeorge: you never had sex in the office before? \\n\\nelaine: no. i once made out with someone but that was it. \\n\\ngeorge: alright so you made out with someone. \\n\\nelaine: well that\\'s not sex. \\n\\ngeorge: kissing is sex. \\n\\nelaine: kissing is not sex. \\n\\njerry: george? \\n\\ngeorge: jerry. \\n\\nelaine: hey, did jerry leave that drink next to dick\\'s on purpose? \\n\\ngeorge: no. \\n\\njerry: george? \\n\\ngeorge: over here. \\n\\nelaine: what are you doing here? \\n\\njerry: i\\'m taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up. \\n\\nelaine: hey jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place? \\n\\njerry: i would say when the nipple makes its first appearance. \\n\\nelaine: so, george told me that you left the drink next to dick\\'s on purpose. \\n\\njerry: nice try. so guess who heckled me at the club last night. \\n\\ndick: merry christmas. \\n\\nelaine: oh my god that\\'s dick. it\\'s cape fear. \\n\\ngeorge: hide, hide under the desk. \\n\\nelaine: ow, ow move over. \\n\\njerry: get off of me. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'ve got no room. \\n\\ndick: is that cashmere? \\n\\ngeorge: of course it\\'s cashmere. \\n\\ndick: (noticing the dot) what\\'s this? \\n\\njerry: but in a way, i think i inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. i hate being around alcoholics because they\\'re either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. and those are the two statements that scare me the most. but i think he\\'s okay now because i have no idea how he feels about me. he\\'s finally off the wagon. \\n\\ndick: you mean on the wagon. \\n\\njerry: don\\'t get smart. \\n\\nkramer: all right, coney island. ok, you can take the b or the f and switch for the n at broadway lafayette, or you can go over the bridge to dekalb and catch the q to atlantic avenue, then switch to the irt 2, 3, 4 or 5, but don\\'t get on the g. see that\\'s very tempting, but you wind up on smith and 9th street, then you got to get on the r. \\n\\nelaine: couldn\\'t he just take the d straight to coney island? \\n\\nkramer: well, yeah... \\n\\nelaine: ok, what time is your job interview george? \\n\\ngeorge: 945 \\n\\njerry: remember, don\\'t whistle on the elevator. \\n\\ngeorge: why not? \\n\\njerry: that\\'s what willie loman told biff before his interview, in \\'death of a salesman\\'. \\n\\ngeorge: what, you are comparing me to biff loman, very encouraging. the biggest loser in history of american literature. \\n\\nelaine: all right, i\\'m gonna go. \\n\\njerry: what time is the lesbian wedding? \\n\\nelaine: 930 \\n\\ngeorge: lesbian wedding. how do they work bride and groom out, what do they flip a coin? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, they flip a coin. \\n\\ngeorge: what, was that not politically correct?

it\\'s too cold for you?\" \\n\\nguy: it\\'s him. \\n\\nroberta: what should we do? \\n\\nelaine: hide! \\n\\njerry: it\\'s not a surprise party! yeah (to intercom) \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s george \\n\\njerry: yeah, come on up. ... it\\'s not him. \\n\\nguy: if you don\\'t go out with me it\\'s because i\\'m a bar tender. \\n\\nelaine: look, i don\\'t think this is appropriate right now. \\n\\nguy: is it because i have a tissue in my nose? \\n\\nelaine: you\\'re getting warm. \\n\\ngeorge: we just came from chadway\\'s(?) what\\'s going on. \\n\\njerry: we\\'re having the intervention for richie. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, right, right, the intervention. should we leave? \\n\\njerry: well, uh.. \\n\\nnoel: (happily) elaine, hi. \\n\\nelaine: oh, hi noel \\n\\njerry: well, you\\'re looking well. \\n\\ngeorge: jerry, let me tell you something, \"a man without hand is not a man.\" i got so much hand i\\'m coming out of my gloves. i got to thank kramer. \\n\\nsteve: even if i were dragged through manure i still wouldn\\'t put that stuff on. \\n\\ngeorge: (to kramer) this man is a genius. genius! \\n\\nsteve: you think so? \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t think so i know so, kramer, come here i got to talk to you \\n\\nold man: the male kangaroo doesn\\'t have a pouch only the female has it. the male has pouch envy. \\n\\nelaine: (chuckles) \\n\\nelaine: (laughs) \\n\\nnoel: that laugh. that\\'s the laugh. that\\'s it. you\\'re the one. \\n\\nelaine: no, no. it was an accident. it really wasn\\'t my fault. it was jerry. \\n\\nnoel: you put a pez dispenser on her leg during my recital?. \\n\\njerry: i didn\\'t know she would laugh. \\n\\nnoel: you lied to me george, you lied to me. \\n\\ngeorge: no, i, uh, um, wa, wa, what did i do? ... where are you going? \\n\\nnoel: i ... am breaking up ... with you! \\n\\ngeorge: you can\\'t break up with me. i\\'ve got hand. \\n\\nnoel: and you\\'re going to need it. \\n\\njerry: hey richie \\n\\nrichie: so what\\'s going on? \\n\\njerry: it was pretty ugly from the get go. he\\'s not listening, he\\'s hostile, he\\'s talking back. \\n\\ngeorge: i can\\'t do these puzzles. \\n\\njerry: so he starts to get up he spots the pez dispenser on the coffee table \\n\\ngeorge: ah ah pez dispenser. \\n\\njerry: he picks it up - he stares at it - it\\'s like he\\'s hypnotized by it. then he\\'s telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the car with his father, and his father was trying to load one of them \\n\\ngeorge: well they\\'re hard to load. \\n\\njerry: tell me something i don\\'t know. so as the father\\'s trying to load it he loses control of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. nobody\\'s hurt but pez is all over the car. and the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition. \\n\\ngeorge: poor kid. \\n\\njerry: so as he\\'s telling the story he starts crying. \\n\\ngeorge: what did you do? \\n\\njerry: what do you think? i gave him my pez dispenser. \\n\\ngeorge: wow \\n\\njerry: two hours later he checks into smither\\'s clinic. i talked to the doctor yesterday. he\\'s doing great on the rehab. he\\'s hooked on pez. he\\'s eating them like there\\'s no tomorrow. \\n\\ngeorge: what\\'s a three letter word for candy? \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t do those things. \\n\\njerry: let me ask you a question. if you named a kid rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life? \\n\\nelaine: na. \\n\\njerry: what are you doing?

\\n\\ngina: you dont want to? \\n\\njerry: no, no, i want to. i, i very much want to. i, i desire to. i, i pine to. \\n\\ngina: then kiss me right in front of him. \\n\\njerry: i cant. what if he wakes up? \\n\\ngina: a man is lying here unconscious and youre afraid of him? what kind of a man are you? \\n\\njerry: a man who respects a good comma. if it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. but when a guys got a coma going like this  you dont want to mess with it. \\n\\nkramer: hey. \\n\\njerry: hey. \\n\\nkramer: did you hear about martin? \\n\\njerry: yeah, i heard. \\n\\nkramer: i cant believe hes in a coma. \\n\\nkramer: hes got my vacuum cleaner. you know i loaned it to him. he never returned it. the carpets are filthy. what am i going to do?

\\n\\nkramer: what, gina? why wait? why not just call doctor kavorkian? \\n\\njerry: you know i dont get that whole suicide machine. theres no tall buildings where these people live? they cant wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person? \\n\\nkramer: so whats going on between you and gina? \\n\\njerry: well, i went with her to the hospital last night. \\n\\nkramer: uh, uh. \\n\\njerry: so were in the room and shes trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him. \\n\\nkramer: uh, uh, you see thats the great thing about mediterranean women. all right, so what did you do? \\n\\njerry: nothing. \\n\\nkramer: ah, what kind of a man are you? the guy is unconscious in a coma and you dont have the guts to kiss his girlfriend? \\n\\njerry: i didnt know what the coma etiquette was. \\n\\nkramer: there is no coma etiquette. you see thats the beauty of the coma, man. it doesnt matter what you do around it. \\n\\njerry: so youre saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, its all up for grabs. you can just loot the coma victim. \\n\\nkramer: id give him 24 hours to get out of it. they cant get out of it in 24 hours, its a land rush. \\n\\njerry: so if the coma victim wakes up in a month, hes thrilled, he got out of the coma. he goes home, theres nothing left? \\n\\nkramer: nothing left! thats why im trying to get that vacuum cleaner. because somebodys going to grab it. \\n\\nrula: martins spirit came to you as a warning. \\n\\nelaine: why would he come to george?

\\n\\nrula: yes. \\n\\ngeorge: did you buy this for me? \\n\\nrula: no, why? \\n\\ngeorge: ha, because i love drakes coffee cake. \\n\\nrula: maybe i did. \\n\\nelaine: take it away. \\n\\ngeorge: she hasnt eaten in two days. \\n\\nrula: whos pauline?

\\n\\nrula: george, i am going to tell you something and i want you to really hear me. \\n\\nelaine: now listen. i just dont know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth. \\n\\ngeorge: elaine, what are you doing? \\n\\nelaine: its disgusting. \\n\\nrula: i dont belive it. i would like you both to leave. \\n\\nelaine: oh fine, i dont like to be around people who are just so irresponsible. \\n\\nrula: get the hell out. \\n\\ngeorge: a plane crash?

(leaving) is it a plane crash? \\n\\ngina: i do not like your toothbrush. there are no bristles. \\n\\njerry: you can say what you want about me but ill be damned if im going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush. \\n\\ngina: it is too small for someone with such a big mouth (kisses kerry). let me ask you. what will you do if martine wakes up? run away like a mouse? \\n\\njerry: no, more like the three stooges at the end of every movie. \\n\\ngina: who are these stooges you speak of? \\n\\njerry: theyre a comedy team. \\n\\ngina: tell me about them. everything. \\n\\njerry: well, theyre three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot. \\n\\ngina: you will show me the stooges? \\n\\njerry: i will show you the stooges. \\n\\ngina: when? \\n\\njerry: well, i dont really know where the stooges are right now but if i locate them you will be the first to know. \\n\\ngina: come, you walk me to a cab. \\n\\njerry: well, uh, i uh, i dont want you to get upset or anything but uh, with martin and all, well maybe its not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had a lot of friends here. \\n\\ngina: youre still afraid. you are not a man. \\n\\njerry: well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet? \\n\\ngina: are you going to walk me to a cab or not? \\n\\njerry: yeah, all right. all right. \\n\\nkramer: you should just eat fruit. \\n\\nnewman: i cant eat fruit. it makes me incontinent. \\n\\nkramer: ???

\\n\\njerry: boy, its a good thing we came. \\n\\ngeorge: could there be a native p0roblem in the caymans? maybe theres native unrest. \\n\\nelaine: hi, i havent eaten in three days. i was wondering how much longer it would be until i get my x-ray. \\n\\nnurse: well call you. \\n\\njerry: george, i want you to promise me something. if im ever in a comma. in the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage. \\n\\ngeorge: how come?

(hitting george) \\n\\nkramer: not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the beach for nude bathing and all of the sports illustrated models went down there. \\n\\njerry: wow! (hitting george) \\n\\nkramer: i was on the next blanket from elle mcpherson \\n\\njerry: oh! (hitting george) \\n\\nkramer: we played backgammon in the nude. \\n\\njerry: oh! (hitting george) \\n\\nkramer: shes a sweet kid. \\n\\njerry: nude backgammon with swimsuit models! \\n\\nkramer: oh, you know what? the second day i was there i stepped on a jellyfish. now it kind of stung my foot. thats probably what rula was trying to warn you about. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, you gotta watch for the jellyfish. \\n\\nkramer: yeah. \\n\\nkramer: whats this? \\n\\njerry: oh, its an invitation to a house warming from martin and gina. \\n\\nkramer: they moved in together? \\n\\njerry: yeah, its some place down in the village. \\n\\nkramer: phew. \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\nelaine: its elaine. \\n\\njerry: all right were coming down. \\n\\nkramer: hey, where ya going? \\n\\njerry: were taking elaine to dinner. shes got to start the fast again. um, you want to go? \\n\\nkramer: um, id like to but a bunch of us from the islands, well be getting together. \\n\\ngeorge: elle mcpherson going to be there? \\n\\nkramer: oh! i got to call her back. \\n\\ngeorge: why even try anymore? there\\'s no sense to it. i\\'m never gonna meet anybody, i should just accept it. \\n\\njerry: oh, yes you will. \\n\\ngeorge: no, i won\\'t. \\n\\njerry: yeah, maybe you won\\'t. \\n\\ngeorge: i mean it\\'s hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like. \\n\\njerry: are my nostrils getting bigger? \\n\\ngeorge: no. why must it be so difficult? why is there all this tension and hostility? why can\\'t i just walk up to a woman on the street and say, \"hi. i\\'m \\n\\ncynthia: there\\'s just no men out there, you know? \\n\\nelaine: i know. \\n\\ncynthia: i mean the problem is that the good ones know they\\'re good. and they know they\\'re in such demand they\\'re just not interested in confining themselves to one person. \\n\\nelaine: i hate the good ones. \\n\\ncynthia: is jerry one of the good ones? \\n\\nelaine: that\\'s a good question, i think he thinks he is. \\n\\ncynthia: well, the mediocre ones are available, but they\\'re so insecure about not being one of the good ones that they\\'re always going, \"well i\\'m not good enough for you, what are you doing with me?\" and eventually i just go, \"you\\'re right.\" \\n\\nelaine: you know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre. \\n\\ncynthia: no, maybe i need somebody who has nothing, somebody who just has to appreciate being with me because he\\'s so desperate. \\n\\ngeorge: i mean it\\'s gotten to the point where i\\'m flirting with operators on the phone. i almost made a date with one. \\n\\njerry: oh, so there\\'s still hope. \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t want hope. hope is killing me. my dream is to become hopeless. when you\\'re hopeless, you don\\'t care, and when you don\\'t care, that indifference makes you attractive. \\n\\njerry: oh, so hopelessness is the key. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s my only hope. \\n\\ncynthia: see, i wouldn\\'t really mind so much, but i feel badly for my mother. i mean, if my mother weren\\'t around, it wouldn\\'t be so bad. but, i\\'m telling you, if i\\'m not married by the time i\\'m forty, i\\'m gonna have to kill her because it\\'s the only fair thing to do. i just couldn\\'t put her through that. \\n\\nelaine: well, at least you\\'re not bitter. \\n\\ncynthia: who says i\\'m not bitter? \\n\\nelaine: aren\\'t you too young to be bitter? \\n\\ncynthia: no, you can be young and bitter, just maybe not as bitter as i\\'m gonna be ten years from now, but i\\'m bitter. anyway, don\\'t tell anyone. \\n\\nelaine: don\\'t worry, your bitterness is safe with me. \\n\\ncynthia: um, order me a piece of cake. i\\'m gonna go throw up. \\n\\njerry: look at my hands. look. filthy from the paper. you know, they should give you a wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints. \\n\\nelaine: so what\\'d you do last night? \\n\\njerry: went out with george, you? \\n\\nelaine: went out with cynthia. \\n\\njerry: how was it? what\\'d you talk about? \\n\\nelaine: well, you know, the usual; the federal reserve, the rainforest. cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get rid of it in one fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. what about you? \\n\\njerry: we brushed on that. actually, george was in rare form. he just can\\'t find anybody. \\n\\nelaine: i know, cynthia too. she\\'s really given up. \\n\\njerry: george too. \\n\\njerry and elaine (together): yeah, right. \\n\\njerry: i\\'ve never fixed anybody up. \\n\\nelaine: uh, me neither and i am not about to start with george. \\n\\njerry: well why wouldn\\'t you start with george? you think she\\'s too good for george? \\n\\nelaine: i didn\\'t say \\'too good\\', did i say \\'too good\\'? \\n\\njerry: well you implied it. \\n\\nelaine: i didn\\'t say it. \\n\\njerry: because if you think she\\'s too good for george, you are dead wrong. dead wrong. who is she? \\n\\nelaine: who is he? \\n\\njerry: he\\'s george! \\n\\nelaine: she\\'s cynthia! \\n\\njerry: so what? \\n\\nelaine: what, you don\\'t think she\\'s beautiful? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know, what\\'s with the eyebrows? \\n\\nelaine: you know what your problem is? your standards are too high. \\n\\njerry: i went out with you. \\n\\nelaine: that\\'s because my standards are too low. and by the way, you know, women kill for eyebrows like that. do you know that? i mean women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they\\'re bald, jerry. bald above the eyes! and then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that. \\n\\njerry: well let me tell you something about george. he is fast. he can run like the wind. and he\\'s strong. i\\'ve seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it. and you wouldn\\'t know it to look at him, but george can bait a hook. \\n\\nelaine: he can really do that? \\n\\njerry: come on, let\\'s do it, i think they\\'ll really get along. \\n\\nelaine: what, are you into this? \\n\\njerry: yeah, come on, it\\'s a good match. \\n\\nelaine: no, wait a minute, wait a minute. they\\'re gonna be telling us how their dates went. are we gonna share that information? \\n\\njerry: naturally. \\n\\nelaine: well, wait a minute, we\\'re gonna tell each other everything, i mean every secret? \\n\\njerry: everything. \\n\\nelaine: what if it worked out? \\n\\njerry (dialing): yeah right. \\n\\ngeorge: out of the question. out of the question! \\n\\njerry: why? \\n\\ngeorge: no! i\\'m not gonna do that! that\\'s one step away from personal ads! and prostitutes! no! no, i am not going down that road! what does she look like? \\n\\njerry: she\\'s good looking. \\n\\ngeorge: how good looking? \\n\\njerry: very good looking. \\n\\ngeorge: really good looking? \\n\\njerry: really very good looking. \\n\\ngeorge: would you take her out? \\n\\njerry: yes, i would take her out. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, you hesitated. \\n\\njerry: what hesitate? i didn\\'t hesitate! \\n\\ngeorge: no, something\\'s off here, you hesitated. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m telling you, she\\'s good looking. \\n\\ngeorge: what about the body, what kind of body? \\n\\njerry: good body, nice body. \\n\\ngeorge: how nice? \\n\\njerry: nice. \\n\\ngeorge: just nice? \\n\\njerry: pretty nice. \\n\\ngeorge: really good? \\n\\njerry: really very nice and good. \\n\\ngeorge: what about personality? \\n\\njerry: good personality. funny. bright. \\n\\ngeorge: smarter than me? i don\\'t want anyone smarter than me. \\n\\njerry: how could she be smarter than you? \\n\\ngeorge: alright, let\\'s see, let\\'s see. what else. what else. oh yeah, what does she do? \\n\\ncynthia: first of all, what does he do? \\n\\nelaine: he was in real estate, um, now, he\\'s not working right now- \\n\\ncynthia: he\\'s not working?! how come he\\'s not working? \\n\\nelaine: well, um, he, he got fired. \\n\\ncynthia: why did he get fired? \\n\\nelaine: uh. why? oh, right. um, well, he tried to poison his boss. \\n\\ncynthia: excuse me? \\n\\nelaine: such a long story, cynthia, seriously, i mean he just had some problems at work. \\n\\ncynthia: is he nuts? \\n\\nelaine: no, no, no, he\\'s a really really funny guy. \\n\\ncynthia: what does he look like? \\n\\nelaine: pardon? \\n\\ncynthia: what does he look like? \\n\\nelaine: um, well, he\\'s got a lot of character in his face. um, he\\'s short. um, he\\'s stocky. \\n\\ncynthia: fat. is that what you\\'re saying, that he\\'s fat? \\n\\nelaine: powerful. he is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up over his head. and um, what else. what else. oh, right. um, well, he\\'s kind of, just kind of losing his hair. \\n\\ncynthia: he\\'s bald? \\n\\nelaine: no! no, no, no, he\\'s not bald. he\\'s balding. \\n\\ncynthia: so he will be bald. \\n\\nelaine: yup. \\n\\ngeorge: what kind of hair? \\n\\njerry: you know, long dark hair. \\n\\ngeorge: flowing? \\n\\njerry: flowing? \\n\\ngeorge: is it flowing? i like flowing, cascading hair. thick lustrous hair is very important to me. \\n\\njerry: \\'thick lustrous hair is very important to me,\\' is that what you said? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, that\\'s right. \\n\\njerry: just clarifying. \\n\\ngeorge: let me ask you this. if you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to get it out? \\n\\njerry: do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to get it out? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'d like to be able to get it out. \\n\\njerry: i think you\\'ll get it out. \\n\\ngeorge: what about the skin? i need a good cheek, i like a good cheek. \\n\\njerry: she\\'s got a fine cheek. \\n\\ngeorge: is there a pinkish hue? \\n\\njerry: a pinkish hue? \\n\\ngeorge: yes, a rosy glow. \\n\\njerry: there\\'s a hue. she\\'s got great eyebrows, women kill to have her eyebrows. \\n\\ngeorge: who cares about eyebrows? is she sweet? i like sweet. but not too sweet, you could throw up from that. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t think you\\'ll throw up. *she* likes to throw up. \\n\\ncynthia: has he ever been married? \\n\\nelaine: no. \\n\\ncynthia: has he been close? \\n\\nelaine: he once spent a weekend with a woman. \\n\\ncynthia: he didn\\'t really try to poison his boss? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, he did. \\n\\ngeorge: we had an incredible phone conversation. we talked for like twenty minutes. i threw away my notes in the middle of the call. you know, i thought she had a great voice timbre. is it timbre or tamber? \\n\\njerry: i think it\\'s tamber. \\n\\ngeorge: why\\'d i think it was timbre? yeah, she could do voiceover commercials, why didn\\'t you tell me about her voice? \\n\\njerry: i didn\\'t notice the voice. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s mellifluous! \\n\\njerry: so, saturday night. \\n\\ngeorge: she had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! it was a great performance. i am unbelievable on the phone. on the date they should just have two phones on the table at the restaurant, done. \\n\\nelaine: hi. \\n\\ngeorge: hey! saturday night! \\n\\nelaine: i know! \\n\\ngeorge: so, what did she say?

\\n\\ngeorge: no. \\n\\njerry: yeah, but-- \\n\\nkramer: yeah yeah! you see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. they play one against the other. you can\\'t let them manipulate you like that. \\n\\njerry: but kramer-- \\n\\nkramer: noh noh noh! i want you guys to shake hands. come on, there are plenty of women out there for all of us, let\\'s go. \\n\\nkramer: yes. you see? isn\\'t that better than fighting? animosity? i mean, you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. oh, by the way george, you know those condoms i gave you? they\\'re defective, don\\'t use them. \\n\\ngeorge: what? \\n\\nkramer: right. \\n\\ngeorge: defective?! \\n\\nkramer: defective. \\n\\ngeorge: (attacking kramer) how could you give me a defective condom?! \\n\\nkramer: i didn\\'t even know they were defective. \\n\\nkramer: didn\\'t even thin you were gonna use them. \\n\\ngeorge: what do you mean you didn\\'t think i wasn\\'t gonna use them?! \\n\\njerry: take it easy, you guys, just spread out! don\\'t worry about it, if anything was wrong she would have called you already! \\n\\ncynthia: i missed my period. \\n\\nelaine: oh my god. \\n\\ncynthia: i am very worried, i am never late. \\n\\nelaine: but he used a condom, right? \\n\\ncynthia: i know, but these things aren\\'t always foolproof. \\n\\nelaine: oh no. \\n\\ncynthia: what? \\n\\nelaine: was it blue? \\n\\ncynthia: yeah. how\\'d you know? \\n\\nelaine: just a hunch. \\n\\njerry: ow! ow! twist off! twist off! twist off! \\n\\njerry: oh, hi. soda?

what type? \\n\\njerry: the type that doesn\\'t return phone calls. i knew we shouldn\\'t have done this, it was a bad idea in the first place, i told you! \\n\\nelaine: you told me? you pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea! \\n\\njerry: i was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend. \\n\\nelaine: she\\'s not bitter! \\n\\njerry: well, bitter\\'s a judgement call, but she\\'s twisted! \\n\\nelaine: twisted? god, i did you a favor. \\n\\njerry: i thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you\\'re keeping from me? \\n\\nelaine: are you calling me a liar? \\n\\njerry: i\\'m calling you one if you are one, are you a liar? \\n\\nelaine: are you? \\n\\njerry: get your finger out of my face. \\n\\nelaine: you get yours out, i was here first! \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t care. \\n\\nelaine: get it out! \\n\\nkramer: hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! come on, break it up! what\\'s the matter with you? now don\\'t you two see that you\\'re in love with each other? i mean, why can\\'t you face that already? you\\'re running around out there looking for something that\\'s not even there, when everything that you dream of is right here, right here in front of you. now why can\\'t you admit that? by the way, when you see george give him these, these\\'ll work. \\n\\nelaine: i knew those condoms were defective! \\n\\njerry: how did you know they were defective?! \\n\\nelaine: because! because she missed her period! \\n\\ngeorge: she missed her period? oh my god. i can\\'t believe it! i\\'m a father! i did it! my boys can swim! i can do it! i can do it! \\n\\ncynthia: so he shows up. he\\'s all out of breath. he\\'s disheveled. and he tells me that no matter what happens, whatever i decide is fine with him and that i could depend on him, and that he would be there to support me in whatever way i need. elaine, i was speechless. \\n\\nelaine: wow. wow. you see? you think you know somebody. \\n\\ncynthia: i said to him, \"i really appreciate this, but i just got my period.\" and so, i asked him to come in, he came in-- \\n\\nelaine: hi! \\n\\ngeorge: sorry, we\\'re a little late. we got so hung up in traffic. \\n\\nelaine: what happened?

... \\n\\nkeith: (to jerry) do you perform anywhere in new york right now? \\n\\njerry: i\\'m performing in this club on the east side. you should come in. \\n\\ngeorge: but if you think about it...26 teams, 162 games a season, you\\'d think eventually an entire team would get wiped out. \\n\\nkeith: you know, i live on the east side. \\n\\njerry: i\\'ll tell you what, i\\'ll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go. \\n\\nkeith: or maybe just to get together for a cup of coffee \\n\\njerry: oh. that would be great. \\n\\ngeorge: uh, it\\'s only a matter of time. \\n\\nkeith: who\\'s this chucker?

\\n\\njerry: oh, they don\\'t have phones out of town? why do(?) people say they\\'re too busy. too busy. pick up a phone!! it takes two minutes. how can you be too busy? \\n\\nelaine: why don\\'t you just go ahead and call him? \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t call here, it\\'s a coffee shop. i mean what am i going to say to him? \\n\\nelaine: just ask him if he wants a to get together. \\n\\njerry: for what dinner? \\n\\nelaine: dinner\\'s good. \\n\\njerry: don\\'t you think that\\'s coming on a little too strong?

\\n\\nnewman: why? i\\'ll tell you why... \\n\\nkramer: let me tell it .. \\n\\nnewman: no, you can\\'t tell it .. \\n\\nkramer: you always tell it .. \\n\\nnewman: all right, tell it. \\n\\nkramer: ja ja ja - just tell it \\n\\nnewman: june 14, 1987.... mets phillies. we\\'re enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial hernandez error to a five run phillies ninth. cost the mets the game. \\n\\nkramer: our day was ruined. there was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player\\'s parking lot. now we\\'re coming down the ramp ... [cut to film of the day - like the zabruter film - with the umbrella man and everything - oh so brilliant parody!!!] ... newman was in front of me. keith was coming toward us, as he passes newman turns and says, \" nice game pretty boy.\". keith continued past us up the ramp. \\n\\nnewman: a second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward. \\n\\nelaine: what was it? \\n\\nkramer: he spit on us.... and i screamed out, \"i\\'m hit!\" \\n\\nnewman: then i turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me. \\n\\nelaine: wow! what a story. \\n\\njerry: unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. allow me to reconstruct this if i may for miss benes as i\\'ve heard this story a number of times. \\n\\njerry: newman, kramer, if you\\'ll indulge me. according to your story keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. the spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking newman between the third and forth rib. the spit then cam off the rib turned and hit newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. the spit then splashed off the wrist, pauses in mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on newman\\'s left thigh. that is one magic luggie. \\n\\nnewman: well that\\'s the way it happened. \\n\\njerry: what happened to your head when you got hit? \\n\\nkramer: well. uh, well my head went back and to the left \\n\\njerry: again \\n\\nkramer: back and to the left \\n\\njerry: back and to the left back and to the left \\n\\nelaine: so, what are you saying? \\n\\njerry: i am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. if the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward. \\n\\nelaine: so the spit could have only come from the front and to the right. \\n\\njerry: but that is not what they would have you believe. \\n\\nnewman: i\\'m leavin\\'. jerry\\'s a nut. (exits) \\n\\nkramer: wait, wait, (exits) \\n\\njerry: the sad thing is we may never know the real truth. \\n\\ngeorge: (frantically) did anybody call here asking for vandelay industries? \\n\\njerry: no. what happened to you? \\n\\ngeorge: now, listen closely. i was at the unemployment office and i told them that i was very close to getting a job with vandelay industries and i gave them your phone number. so, when now when the phone rings you\\'ve got to answer \"vandelay industries\". \\n\\njerry: i\\'m vandelay industries? \\n\\ngeorge: right. \\n\\njerry: and what is that? \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'re in latex \\n\\njerry: latex? and what do i do with latex? \\n\\ngeorge: ya manufacture it. \\n\\nelaine: here in this little apartment? \\n\\njerry: and what do i say about you? \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'re considering hiring me for your latex salesman. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m going to hire you as my latex salesman? \\n\\ngeorge: right. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t think so. why would i do that? \\n\\ngeorge: because i asked you to. \\n\\njerry: if you think i\\'m looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around, you can forget it. i have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff. \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s keith. \\n\\njerry: all right we\\'re coming down. \\n\\ngeorge: keith hernandez? \\n\\njerry: yeah, come on elaine, lets go. \\n\\ngeorge: where are you goin? \\n\\nelaine: he\\'s giving me a ride you know there had to have been a second spitter. but who was it? who had the motive? \\n\\njerry: that\\'s what i\\'ve been trying to figure out the past five years. \\n\\ngeorge: what the hell are you two talking about? (all exit) \\n\\njerry: well that was really fun, thanks. \\n\\nkeith: yeah, it really was. \\n\\njerry(mind): should i shake his hand? \\n\\njerry: well, ... \\n\\nkeith: uh, do you want to catch a movie this weekend? have you seen jfk? \\n\\njerry: no, i haven\\'t. \\n\\njerry(mind): this weekend. wow! \\n\\njerry: sure, that would be great. \\n\\njerry(mind): damn, i was too overanxious, he must have noticed that. \\n\\njerry: i mean, ... if you want to. \\n\\nkeith: well, how about this friday? \\n\\njerry: yeah, friday\\'s okay. \\n\\njerry(mind): go ahead shake his hand. you\\'re jerry seinfeld. you\\'ve been on the tonight show. \\n\\njerry: well, good night [holds hand out and shakes hand] \\n\\nkeith: goodnight. oh, jer, by the way, the woman we gave a ride to earlier tonight, \\n\\njerry: elaine? \\n\\nkeith: yeah. what\\'s her story? \\n\\njerry: uh, i don\\'t know, we used to go out. \\n\\nkeith: would you mind if i gave her a call? \\n\\njerry: for a date? \\n\\nkeith: yeah. \\n\\njerry: oh, no, uh, go ahead. you got a pen? \\n\\nkeith: you sure you don\\'t mind? \\n\\njerry: ....

i thought that george went to pick him up. \\n\\nelaine: he did. \\n\\nkramer: well then why would they take a limo from the airport? \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t know. \\n\\nkramer: that\\'s pretty strange. did he say anything else? \\n\\nelaine: yeah. he said, um, he said it\\'s really important that we call them o\\'brien and murphy. \\n\\nkramer: o\\'brien. why would he want to be called o\\'brien? \\n\\ngeorge: ...and the jews steal our money through their zionist occupied government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white minority communities. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re not going to open with that, are you? \\n\\neva: what was that you said about the myth of the holocaust? \\n\\ngeorge: i said so many things. \\n\\ngeorge: they\\'re shooting! they\\'re shooting! \\n\\ntim: (pulling out a gun) alright, get down! \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s really very nice of you, eva. thank you. \\n\\neva: but of course you know i would. i would do anything for you. anything. \\n\\ntim: nothing to worry about, it was just a flat tire. but rest assured, we\\'re prepared to handle anything that might come up. \\n\\njerry: nice looking lugar. \\n\\njodi: i\\'m standing in front of the paramount adjacent to madison square garden where a growing number of vociferous and angry demonstrators are gathering to protest the very first public appearance of donald o\\'brien, the leader of the midwestern regional chapter of the aryan union, and reputed to be their most charismatic spokesman. the reclusive mr. o\\'brien is an advocate of the violent overthrow of the government. he has openly professed a deep admiration of adolf hitler. even david duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist. there is a full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport. sources tell me he is in route and should be arriving momentarily. police have set up barricades, but quite frankly bill and jean, i don\\'t think they\\'re any match for the emotional fuse that has been lit here tonight. reporting from the paramount, i\\'m jodi baskerville, back to you in the studio. \\n\\nkramer: something\\'s very strange. george goes to the airport to pick up jerry. they come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called o\\'brien and murphy? o\\'brien. o\\'brien, why o\\'brien? \\n\\ndan: elaine? \\n\\nelaine: dan! oh, hi dan, how are you? \\n\\ndan: good. \\n\\nelaine: um, oh, this is um, kramer. \\n\\ndan: oh, kramer? \\n\\nelaine: what\\'s going on? \\n\\ndan: oh, we\\'re heading down to protest this big neo-nazi rally. the head of the aryan union is speaking, he\\'s in from chicago. you should come. \\n\\nelaine: oh, can\\'t, i\\'m going to the knicks-bulls game. \\n\\ndan: oh, well that\\'s where the rally is. the paramount, right next door. \\n\\nelaine: oh, well, maybe we\\'ll run into you. \\n\\ndan: yeah, yeah ok. it\\'s really gonna be something, this is the first time he\\'s ever appeared in public, no one even knows what he looks like. \\n\\nkramer: who? \\n\\ndan: the head of the aryan union; o\\'brien. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s taking him so long out there? \\n\\ngeorge: didja see the way she was looking at me? \\n\\njerry: she\\'s a nazi, george. a nazi! \\n\\ngeorge: i know, i know. kind of a cute nazi though. \\n\\njerry: well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do? \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t know. \\n\\njerry: let\\'s just make a run for it. \\n\\ngeorge: i can\\'t run, i have a bad hamstring. \\n\\njerry: how\\'d that happen? \\n\\ngeorge: i hurt it in a hotel room. you know where they tuck the covers in real tight in those hotel rooms? i can\\'t sleep like that so i tried to kick it out and i pulled it. \\n\\njerry: i know, why do they make that bed so tight? you gotta sleep with your feet like that. \\n\\ngeorge: for a mental patient. wait a minute, the phone, we\\'ll call the police. \\n\\ngeorge: 9... 1... 1. she said she\\'d do anything. hello, police? uh, yeah listen, we\\'re in the back of a limo in queens-- \\n\\ngeorge: --astroturf? you know who\\'s responsible for that, don\\'t you?! the jews! ah, the jews hate grass. they always have, they always will. \\n\\ntim: we\\'ll be ready in a minute. \\n\\ngeorge: would you excuse us for a minute tim boy, we\\'re kind of in the middle of something. \\n\\ntim: with all due respect, mr. o\\'brien, we\\'re just about to leave. \\n\\ngeorge: tim, who\\'s the head of the aryan union, you or me? \\n\\ntim: you are. \\n\\ngeorge: and who\\'s responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular again? \\n\\ntim: you are. \\n\\ngeorge: good. i think you forgot something. \\n\\ntim: i\\'m sorry. \\n\\ngeorge: good. now get out. \\n\\ngeorge: okay, what are we gonna do? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know. \\n\\ngeorge: alright, how\\'s this? we wait till we get to your street corner, we see elaine and kramer then we get out. they can\\'t shoot us in the city. \\n\\njerry: nah. no one\\'s ever been shot in the city. \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m telling you, something\\'s going on. i can feel it, sense it. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m sure he was just joking around. \\n\\nkramer: oh no no no, this is no joke. o\\'brien\\'s coming in from chicago, jerry\\'s in a limo, says he\\'s o\\'brien? that\\'s not funny. oh my god. yes. yes! \\n\\nelaine: what is it? \\n\\nkramer: don\\'t you see? there\\'s always been something very strange about jerry, always so clean and organized. do i have to spell it out for you? the limo? the name? the rally at madison square garden? jerry, o\\'brien are the same person. jerry is the leader of the aryan union! \\n\\nelaine: jerry\\'s a nazi?! \\n\\nkramer: i can\\'t believe i didn\\'t see it. \\n\\nelaine: listen, you idiot! just calm down! i know jerry, he\\'s not a nazi. \\n\\nkramer: you don\\'t think so. \\n\\nelaine: no, he\\'s just neat. \\n\\ntim: you know it\\'s funny. you don\\'t look like an o\\'brien. \\n\\ngeorge: me?? \\n\\ntim: and you really don\\'t look like a murphy. \\n\\njerry: i may not look like a murphy but i act like a murphy. \\n\\ngeorge: he\\'s extremely murphy. he\\'s murphy to a fault. \\n\\ntim: where are you from? \\n\\njerry: dublin. originally. parents came over here when i was eighteen. cereal famine. couldn\\'t get a bowl anywhere. bad. \\'tis a beautiful country though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat. \\n\\ntim: sounds more like scottish. \\n\\njerry: we were right on the border. \\n\\nkramer: maybe he\\'s with the company. \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\nkramer: the cia! maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within. \\n\\nelaine: what about his comedy act? \\n\\nkramer: that\\'s the perfect cover! all that time on the road? look jerry, he\\'s too normal to be a comedian. these comedians, they\\'re sick, neurotic people. \\n\\nelaine: what about george? \\n\\nkramer: what about him, he\\'s part of it. his whole personality is a disguise. no real person can act the way he does. elaine, i\\'m telling you they\\'re with the organization. they\\'re all part of it. he\\'s in there with helms and hunt and liddy, that whole crowd. george and jerry, they probably know who killed kennedy! \\n\\nelaine: i\\'ll bet they were even in on it. \\n\\nkramer: alright, what are we gonna do? i\\'m not gonna let him hurt you. (grabs and hugs elaine tightly) i\\'m not gonna. \\n\\nelaine: kramer, you\\'re hurting me! \\n\\ngeorge: those are my friends i was telling you about. we\\'re gonna talk to them, pull over. \\n\\nelaine: get off of me!! \\n\\nkramer: o\\'brien. \\n\\nman #1: o\\'brien? is that him? \\n\\nman #2: yeah, that\\'s him. \\n\\nman #3: look there\\'s o\\'brien! \\n\\nman #4: filthy nazi bastard! \\n\\nall four men: let\\'s get him!! \\n\\ngeorge: what do i do?! what do i do?! \\n\\njerry: get in the car! get in the car! \\n\\nkramer: (pointing to jerry) o\\'brien. long time no see. how\\'s tricks, murphy? \\n\\ntim: why did you call him o\\'brien and him murphy? \\n\\njerry: no, he was talking to me, he\\'s cross-eyed. \\n\\nelaine: it could be very confusing. \\n\\nkramer: yeah? eva? \\n\\neva: it\\'s for me. (takes phone) hello? (cups receiver) it\\'s o\\'brien. \\n\\nkramer: o\\'brien? well that\\'s weird. \\n\\neva: (gun drawn) who are you? \\n\\njodi: a limousine has just pulled up it\\'s being surrounded by a huge group of protestors, this has the makings of a very ugly scene. \\n\\njodi: they are banging on the car, trying to flip it over. the police seem unable or unwilling to control the crowd, i would imagine mr. o\\'brien must be having some very grave doubts if he made the right choice for his first public appearance. \\n\\neva: get out!! \\n\\nelaine: look, it\\'s dan! hi dan! \\n\\ndan: elaine? \\n\\nelaine: hey! \\n\\ngeorge: i am not o\\'brien! i am not o\\'brien! i\\'m not o\\'brien! ask anyone! jerry?! jerry?!! \\n\\nelaine: you know it\\'s bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the speaker? \\n\\njerry: it\\'s safer! plus it\\'s more annoying to the other person. \\n\\njerry: oh look at this guy. \\n\\nelaine: what\\'s goin\\' on? \\n\\njerry: oh there\\'s a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask permission. yes. go ahead. get in, get in. \\n\\nelaine: did you get a thank you wave? \\n\\njerry: no, nothing. how could you not give a thank you wave? hey buddy! where\\'s my thank you wave? \\n\\njerry: give me that wave! \\n\\nelaine: jerry, are you free on friday? \\n\\njerry: yeah, i\\'m free, why? \\n\\nelaine: ah, god, i bumped into robin sandusky today, she asked me to have dinner with her and her husband. \\n\\njerry: oh my god! you won\\'t believe what i just saw! a car just bashed into a parked car, and sped off, right on my block! \\n\\nelaine: you gotta follow that car! \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nelaine: you can\\'t let him get away with that! \\n\\njerry: elaine, the guy could be dangerous. \\n\\nelaine: what are you, yellow? \\n\\njerry: i\\'m not yella. (in a cowboy voice) \\n\\nelaine: jerry, if you don\\'t follow him, you\\'re yella. \\n\\njerry: wait, he stopped, he\\'s parking. \\n\\nelaine: what? what? i can\\'t hear you. jerry? \\n\\njerry: uh, excuse me, uh, i was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks back, and i, i couldn\\'t help, uh, maybe you didn\\'t realize, uh, i witnessed that, uh, um, you\\'re tire\\'s a little low. that can affect the performance of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion steering. \\n\\njerry: so i wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her. \\n\\ngeorge: boy! what a story! i\\'m speechless. speechless. i have no speech. \\n\\njerry: you know, i really liked her. we talked. we flirted. and when she left, she reached out and touched my arm. \\n\\njerry: he, he, he. (simulating her feminine laugh) \\n\\ngeorge: i love when they touch your arm. i can\\'t get enough of that. why is that? \\n\\njerry: let\\'s not even analyze it. \\n\\ngeorge: so you didn\\'t turn her in? \\n\\njerry: i wanted to but i couldn\\'t go through with it. \\n\\ngeorge: gonna see her again? \\n\\njerry: friday night. \\n\\njerry: yep. \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s me! \\n\\njerry: come on up. \\n\\njerry: by the way, elaine does not need to know about anything. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, hey, hey! i dig. \\n\\njerry: oh, you dig? \\n\\ngeorge: yes! i see enormous potential here. \\n\\njerry: why? \\n\\ngeorge: because great couples always have a great story about how they met. that\\'s why i\\'ve never been in a long term relationship. i\\'ve never had a good meeting story. \\n\\njerry: i wonder if i\\'m nuts for pursuing this woman at all. \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t think so. \\n\\njerry: look, she slammed into a parked car! she took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger, then she sped off like a criminal! \\n\\njerry: on the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again? you scratch one car and you\\'re forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?! \\n\\njerry: what am i drinking, milk? \\n\\nelaine: hey! \\n\\njerry: hi. \\n\\nelaine: sweater. \\n\\njerry: thank you. \\n\\nelaine: so? what happened? \\n\\njerry: with that? \\n\\nelaine: with the car! \\n\\njerry: what car? \\n\\nelaine: the hit and run! \\n\\njerry: oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and run. well. actually, the guy went into queens. \\n\\nelaine: queens?! you followed him over the bridge? \\n\\njerry: over the bridge. (making a pointing motion with his hand) \\n\\ngeorge: oh, well i didn\\'t know you went into queens jerry. \\n\\njerry: yeah, queens. \\n\\nelaine: so? then what? \\n\\njerry: so he gets out of the car, i say, \"hey buddy! i saw you hit that car!\" so he says to me, \"what are ya gonna do about it?\" \\n\\njerry: so i said to him, \"whatever\\'s necessary.\" \\n\\nelaine: i am speechless. i am without speech. \\n\\ngeorge: tell her about the shoving. \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nelaine: what shoving?! \\n\\njerry: oh, it was nothing. \\n\\ngeorge: no! tell her. \\n\\njerry: well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the car. so i went into a karate stance. (jerry assumes karate position and does two punches) \\n\\nelaine: you know karate?? \\n\\njerry: i know a little. \\n\\nelaine: well, this is so, amazing to me! jerry what did do? \\n\\njerry: he backed off. pretty pathetic actually. \\n\\nkramer: hey! (group does likewise) \\n\\nelaine: did you tell kramer? \\n\\njerry: ah, nah! (waving his hand and walking away) \\n\\nkramer: what? what? what? tell me. \\n\\nelaine: jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him. \\n\\nkramer: good for you! what kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that? you know those people, you know they\\'re mentally disturbed. (pointing a finger at jerry) \\n\\nkramer: they should be sent to australia. \\n\\njerry: australia? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, yeah, that\\'s where england used to send their convicts. \\n\\njerry: but not anymore. \\n\\nkramer: no. \\n\\nelaine: hey kramer, kramer! \\n\\nkramer: yeah? \\n\\nelaine: what happened to you right here? (she pointing to her forehead) \\n\\nkramer: i don\\'t know! \\n\\nkramer: you know i was watching entertainment tonight, and uh, suddenly i got dizzy. and the next thing i know i hit my head on the coffee table. \\n\\nelaine: well, that is, that is strange. \\n\\nkramer: yep. (mumbles off) \\n\\nelaine: alright, oh jerry, we\\'re still on for friday night, right? \\n\\njerry: oh friday, i can\\'t, i\\'m sorry, i have a date. \\n\\nelaine: but last night you said you were free! (sounding very disappointed) \\n\\njerry: we just met. \\n\\nkramer: maybe it was a reaction to the sardines. \\n\\nelaine: but i, i can\\'t go alone! \\n\\njerry: ask george to go with you. \\n\\nelaine: george, come on! i\\'ll pay for you. \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'ll pay? i\\'m there. \\n\\njerry: why do you even need anybody? \\n\\nelaine: because i hate being at a table alone, with a married couple. talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. they\\'re always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine. you know, i have a very exciting life. it\\'s very exciting. (as she\\'s closing the door to leave) \\n\\nrobin: you went out with a bullfighter? \\n\\nelaine: yes, well, an ex-bullfighter now. \\n\\nmichael: wow. \\n\\nrobin: what was his name? \\n\\nelaine: his name? name, um, his name was uh, uh, eduardo carochio. \\n\\ngeorge: pass the salt please. \\n\\nrobin: where did you meet him? \\n\\nelaine: um, actually, i met him in switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is that the word they use? fighting? because they don\\'t really fight the bull, they avoid fighting the bull. \\n\\ngeorge: bread. \\n\\nelaine: i just love meeting new people. you know that\\'s how you really do learn about life. \\n\\ngeorge: god bless you. \\n\\nrobin: thank you. \\n\\ngeorge: i wasn\\'t going to say anything, but then i could see that he wasn\\'t going to open his mouth. (chuckles) \\n\\nwoman: you know who\\'s a good actor? anthony quinn. \\n\\njerry: oh, anthony quinn, fine actor. but from what i understand, not a very good driver. hits everything on the road. but always leaves a note. \\n\\nwoman: did you ever see zorba the greek? \\n\\njerry: excellent film. in fact quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car. \\n\\nwoman: come here. (moves in for a kiss) \\n\\ngeorge: really, i was, i was only kidding around. \\n\\nrobin: he was only joking michael. \\n\\nmichael: you think you\\'re so damn special because you say \\'god bless you\\'? \\n\\ngeorge: no, no, i don\\'t think i\\'m special. my mother always said i\\'m not special. \\n\\nrobin: he was only joking michael! sorry. \\n\\nmichael: all right! take his side! \\n\\nrobin: i am not taking his side. \\n\\nmichael: well who\\'s side are you taking?! \\n\\nrobin: well i\\'m not taking your side! \\n\\njerry: kirk douglas. now there\\'s another very bad driver. but he\\'s such an unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn\\'t even leave a note. he sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license, registration, and apologize. \\n\\ngeorge: i said \\'god bless you\\'. was that so wrong? \\n\\njerry: the question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his \\'god bless you\\'? because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal. \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s me. \\n\\njerry: come on up. \\n\\ngeorge: yes, yes, i definitely waited. but let me say this once he passes on that option, that \\'god bless you\\' is up for grabs. \\n\\njerry: no argument. unless, she\\'s one of these multiple sneezers, and he\\'s holding his \\'god bless you\\' in abeyance, until she completes the series. \\n\\ngeorge: well i don\\'t think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed again later, and it was also a single. \\n\\njerry: what if she\\'s having an off night? \\n\\nelaine: hi! \\n\\njerry: hi. \\n\\nelaine: well! if it isn\\'t mister gesuntheit! \\n\\ngeorge: oh ya, like there\\'s something wrong with saying \\'god bless you\\'. i was raised to say \\'god bless you\\'. \\n\\ngeorge: ah, shut up. \\n\\nelaine: what does it mean anyway? \\'god bless you\\'. it\\'s a stupid \\'stuperstition\\'. \\n\\njerry: a stupid what? \\n\\nelaine: whatever. \\n\\njerry: you know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, you shouldn\\'t say \\'god bless you\\', you should say, \\'you\\'re soo good lookin\\'\\'. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, yeah, that\\'s better than \\'god bless you\\'. anyway, she left a message on my machine, she wants you to call her. \\n\\ngeorge: who? \\n\\nelaine: robin! \\n\\ngeorge: why?! \\n\\nelaine: well i assumed she called to apologize, that\\'s why she called me. \\n\\njerry: entertainment tonight\\'s on. \\n\\ngeorge: where\\'s the remote phone? \\n\\njerry: bedroom. \\n\\nelaine: hey, grab jerry\\'s sweater for me, would you? \\n\\njerry: what\\'s it like out? \\n\\nelaine: chilly out. \\n\\njerry: can i take a sweater? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to. \\n\\njerry: scarf? \\n\\nelaine: nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s the matter? what\\'s going on? \\n\\nkramer: what happened?! \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\nkramer: i think i hit my head again! \\n\\njerry: what is wrong?! \\n\\nelaine: hey, hey, wait a minute! let me ask you something. kramer, the last time you hit your head, was mary hart on tv? \\n\\nkramer: yeah. \\n\\nelaine: that is it! \\n\\nkramer: what? \\n\\nelaine: that is it! mary hart\\'s voice, don\\'t you see? there\\'s something about mary hart\\'s voice that\\'s giving you seizures. just like, just like, just like that woman in albany! \\n\\nkramer: mary hart! \\n\\ngeorge: god. \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\ngeorge: well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get together wednesday afternoon. \\n\\njerry: get together? \\n\\ngeorge: maybe she just wants to talk to me? \\n\\nelaine: married women don\\'t \\'get together\\'. they have affairs. \\n\\ngeorge: oh my god, an affair. that\\'s so adult. it\\'s like with stockings and martinis, and william holden. on the other hand it probably wouldn\\'t cost me any money. \\n\\nelaine: are you actually considering this? \\n\\ngeorge: i can\\'t have an affair with a married woman, that\\'s despicable! \\n\\nelaine: yeah, it\\'s like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note. \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\nkramer: hey, you know who owns that car? \\n\\njerry: what car? \\n\\nkramer: the one that was hit a couple of nights ago. \\n\\njerry: yeah who? \\n\\nkramer: that blond across the street. you know the one with the long ponytail, she wears those blue sweatpants. \\n\\njerry: the blond with the blue sweatpants! yeah, i think i\\'ve seen her. \\n\\nelaine: well i\\'ve got to get going. i\\'m meeting a guy with grey sweatpants. \\n\\nkramer: wait, wait, wait, how do you know it\\'s not john tesh? \\n\\njerry: the blond with the blue sweatpants! \\n\\ngeorge: well, who is she? \\n\\njerry: i\\'ve had a crush on this woman for year! i\\'ve always been afraid to approach her! she looks like she belongs on one of these hallmark cards. \\n\\ngeorge: oh right, right! the blue sweatpants! gees, it\\'s too bad you can\\'t say anything because of angela. \\n\\njerry: oh yeah. too bad. angela. lousy thug. i mean what kind of sick person does something like that? that woman belongs in prison! i mean, i actually owe it to society to do something about this! i can\\'t sit by and allow this to go on. it\\'s a moral issue is what it is! \\n\\ngeorge: you can\\'t compromise your principles! \\n\\njerry: how am i going to live with myself?! \\n\\ngeorge: can\\'t live! \\n\\njerry: i\\'m not religious, but i certainly know where to draw the line! \\n\\ngeorge: this country needs more people like you! \\n\\njerry: don\\'t sell yourself short saying \\'god bless you\\' to every tom, dick and harry in great personal risk. \\n\\ngeorge: i believe strongly in that as you know. \\n\\njerry: there should be more people like us. \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s why the world\\'s in the shape it\\'s in. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re telling me. \\n\\njerry: anyway, i just wanted you to know, that i\\'m going to do everything i can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that. \\n\\nbecky: well god bless you. \\n\\njerry: thank you very much. \\n\\ngeorge: oh my god. i must be crazy. what have i done? \\n\\nrobin: oh no, what\\'s wrong? \\n\\ngeorge: what\\'s wrong? i\\'ll tell you what\\'s wrong. i just committed adultery! \\n\\nrobin: you didn\\'t commit adultery, i did. \\n\\ngeorge: oh yeah. \\n\\nrobin: if i didn\\'t do it with you, i would have done it with someone else. \\n\\ngeorge: well, i wouldn\\'t want you to do that. you know there\\'s a lot of losers out there. \\n\\nrobin: maybe even someone who didn\\'t say \\'god bless you\\'. \\n\\ngeorge: well, that\\'s a given. \\n\\nrobin: in three years with michael, not one \\'god bless you\\'. \\n\\ngeorge: must be hell living in that house. \\n\\nmichael: hi, it\\'s michael. \\n\\nelaine: hi, michael! \\n\\nmichael: is robin there? \\n\\nelaine: robin? no, why? \\n\\nmichael: uh, she said she was going to be with you. \\n\\nelaine: no i haven\\'t spoken to her all day-uh, yeah right, um, as a matter of fact, um, she was here, and she uh, left a note, but i wasn\\'t here, but i have the note, uh, right here. \\n\\nmichael: if she\\'s not with you, then where is she? \\n\\nelaine: well i, i don\\'t know. \\n\\nmichael: is she with your bald friend from the other night?! \\n\\nelaine: no, no, come on michael! \\n\\nmichael: he\\'s finished! i\\'m going to sew his ass to his face! i\\'m going to twist his neck so hard his lips will be his eyebrows! i\\'m going to break his joints, and reattach them! \\n\\nelaine: you\\'re soo good lookin\\'. \\n\\nangela: now you listen to me, suck face! you tell anybody, anything, and i will carve my initials in your brain tissue! \\n\\njerry: let me rephra- \\n\\nangela: i\\'ll bash your skull into a vegematic like a bad cabbage, and i\\'ll have a party on your head! \\n\\njerry: hi elaine, this is angela. \\n\\nangela: i\\'ll pluck all your body hairs out with my teeth! \\n\\njerry: well i think i get the gist of it. \\n\\nangela: so you don\\'t say anything to anybody about me hitting that car! \\n\\njerry: what car? \\n\\nangela: good. i\\'m glad we understand each other. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s not complicated. \\n\\nelaine: very nice meeting you! \\n\\nelaine: come on up. \\n\\nelaine: well, well, well, mr. seinfeld! that must have been so frightening! when you confronted that guy, in queens! now, let\\'s just see if i\\'ve got this scenario right. \\n\\njerry: alright elaine. \\n\\nelaine: no, no, no, no, no. because i\\'m picturing \\'french connection\\', kind of thing. you know?

(to kramer) thanks! real good! jerry! first of all, i think you completely misunderstood what i said. i meant it in a complementary way. i mean, you know when people say, \\'he\\'s bad\\', it really means he\\'s good, sort of thing? you know, slang. \\n\\njerry: use it in a sentence. \\n\\nmike: man, that michael jordan is so phony. (to kramer) why\\'d you tell him?!? \\n\\nkramer: he begged me. \\n\\nmike: he begged you?! \\n\\njerry: alright, come on. who wants to watch the fight? \\n\\ncop #1: okay, who\\'s cars are these? let\\'s move \\'em. let\\'s go. \\n\\ngeorge: officer, could i just explain something to you? \\n\\ncop #1: hey. let\\'s go or i\\'m gonna write both of you a ticket in about two minutes. \\n\\ngeorge: officer, he can\\'t pull in head first. \\n\\nmike: officer, he backed up from down the street. he was double-parked, he was \\n\\ncop #1: alright, you move your car. it\\'s his space, you can\\'t go in head \\n\\ncop #2: wait a second. why can\\'t he go in head first? he said the guy was just sitting over there. \\n\\ncop #1: what are you talking about? this guy was here first. \\n\\ncop #2: but he didn\\'t take it. \\n\\ncop #1: hey, it\\'s his space. \\n\\ncop #2: no, it\\'s his space. \\n\\ngeorge: well, you\\'re gonna have to go to the bathroom! \\n\\nmike: well, you\\'re gonna have to go to work! \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t have a job! \\n\\nmike: neither do i! \\n\\nreferee: seven... eight... nine... ten. *ding* \\n\\njerry\\'s stand-up: so, i fly a lot. i like planes. i was on a plane the other day and i was wondering - are there keys to the plane? do they need keys to start the plane? maybe that\\'s what those delays on the ground are sometimes. when you\\'re just sitting there at the gate, maybe the pilot\\'s just up there in the cockpit going (mimics looking for keys) \"oh, i don\\'t believe this. oh my god...i did it again.\" they tell you it\\'s something mechanical, because they don\\'t want to come on the pa system...\"ladies and gentlemen, we\\'re going to be delayed here on the ground for a little while, i uh...oh god, this is so embarrassing...i - i left the keys to the plane in my apartment.\" you see the technicians all running underneath the plane; you think they\\'re servicing it, but they\\'re actually looking for the magnet \"hide-a-key\" under the wing...\"maybe he left it up there somewhere...\" \\n\\nopening scene: jerry\\'s apartment in the middle of the night. jerry comes out of his room. we hear his thoughts. \\n\\njerry\\'s brain: what is it about sleep that makes you so thirsty? do dreams require liquid? it\\'s not like i\\'m running a marathon, i\\'m just lying there. \\n\\njerry\\'s brain: what the hell...? why is the door open? \\n\\njerry: kramer, what are you doing here!? \\n\\nkramer: jerry, now calm down, it\\'s okay. i\\'m sorry. i didn\\'t want to wake you up! y\\'know, i was watching \"thirty seconds over tokyo,\" and i - y\\'know, i wanted to get some popcorn, and i, uh...i used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper. \\n\\njerry: you scared me! \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s just me. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s enough! \\n\\nkramer: forgot the popper... (goes to the kitchen, grabs the popper, drops the lid, juggles it around, then exits.) \\n\\njerry (from outside the door): c\\'mon...c\\'mon... \\n\\njerry: kramer! what are you doing?! \\n\\nkramer: what does it look like i\\'m doing? what? \\n\\njerry: get out! get out of the bathroom, i gotta go! \\n\\nkramer: alright, alright... \\n\\njerry: c\\'mon! \\n\\nkramer: sorry. \\n\\njerry: move it! move it! get going! \\n\\nkramer: my drain\\'s all clogged up! (comes out of the bathroom in a towel, covered in soap suds.) \\n\\njerry (from inside the bathroom): is that my towel? \\n\\ngirlfriend: i\\'m really happy the movie was sold out. \\n\\njerry: hey, did you ever pretend there\\'s like, murderers chasing you, and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment? \\n\\ngirlfriend: i\\'m from witchita, so... \\n\\njerry: oh. i see. there he is! (pretends the murderers are coming.) \\n\\ngirlfriend: hurry, jerry! he\\'s coming! hurry! \\n\\njerry: the murderers! (jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.) \\n\\ngirlfriend: that was close! \\n\\njerry: did you see the look on that guy\\'s face? \\n\\ngirlfriend: you were so fast with those keys. (they prepare to kiss, but are interrupted by kramer and his girlfriend coming out of jerry\\'s bedroom, laughing and horsing around.) \\n\\njerry: kramer! what the hell are you doing here?! \\n\\nkramer: hey, jerry! how are ya? i thought you were going to the movies. \\n\\njerry: all right, that\\'s it. hand \\'em over. \\n\\nkramer: what? \\n\\njerry: what, you know what, the keys. i want the keys. you\\'ve lost your key privileges. \\n\\nkramer: oh, come on! \\n\\njerry: no, come on! \\n\\nkramer: what, what, i thought you went to the movies! \\n\\njerry: it was sold out! \\n\\nkramer: now how was i supposed to know it was going to be sold out? \\n\\njerry: that\\'s the point. \\n\\nkramer: what point? \\n\\njerry: just, look, just give the keys. \\n\\nkramer: just give me another chance! \\n\\njerry: don\\'t ask me! \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m asking you! \\n\\njerry: i\\'m telling you. \\n\\nkramer: you\\'re joking. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m serious! \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s not going to happen again! \\n\\njerry: yes it will, now give me those keys! \\n\\nkramer (getting up): o.k., fine, go ahead, you take the keys! but you\\'re going to regret this. (he angrily storms out. kramer then re-enters seconds later when he realizes he\\'s left his girlfriend in jerry\\'s apartment.) \\n\\njerry: so put \\'em in a safe place. \\n\\nelaine: i will. \\n\\njerry: where? \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t know. i\\'ll hide \\'em. so, is kramer upset? \\n\\njerry: i think so. i mean, he\\'s acting really weird lately...he\\'s different. \\n\\nelaine: well, maybe you should just give him the keys back. \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t. \\n\\nelaine (mouths the words): is that kramer? (jerry nods.) \\n\\njerry: who\\'s there? \\n\\nkramer (in hallway): uh, kramer. (jerry opens the door, kramer enters. elaine waves at kramer with the keys in her hand.) oh, hi...uh...you got the... \\n\\nelaine: oh, i\\'m not, uh... \\n\\nkramer: no, no, no, it\\'s o.k. i don\\'t care about the keys. it\\'s my fault. i gave the keys away with my stupidity. i broke \"the covenant of the keys.\" \\n\\nelaine: jerry, give him the keys back. \\n\\njerry: elaine... \\n\\nkramer: i don\\'t want the keys back! no, i\\'m glad the way things turned out. i was clingin\\' to those keys, man! like a branch on the banks of a raging river. and now i have let go. and i\\'m free...to go with the current. to float. (to jerry) and i thank you. \\n\\njerry: take the keys. \\n\\nkramer: i don\\'t want the keys! (jerry tries to force the keys on kramer, but kramer refuses.) \\n\\njerry: o.k.! \\n\\nkramer: now, one more thing - i would like my keys back. \\n\\njerry: your spare set? \\n\\nkramer: that\\'s right. \\n\\njerry: you want \\'em back? \\n\\nkramer: yeah. yeah, i think it would be for the best. \\n\\ngeorge: gee, kramer, i uh...i don\\'t know what to say. \\n\\nkramer: say yes! yes, george. yes! \\n\\ngeorge: should i give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? because elaine has my keys. \\n\\nkramer: well, you can get \\'em back. \\n\\ngeorge: i suppose i could. \\n\\nkramer: because you see, george, having the keys to jerry\\'s apartment? that kept me in a fantasy world. every time i went over to his house, it was like i was on vacation. better food, better view, better tv. and cleaner? oh - much cleaner. that became my reality. i ignored the squalor in my own life because i\\'m looking at life, you see, through jerry\\'s eyes. i was living in twilight, george. living in the shadows. living in the darkness...like you. \\n\\ngeorge: me? \\n\\nkramer: oh, yeah. i can barely see you, george. \\n\\ngeorge: alright, stop it kramer, you\\'re freakin\\' me out. (the waitress comes over.) \\n\\nwaitress: hi, are you ready to order? (george tries to order, but kramer interrupts.) \\n\\nkramer (moves over and sits next to george): do you ever yearn? \\n\\ngeorge: yearn? do i yearn? \\n\\nkramer: i yearn. \\n\\ngeorge: you yearn. \\n\\nkramer: oh, yes. yes, i yearn. often, i...i sit...and yearn. have you yearned? \\n\\ngeorge: well, not recently. i craved. i crave all the time, constant craving...but i haven\\'t yearned. \\n\\nkramer (in disgust): look at you. \\n\\ngeorge: aw, kramer, don\\'t start... \\n\\nkramer (moving back to the othe side of the booth): you\\'re wasting your life. \\n\\ngeorge: i am not! what you call wasting, i call living! i\\'m living my life! \\n\\nkramer: o.k., like what? no, tell me! do you have a job? \\n\\ngeorge: no. \\n\\nkramer: you got money? \\n\\ngeorge: no. \\n\\nkramer: do you have a woman? \\n\\ngeorge: no. \\n\\nkramer: do you have any prospects? \\n\\ngeorge: no. \\n\\nkramer: you got anything on the horizon? \\n\\ngeorge: uh...no. \\n\\nkramer: do you have any action at all? \\n\\ngeorge: no. \\n\\nkramer: do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning? \\n\\ngeorge: i like to get the daily news! \\n\\nkramer: george, it\\'s time for us to grow up - and be men. not little boys. \\n\\ngeorge: why? \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m goin\\' to california. you know, i got the bug. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, i think i got a touch of something, too. \\n\\nkramer: no, the acting bug. ever since i was in that woody allen movie. \\n\\ngeorge: \"these pretzels are making me thirsty\"? that was one line! you got fired! \\n\\nkramer: i know, i know, but man! i never felt so alive! now, are you coming with me? \\n\\ngeorge: uh, no, i\\'m not. \\n\\nkramer: alright, suit yourself. but let\\'s keep this between us - we\\'re key brothers now. (gets up to leave.) \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'re not really gonna go to california, are you? \\n\\nkramer (points to his head): up here, i\\'m already gone. (kramer exits.) \\n\\ngeorge: anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my keys, so i need mine back from you. \\n\\nelaine: just \\'cause you have his keys? why does he need yours? \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t know. he said he wants to be my \"key brother.\" \\n\\nelaine: that\\'s ridiculous. \\n\\ngeorge (shakes huge keyring): that\\'s kramer. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'ll give you back your spare keys - but now i want mine back. \\n\\ngeorge: what for? \\n\\nelaine: \\'cause. i\\'ll give \\'em to jerry. \\n\\ngeorge: jerry? why? \\n\\nelaine: \\'cause he gave me his. \\n\\ngeorge: so what? \\n\\nelaine: so, if he has my keys, i should have his. \\n\\ngeorge: well, i don\\'t see why if you have his, he should have yours. \\n\\nelaine: i just said the same thing to you. \\n\\ngeorge: what? \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\ngeorge: alright, listen, i\\'ll give you your spare keys, but i don\\'t have them with me. can i please have mine to give to back to kramer? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, o.k. i\\'ll go get \\'em. (george begins to leaf through papers on elaine\\'s counter.) what are you doing? would you just put that down? (takes the papers away from george.) i gotta get some new friends. \\n\\njerry: did you bring the keys? \\n\\ngeorge: yes, but i still don\\'t feel right about letting you into kramer\\'s apartment without his permission. \\n\\njerry: this could be an emergency! \\n\\ngeorge: you never should have taken away his keys! \\n\\njerry: i tried to give \\'em back, he wouldn\\'t take \\'em. (jerry and george go out into the hallway to kramer\\'s apartment.) \\n\\ngeorge: how\\'d the mets do? \\n\\njerry: they lost. \\n\\njerry: kramer? \\n\\nnewman (startling them): hello, boys. \\n\\njerry: hello, newman. \\n\\nnewman: you lookin\\' for someone? \\n\\njerry: don\\'t play coy with me, newman, i\\'m not in the mood! \\n\\nnewman: coy? i\\'m not being coy. \\n\\njerry (to george): is he being coy? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, coy. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re being coy. now where\\'s kramer, newman? \\n\\nnewman (coyly): who? \\n\\njerry: listen, tiny. i wanna know where kramer is and wanna know now! \\n\\nnewman: alright, go ahead and hit me, seinfeld. i got witnesses. \\n\\njerry: turn around, george. \\n\\ngeorge: sure. (turns around.) \\n\\nnewman: george? \\n\\njerry: now, you better tell me where kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way? (hits wall with his fist.) \\n\\nnewman: help! help! \\n\\njerry: where\\'s kramer? \\n\\nnewman: help! (elaine enters.) \\n\\nelaine: what\\'s going on? \\n\\nnewman: they\\'re gonna beat me up! \\n\\ngeorge: no we\\'re not. \\n\\njerry: we\\'re trying to find out what happened to kramer. \\n\\nnewman: you wanna know what happened to kramer? i\\'ll tell you what happened to kramer. he was ticked off. about the keys. yeah, that\\'s right - about the keys. thought he got a bad rap. \\n\\njerry: bad rap? \\n\\nnewman: yeah. from you. \\n\\njerry: me? \\n\\nnewman: you heard me. so he packed it up and split for the coast. la-la land. l.a. \\n\\njerry: l.a.? \\n\\njerry: i never should have taken his keys away. but he drove me to it! i had no choice! he wouldn\\'t take \\'em back. elaine, you saw it, remember? i said, \\'take the keys back.\\' he wouldn\\'t do anything. you saw it, didn\\'t you see it? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, yeah, i saw it. (mutters under her breath) i mean, it\\'s complete bullshit. \\n\\njerry: huh? \\n\\nelaine: what...? \\n\\njerry: no, what\\'d you say? \\n\\nelaine: nothing. i didn\\'t say anything. \\n\\njerry: oh, you didn\\'t see it. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, i saw it. i saw it! i did, i saw it. yep. \\n\\njerry: i heard you say something, there. \\n\\nelaine: i didn\\'t say anything. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m calling kramer\\'s mother. (picks up the phone, dials.) (to elaine) i don\\'t know what you said. but it was something. i heard something. hello? hello, mrs. kramer? mrs. kramer? could you turn the music down? could you turn the music down! \\n\\ngeorge: ask her about kramer. \\n\\njerry: she\\'s drunk out of her mind. \\n\\njerry (leaving a message on elaine\\'s machine): elaine? are you there? it\\'s me, i\\'m locked out of my apartment, i need my spare keys. where are you? i\\'m at the coffee shop. \\n\\nkramer (shouting over the cycle\\'s engine): hey! you ever been in an accident? \\n\\nbiker: about five years ago. i was going down this very road. same time of day, going about the same speed i\\'m going now...there was a rock in the road. couldn\\'t have been more than a pebble. never really saw it! lost control of the bike, went flyin\\' about a hundred feet - came down right on my head. cracked it wide open! blood and stuff was just splattered all over the road, there...i broke every bone in my face. hey, you know, when they found me, my eyes were hanging out of their sockets? yeah, they pronounced me dead at the scene. i was in a coma for...well, they told me about a year...said i\\'d be a vegetable for life. yeah, but i showed \\'em. ever since then i always wear a helmet! (the biker goes into a turn.) lean! (kramer yells.) \\n\\njerry (applauding): georgie boy! way to come through with the keys! sit down, i\\'m buying you dinner. \\n\\ngeorge: look, i gotta tell ya...i been thinkin\\' about it, i just don\\'t feel right about letting you into elaine\\'s apartment. \\n\\njerry: don\\'t feel right? what are you talking about? \\n\\ngeorge: well, you know, i shouldn\\'t have let you into kramer\\'s, now you want to go into elaine\\'s...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can i just let you in? \\n\\njerry: what is the big deal? \\n\\ngeorge: just because you have someone\\'s spare keys, it doesn\\'t entitle you to break into their apartment. that\\'s the reason you took away kramer\\'s keys. \\n\\njerry: first of all, you\\'re not even supposed to have elaine\\'s keys. you\\'re supposed to give \\'em back to her, so she can give \\'em back to me, because she has mine. so technically, those are my keys. \\n\\ngeorge: yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given \\'em to me, in which case i wouldn\\'t have had to take mine back from her. \\n\\njerry: well, i want those keys. (tries to grab the keys from george.) \\n\\ngeorge: nope, no can do. \\n\\njerry: george, give them to me, i want these keys. (they struggle over the keys.) i don\\'t want to get physical! \\n\\ngeorge: do you wanna fight? \\n\\njerry: do you wanna fight? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'ll fight ya! not the face! not the face! (the struggle continues.) \\n\\nkramer: and then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince. \\n\\nhippie #1: oh no. he didn\\'t take back the keys, no way. \\n\\nkramer: yes! and then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel, cruel world. \\n\\nhippie #1: oh man, what a bummer. that ogre dude\\'s pretty cold, huh? \\n\\nkramer: oh, he\\'s cold. \\n\\nhippie #1: lemme tell you something, kramer. if that ogre dude pulled that crap on me (pulls out a knife) - i\\'d stab him! i\\'d cut him in half! i\\'d gut him like a fish, man! that\\'s what i\\'d do! \\n\\nkramer: yeah, yeah...that\\'d be funny. (to driver) hey, you can drop me here! \\n\\nhippie #1: hey, what\\'s the rush, man? \\n\\nkramer: well, you know, i gotta be goin\\' now. \\n\\nhippie #1: hey, kramer - have you ever killed a man? \\n\\nkramer: what do you think, junior? you think these hands have been soakin\\' in ivory liquid? (mimics choking somebody) \\n\\nhippie #2: don\\'t leave, kramer, stay with us. you know so much about the world, we need you, please kramer! (they all start chanting) please, kramer! please, kramer! (scene ends with kramer trying to escape their clutches.) \\n\\njerry: don\\'t you see? you\\'re just avoiding the middle man. you were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give \\'em to me. so, all that\\'s happening is that instead of giving them to her, you\\'re giving them to me. it\\'s just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn\\'t give her hers. \\'cause then she would have given \\'em to me, because she has mine. so then i would have never had to ask you for hers, so that i could get mine. \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'re right, how did i miss that? (begins unlocking the door, mutters under his breath) maybe because it\\'s a crock of shit. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s that? \\n\\ngeorge: nothing. \\n\\njerry: i heard something. \\n\\ngeorge: didn\\'t say anything. (they go into elaine\\'s apartment.) \\n\\nkramer: so, how long you been drivin\\' this thing? \\n\\nwoman: goin\\' on four years. \\n\\nkramer: well, nothin\\'s sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi. \\n\\nwoman: nothin\\'? (they exchange a glance, then laugh.) listen to you, you\\'re quite the sweet-talker. \\n\\nkramer: you know, i always wanted to drive the big rigs. i used to watch those commercials during the reruns of gomer pyle. \\n\\nwoman: you want to give it a try? \\n\\nkramer: really? \\n\\nwoman: do you know how to double-clutch? \\n\\nkramer: yeah. \\n\\nwoman: well, come on! (they trade places and kramer gets behind the wheel. kramer turns out to be really rusty on the ol\\' double-clutch.) \\n\\ngeorge: they were in here, i saw her put \\'em in here! \\n\\njerry: well, this is great. \\n\\ngeorge: well, what do they look like? \\n\\njerry: they look like keys, george. they look exactly like keys. (in disgust) \"what do they look like.\" \\n\\ngeorge: well, they\\'re obviously not here. \\n\\njerry: well, they\\'ve gotta be here somewhere. \\n\\ngeorge: jerry, unless i pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment! \\n\\njerry (looking through some papers on the desk): what is this? \"murphy brown\"? \\n\\ngeorge: what? \\n\\njerry: by elaine benes? \\n\\ngeorge: what? \\n\\njerry: elaine\\'s writing a \"murphy brown\"? \\n\\ngeorge: lemme see this. (tries to grab the papers.) \\n\\njerry: wait a second! (they fight over the paper.) \\n\\ngeorge: gimme half! \\n\\njerry: all right, here! \\n\\ngeorge: why didn\\'t she tell us? \\n\\njerry (making fun): elaine is writing a sitcom...! (elaine enters the room behind jerry and george. jerry spots her and tosses his half of the script at george. george throws it back and paper goes flying everywhere.) \\n\\nelaine: you weasels! \\n\\njerry: what? what? \\n\\nelaine: how dare you! \\n\\ngeorge: we hardly read anything! \\n\\njerry: it was funny! \\n\\nelaine: who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through all my things? you thought it was funny? \\n\\njerry: well... (picks up some of the pages) from what i saw... \\n\\nelaine (grabs the papers from jerry): well, it\\'s just a first draft! \\n\\njerry: i was locked out of my apartment, i\\'m just trying to get my keys. \\n\\nelaine (turning on george): why did you let him in?! (shoves george.) \\n\\ngeorge: he forced me to! \\n\\njerry: i did not! \\n\\ngeorge: yes you did! \\n\\nelaine: you! get out! get out! get out! \\n\\njerry: elaine, wait! i need my spare keys! \\n\\nelaine: here! here\\'s your damn keys, you keep \\'em! i don\\'t want \\'em anymore! \\n\\njerry: good! \\n\\nelaine (to george): and i want my keys back from you! \\n\\ngeorge: what, you don\\'t want me to hold your keys? \\n\\nelaine: no, you can\\'t be trusted! \\n\\ngeorge: alright, alright, fine. (gives the keys to elaine.) \\n\\njerry (to elaine): and i don\\'t want you to hold mine! \\n\\nelaine: good! i won\\'t! \\n\\njerry: good! don\\'t! are these my keys? \\n\\nelaine: these aren\\'t my keys! \\n\\ngeorge: whose are these? \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t know! \\n\\nelaine: i just thought i could write it. \\n\\njerry: is that something you want to do? \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t know. those writers make a lot of money. \\n\\njerry: elaine, let me tell you something about show business. it\\'s hard work! you don\\'t just write a \"murphy brown.\" you gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other. \\n\\nelaine: o.k., can i just watch the show?

\\n\\njerry: no thanks. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'ve got to tell you, i\\'m really disappointed in lupe. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s been three days already, forget about lupe. \\n\\ngeorge: do you think she gets to take any of those little bars of soap home? \\n\\njerry: no, i don\\'t. \\n\\ngeorge: you would think that at the end of the week when they hand out the checks, throw in a few soaps. \\n\\njerry: yeah, maybe they should throw in a couple of lamps too. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'ll tell you something, if i\\'d own a company, my employees would love me. they\\'d have huge pictures of me up on the walls and in their home, like lenin. \\n\\njerry: how much did you wound up tipping her?

\\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\ngeorge: i wonder what toilet paper was loike in the 1860\\'s. did they carry it in rolls in their duffle bags? \\n\\njerry: everything with you comes down to toilet paper. \\n\\ngeorge: what? \\n\\njerry: that\\'s always the first question with you. why is that always your focus? \\n\\ngeorge: all right, so what did they do? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know. maybe they gave out fig leaf clumps to all the soldiers. \\n\\ngeorge: well i think it would be nice if there was some kind of historical record of it. \\n\\njerry: maybe they should have a toilet paper museum. would you like that? so we could see all the toilet paper advancements down through the ages. toilet paper of the crusades, the development of the perforation, the first six-pack . . . \\n\\nstu: excuse me, jerry? i\\'m stu chermak. i\\'m with nbc. \\n\\njerry: hi. \\n\\nstu: could we speak for a few moments? \\n\\njerry: sure. \\n\\njay: hi, jay crespi. \\n\\njerry: hello. \\n\\ngeorge: uh, c-r-e-s-p-i? \\n\\njay: that\\'s right. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m unbelievable at spelling last names. give me a last name. \\n\\njay: mm, i\\'m not- \\n\\njerry: george- \\n\\ngeorge: (backing off) huh? all right, fine. \\n\\nstu: first of all, that was a terrific show. \\n\\njerry: oh thank you very much. \\n\\nstu: and basically, i just wanted to let you know that we\\'ve been discussing you at some of our meetings and we\\'d be very interested in doing something. \\n\\njerry: really? wow. \\n\\nstu: so, if you have any idea for like a tv show for yourself, well, we\\'d just love to talk about it. \\n\\njerry: i\\'d be very interested in something like that. \\n\\nstu: well, here, uh, why don\\'t you give us a call and maybe we can develop a series. \\n\\njerry: okay. great. thanks. \\n\\nstu: it was very nice meeting you. \\n\\njerry: thank you. \\n\\njay: nice meeting you. \\n\\njerry: nice meeting you. \\n\\ngeorge: what was that all about? \\n\\njerry: they said they were interested in me. \\n\\ngeorge: for what? \\n\\njerry: you know, a tv show. \\n\\ngeorge: your own show? \\n\\njerry: yeah, i guess so. \\n\\ngeorge: they want you to do a tv show? \\n\\njerry: well, they want me to come up with an idea. i mean, i don\\'t have any ideas. \\n\\ngeorge: come on, how hard is that? look at all the junk that\\'s on tv. you want an idea? here\\'s an idea. you coach gymnastics team in high school. and you\\'re married. and your son\\'s not interested in gymnastics and you\\'re pushing him into gymnastics. \\n\\njerry: why should i care if my son\\'s into gymnastics? \\n\\ngeorge: because you\\'re a gymnastics teacher. it\\'s only natural. \\n\\njerry: but gymnastics is not for everybody. \\n\\ngeorge: i know, but he\\'s your son. \\n\\njerry: so what? \\n\\ngeorge: all right, forget that idea, it\\'s not for you....okay, okay, i got it. you run an antique store. \\n\\njerry: yeah and...? \\n\\ngeorge: and people come in the store and you get involved in their lives. \\n\\njerry: what person who runs an antique store gets involved in people\\'s lives? \\n\\ngeorge: why not? \\n\\njerry: so someone comes in to buy an old lamp and all of a sudden i\\'m getting them out of a jam? i could see if i was a pharmacist because a pharmacist knows what\\'s wrong with everybody that comes in. \\n\\ngeorge: i know, but antiques are very popular right now. \\n\\njerry: no they\\'re not, they used to be. \\n\\ngeorge: oh yeah, like you know. \\n\\njerry: oh like you do. \\n\\nkramer: ...and you\\'re the manager of the circus. \\n\\njerry: a circus? \\n\\nkramer: come on, this is a great idea. look at the characters. you\\'ve got all these freaks on the show. a woman with a moustache? i mean, who wouldn\\'t tune in to see a women with a moustache? you\\'ve for the tallest man in the world; a guy who\\'s just a head. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t think so. \\n\\nkramer: look jerry, the show isn\\'t about the circus, it\\'s about watching freaks. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t think the network will go for it. \\n\\nkramer: why not? \\n\\njerry: look, i\\'m not pitching a show about freaks. \\n\\nkramer: oh come on jerry, you\\'re wrong. people they want to watch freaks. this is a \"can\\'t miss.\" \\n\\nnewman: kramer. \\n\\njerry: hello newman. \\n\\nnewman: come on lets go. i got the helmet. lets get the radar detector. \\n\\nkramer: all right i\\'ll be back in a second. you guys coming to my party? (exits) \\n\\njerry and newman: yeah, sure. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s this all about? \\n\\nnewman: we\\'re making a trade. i\\'m giving him my motorcycle helmet - he\\'s giving me his radar detector. \\n\\njerry: i didn\\'t know you had a motorctcle. \\n\\nnewman: well my girlfriend had one. \\n\\njerry: you have a girlfriend? \\n\\nnewman: i had a girlfriend and she was pretty wild. \\n\\njerry: i never remember you with a girl. \\n\\nnewman: nevertheless, ... \\n\\njerry: this is a pretty bad deal for kramer. you know a radar detector is worth much more than that helmet. i think you\\'re cheating him. \\n\\nnewman: don\\'t say anything. \\n\\njerry: all right. \\n\\njerry: you know you\\'re getting gypped over here. \\n\\nkramer: really, ah, \\n\\nnewman: we had a deal. are you reneging out of the deal? are you reneging? that\\'s a renege. \\n\\nkramer: oh, stop saying \\'reneging\". \\n\\nnewman: well you\\'re reneging. \\n\\nkramer: i, okay, okay. i\\'m not reneging. \\n\\nnewman: all right give it to me. let go ... \\n\\nkramer: you let go - come on ...(they fight over the items) \\n\\njerry: gimme that - just gimme that. here. idiots! \\n\\nnewman: thanks buddy. so long he he ...(exits) \\n\\njerry: does that thing work? \\n\\nkramer: nah. \\n\\njerry: ... i just got a postcard from elaine? \\n\\ngeorge: really? \\n\\njerry: yeah, they\\'re in london now. they\\'ll be back in a few weeks. \\n\\ngeorge: i can\\'t believe she got involved with a shrink. \\n\\ngeorge: so, what\\'s happening with the tv show? you come up with anything? \\n\\njerry: no, nothing. \\n\\ngeorge: why don\\'t they have salsa on the table? \\n\\njerry: what do you need salsa for? \\n\\ngeorge: salsa is now the number one condiment in america. \\n\\njerry: you know why? because people like to say \"salsa.\" \"excuse me, do you have salsa?\" \"we need more salsa.\" \"where is the salsa? no salsa?\" \\n\\ngeorge: you know it must be impossible for a spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa. (angry) \"i wanted seltzer, not salsa.\" \\n\\njerry: \"don\\'t you know the difference between seltzer and salsa?? you have the seltezer after the salsa!\" \\n\\ngeorge: see, this should be a show. this is the show. \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\ngeorge: this. just talking. \\n\\njerry: (dismissing) yeah, right. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m really serious. i think that\\'s a good idea. \\n\\njerry: just talking? well what\\'s the show about? \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s about nothing. \\n\\njerry: no story? \\n\\ngeorge: no forget the story. \\n\\njerry: you\\'ve got to have a story. \\n\\ngeorge: who says you gotta have a story? remember when we were waiting for, for that table in that chinese restaurant that time? that could be a tv show. \\n\\njerry: and who is on the show? who are the characters? \\n\\ngeorge: i could be a character. \\n\\njerry: you? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. you could base a character on me. \\n\\njerry: so, on the show, there\\'s a character named george costanza? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. there\\'s something wrong with that? i\\'m a character. people are always saying to me, \"you know you\\'re a quite a character.\" \\n\\njerry: and who else is on the show? \\n\\ngeorge: elaine could be a character. kramer.. \\n\\njerry: now he\\'s a character. (pause) so everybody i know is a character on the show. \\n\\ngeorge: right. \\n\\njerry: and it\\'s about nothing? \\n\\ngeorge: absolutely nothing. \\n\\njerry: so you\\'re saying, i go in to nbc, and tell them i got this idea for a show about nothing. \\n\\ngeorge: we go into nbc. \\n\\njerry: \"we\"? since when are you a writer? \\n\\ngeorge: (scoffs) writer. we\\'re talking about a sit-com. \\n\\njerry: you want to go with me to nbc? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. i think we really go something here. \\n\\njerry: what do we got? \\n\\ngeorge: an idea. \\n\\njerry: what idea? \\n\\ngeorge: an idea for the show. \\n\\njerry: i still don\\'t know what the idea is. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s about nothing. \\n\\njerry: right. \\n\\ngeorge: everybody\\'s doing something, we\\'ll do nothing. \\n\\njerry: so, we go into nbc, we tell them we\\'ve got an idea for a show about nothing. \\n\\ngeorge: exactly. \\n\\njerry: they say, \"what\\'s your show about?\" i say, \"nothing.\" \\n\\ngeorge: there you go. \\n\\njerry: (nodding) i think you may have something there. \\n\\njerry: so, the show would be about my real life. and one of the characters would be based on you. \\n\\nkramer: (thinks) no, i don\\'t think so. \\n\\njerry: what do you mean you don\\'t think so? \\n\\nkramer: i don\\'t like it. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t understand. what don\\'t you like about it? \\n\\nkramer: i don\\'t like the idea of a character based on me. \\n\\njerry: why not? \\n\\nkramer: well it just doesn\\'t sit well. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re my neighbor. there\\'s got to be a character based on you. \\n\\nkramer: that\\'s your problem, buddy. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t understand what the big deal is. \\n\\nkramer: hey, i\\'ll tell you what - you can do it on one condition. \\n\\njerry: whatever you want. \\n\\nkramer: i get to play kramer. \\n\\njerry: you can\\'t play kramer. \\n\\nkramer: i am kramer. \\n\\njerry: but you can\\'t act. \\n\\nkramer: phew! \\n\\njerry: okay, fine. we\\'ll use newman. \\n\\nkramer: newman? \\n\\nnewman: use me for what? \\n\\njerry: nothin\\' what do you want? \\n\\nnewman: well, you\\'ll never guess what happened to me today. i was uh, driving ( jerry and kramer turn away) home on the palisades parkway when i looked in the rear view mirror and what did i see? the fuzz. and it\\'s funny because my new radar detector was on. i didn\\'t hear a thing. isn\\'t that strange? \\n\\nkramer: yeah. that\\'s strange. \\n\\nnewman: a radar detector, as i understand it, detects radar! with a series of beeps and flashing lights. but oddly, for some reason i didn\\'t hear a thing except for the sound of a police siren. \\n\\nkramer: that\\'s queer uh? \\n\\nnewman: i want my helmet back! give me back my helmet and you\\'re going to pay for that ticket. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, you better think again mojumbo. \\n\\nnewman: you gave me a defective detector. ... jerry? \\n\\njerry: buyer beware. \\n\\nnewman: are you going to give me back that helmet or not? \\n\\nkramer: no. we had a deal. there are no guarantees in life. \\n\\nnewman: no, but there\\'s karma, kramer. \\n\\njerry: karma kramer? \\n\\nnewman: and one more thing. i\\'m not coming to your party. (exits) \\n\\njerry: (to himself) salsa, seltzer. hey, excuse me, you got any salsa? no, not selzer, salsa.

i just said something. i didn\\'t know you were going to listen to me. \\n\\njerry: dont\\' worry about it. they\\'re just tv executives. \\n\\ngeorge: they\\'re men with jobs, jerry! they wear suits and ties. they\\'re married, they have secretaries. \\n\\njerry: i told you not to come. \\n\\ngeorge: i need some water. i gotta get some water. \\n\\njerry: they\\'ll give us water in there. \\n\\ngeorge: really?

\\n\\njerry: kramer\\'s party. \\n\\ndevola: kramer\\'s ... having ... a ... party? \\n\\njerry: no, no, he\\'s not having a party. he\\'s doing something. i don\\'t know what it is. it\\'s nothing. he\\'s not doing anything. \\n\\ndevola: gee, i thought kramer and i were very close friends. \\n\\njerry: no, i\\'m sure you are. i\\'m sure you are very close friends. very close. \\n\\njerry: give my best to hinckley. \\n\\ngeorge: what was that? \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t believe what i just did. i didn\\'t know kramer didn\\'t invite him. i better call kramer, ... \\n\\nreceptionist: they\\'re ready for you. \\n\\ngeorge: okay, okay. look, you do all the talking, okay? \\n\\njerry: relax. who are they? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, they\\'re not better than me. \\n\\njerry: course not. \\n\\ngeorge: who are they? \\n\\njerry: they\\'re nobody. \\n\\ngeorge: what about me? \\n\\njerry: what about you? \\n\\ngeorge: why them? why not me? \\n\\njerry: why not you? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m as good as them. \\n\\njerry: better. \\n\\ngeorge: you really think so? \\n\\njerry: no. \\n\\nstu: (to jerry, laughing about one of his bits) the bit, the bit i really liked what were the parakeet flew into the mirror. now that\\'s funny. \\n\\ngeorge: the parakeet in the mirror. that\\'s a good one, stu. \\n\\njerry: yeah, it\\'s one of my favorites. \\n\\nrussell: what about you, george? have you written anything we might know? \\n\\ngeorge: (quickly making it up) well, possibly. i wrote an off-broadway show, \"la cocina.\" ..actually, it was off-off-broadway. it was a comedy about a mexican chef. \\n\\njerry: oh, it was very funny. there was one great scene with the chef - what was his name? \\n\\ngeorge: pepe. \\n\\njerry: oh, pepe. yeah, pepe. and, uh, he was making tamales. \\n\\nsusan: oh, he actually cooked on the stage? \\n\\ngeorge: no, no, he mimed it. that\\'s what was so funny about it. \\n\\nrussell: so, what have you two come up with? \\n\\njerry: well, we\\'ve thought about this in a variety of ways. but the basic idea is i will play myself- \\n\\ngeorge: (interrupting) may i? \\n\\njerry: go ahead. \\n\\ngeorge: i think i can sum up the show for you with one word nothing. \\n\\nrussell: nothing? \\n\\ngeorge: (smiling) nothing. \\n\\nrussell: (unimpressed) what does that mean? \\n\\ngeorge: the show is about nothing. \\n\\njerry: (to george) well, it\\'s not about nothing. \\n\\ngeorge: (to jerry) no, it\\'s about nothing. \\n\\njerry: well, maybe in philosophy. but, even nothing is something. \\n\\nreceptionist: mr. dalrymple, your niece is on the phone. \\n\\nrussell: i\\'ll call back. \\n\\ngeorge: (attempting to spell his last name) d-a-l-r-i-m-p-e-l? \\n\\nrussell: (obviously dislikes george) not even close. \\n\\ngeorge: is it with a \"y\"? \\n\\nrussell: no. \\n\\nsusan: what\\'s the premise? \\n\\njerry: ..well, as i was saying, i would play myself, and, as a comedian, living in new york, i have a friend, a neighbor, and an ex-girlfriend, which is all true. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, but nothing happens on the show. you see, it\\'s just like life. you know, you eat, you go shopping, you read.. you eat, you read, you go shopping. \\n\\nrussell: you read? you read on the show? \\n\\njerry: well, i don\\'t know about the reading.. we didn\\'t discuss the reading. \\n\\nrussell: all right, tell me, tell me about the stories. what kind of stories? \\n\\ngeorge: oh, no. no stories. \\n\\nrussell: no stories? so, what is it? \\n\\ngeorge: (showing an example) what\\'d you do today? \\n\\nrussell: i got up and came to work. \\n\\ngeorge: there\\'s a show. that\\'s a show. \\n\\nrussell: (confused) how is that a show? \\n\\njerry: well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work. \\n\\ngeorge: no, no, no. nothing happens. \\n\\njerry: well, something happens. \\n\\nrussell: well, why am i watching it? \\n\\ngeorge: because it\\'s on tv. \\n\\nrussell: (threatening) not yet. \\n\\ngeorge: okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing, then maybe this idea is not for you. i, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. and i\\'ll tell you something else, this is the show and we\\'re not going to change it. (to jerry) right? \\n\\njerry: (to russell) how about this i manage a circus.. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t even want to talk about it anymore. what were you thinking? what was going on in your mind? artistic integrity? where, where did you come up with that? you\\'re not artistic and you have no integrity. you know you really need some help. a regular psychiatrist couldn\\'t even help you. you need to go to like vienna or something. you know what i mean? you need to get involved at the university level. like where freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. that\\'s the kind of help you need. not the once a week for eighty bucks. no. you need a team. a team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the elephant man. that\\'s what i\\'m talking about because that\\'s the only way you\\'re going to get better. \\n\\ngeorge: . . . i thought the woman was kind of cute. \\n\\njerry: hold it. i really want to be clear about this. are you talking about the woman in the meeting? is that the woman you\\'re talking about? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, i thought i might give her a call. i, i don\\'t meet that many women. i meet like three women a year. i mean, we\\'ve been introduced. she knows my name. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s completely inappropriate! \\n\\ngeorge: why? maybe she liked me. i, i mean she was looking right at me. you know, i think she was impressed. you know, we had good eye contact the whole meeting. \\n\\njerry: oh, i forgot to call kramer. \\n\\ngeorge: wait a minute let me call susan. \\n\\njerry: no, no this is more important. \\n\\ngeorge: she might be leaving to work any minute. \\n\\njerry: no, i got to warn him that i told joe devola about his party. \\n\\ngeorge: no. \\n\\nelaine: what is it? \\n\\ndr. reston: i was just thinking about this patient of mine. \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\ndr. reston: just wondering if he\\'s taking his medication. \\n\\nelaine: well, come on we\\'re on vacation. \\n\\njerry: well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and you know how devola is. he\\'s all, ... (buzzer) \\n\\nkramer: yeah (to buzzer) \\n\\ngeorge: (oc) it\\'s george. \\n\\njerry: and so, uh i felt very uncomfortable with him and you know i just blurted out something about your party. \\n\\nkramer: whoa, back up a second. \\n\\njerry: well, i didn\\'t know that you didn\\'t invite him. \\n\\nkramer: why would you think i would invite him? \\n\\njerry: i just a ssumed, ... \\n\\nkramer: assumed? never assume anything. i don\\'t want that nut in my house. you know he\\'s on medication. \\n\\ngeorge: hello, oh, hello. you remember, ... susan, from n b c. \\n\\njerry: of course. how are you? \\n\\nsusan: fine, it\\'s good to see you. \\n\\ngeorge: and this is kramer. \\n\\nsusan: hello. \\n\\ngeorge: all right go ahead susan, tell him. \\n\\njerry: tell me what? \\n\\nsusan: well, i, (phone rings) \\n\\njerry: uh, sorry, excuse me one second. hello. \\n\\ntel: hi, would you be interested in switching over to tmi long distance service. \\n\\njerry: oh, gee, i can\\'t talk right now. why don\\'t you give me your home number and i\\'ll call you later. \\n\\ntel: uh, i\\'m sorry we\\'re not allowed to do that. \\n\\njerry: oh, i guess you don\\'t want people calling you at home. \\n\\ntel: no. \\n\\njerry: well now you know how i feel. (hangs up) \\n\\ngeorge: well, go ahead, tell him. \\n\\njerry: kramer, are you drinking that milk? \\n\\nkramer: yeah. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s the expiration date on that? \\n\\nkramer: september third. \\n\\njerry: the third? \\n\\ngeorge: and susan the third? \\n\\nkramer: um, uh, ugh, ... \\n\\nsusan: noooo... (kramer throws up on susan) \\n\\ngeorge: i never should have brought her up there. should have known better. should have seen it coming. i didn\\'t see it coming. \\n\\njerry: i think she saw it coming. \\n\\ngeorge: you know she was behind the idea. she was going to champion the show. that\\'s what i was bring her up there to tell you. and she liked me. \\n\\njerry: look just because kramer vomited on her doesn\\'t mean the deal is dead. \\n\\ngeorge: what, are you crazy? it\\'s a traumatic thing to be thrown up on. \\n\\njerry: vommiting is not a deal breaker. if hitler had vommited on chamberlin, chamberlind still would have given him chekoslovakia. \\n\\ngeorge: chamberlind, you could hold his head in nthe toilet, he\\'d still give you half of europe. \\n\\njerry: what happened to you? \\n\\nkramer: devola came after me. \\n\\njerry: what? devola? see i told you this guy is crazy. i can\\'t believe this. what happened? \\n\\nkramer: can i have a coffee. ... what, you know i was walking home and i had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know. i gota new strap. and i had it on you know, and i was checking the strap out to make sure it fit. then suddenly i feel this kick hit me on the side of the head. it knocks me down, i look up and it\\'s crazy joe devola. and he say\\'s, \"that\\'s what i thin k of your party.\" \\n\\njerry: boy, that is some kick. \\n\\nkramer: well, yeah, newman\\'s helmet, it saved my life. look at that. \\n\\njerry: wow, newman\\'s helmet. \\n\\ngeorge: holly. \\n\\nkramer: i got bad news for you buddy. devola says you\\'re next. \\n\\njerry: me, why? \\n\\nkramer: he doesn\\'t like you. \\n\\njerry: what does he want from me? i didn\\'t do anything. see this is all elaine\\'s fault. she took off to europe with his psychiatrist. he probably can\\'t get his medication. now i got some nut after me. \\n\\nkramer: pass the cream. \\n\\ngeorge: wait a second. (smells it). all right. \\n\\njerry: (going through couch cushions) where the hell did i put this? \\n\\nkramer: what are you looking for? \\n\\njerry: the remote, the remote, i can\\'t find the remote. did i lost, i lost it. did you take it? did you put it some place? \\n\\nkramer: no, no, no. \\n\\njerry: all right, what is this? \\n\\nkramer: (clueless) what is what? \\n\\njerry: all right, very funny. i get it. \\n\\nkramer: you\\'re in a weird mood. \\n\\njerry: come on. go back to your apartment and fix it. \\n\\nkramer: fix what? \\n\\njerry: your pants! \\n\\nkramer: what is this? what have i got one pant leg on for? \\n\\njerry: don\\'t you know? look-look at your face! you only shaved the right side of your face! what is this? a joke? \\n\\nkramer: no, t\\'s a joke.. a joke... a joke... you think this is funny? \\n\\njerry: go look at your face in the mirror. \\n\\nkramer: wha-huh-wha-huh... \\n\\njerry: (pressing intercom) yeah? \\n\\ngeorge: (on intercom) it\\'s george. \\n\\njerry: come on up. \\n\\nkramer: i don\\'t believe this. \\n\\njerry: you mean, you didn\\'t know you were doing any of these things? \\n\\nkramer: no, i swear. \\n\\njerry: i bet this is from that kick from that crazy joe davola. you better see a doctor and get some x-rays. \\n\\ngeorge: (to kramer) ah! you\\'re just the man i\\'m looking for. \\n\\nkramer: me? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, here you go. \\n\\nkramer: what\\'s this? \\n\\ngeorge: a dry-cleaning bill? \\n\\njerry: from that woman at nbc? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. \\n\\nkramer: a dry-cleaning bill for what? \\n\\ngeorge: for vomiting on her vest! \\n\\nkramer: oh, come on george! i didn\\'t do that on purpose! \\n\\ngeorge: well, i shouldn\\'t have to pay for it! \\n\\nkramer: well, neither should i! jerry\\'s the one who left the milk in the refrigerator. \\n\\ngeorge: (to jerry) yeah, your milk. \\n\\njerry: (pointing kramer) he drank it. \\n\\nkramer: i didn\\'t know. \\n\\njerry: all right, well, we should all chip in i guess. \\n\\nkramer: yeah. \\n\\njerry: how much was it to clean the vest? \\n\\ngeorge: eighteen dollars. \\n\\njerry: can you get vomit out of suede? \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t know. \\n\\nkramer: yo-yo ma! \\n\\njerry: what? yo-yo ma? \\n\\nkramer: what about him? \\n\\njerry: you just said \\'yo-yo ma\\'. \\n\\ngeorge: what\\'s yo-yo ma? \\n\\njerry: he\\'s a cellist. (to kramer) you should see a doctor today. \\n\\ngeorge: all right, come on, come on, let\\'s go. six dollars. \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t believe she sent you that dry-cleaning bill. \\n\\ngeorge: i know! \\n\\njerry: that doesn\\'t really bode well for the show, does it? \\n\\ngeorge: the show! forget about the show! we should take the idea to a different network \\n\\njerry: oh, yeah. right. like anybody\\'s ever gonna do this! how did you get me to go along with that? a show about nothing! \\n\\ngeorge: it was a good idea. susan liked it. now, if he hadn\\'t vomitted all over her, we\\'d be writing it right now. \\n\\nkramer: jeez! \\n\\ngeorge: anyway. \\n\\njerry: (interrupts) what are you doing? what\\'s wrong with you? what\\'re you doing? give me that phone! go to your apartment and lie down, i\\'ll make an appointment for a doctor today. (on the phone) hello? oh hi! i\\'m sorry. no, that\\'s my next door neighbor. he\\'s not quite himself. he got kicked in the head. what? really? you\\'re kidding! today? yeah! sure! we could make it. two o\\'clock? yeah, we would do that. okay. great! thanks a million! okay, bye. \\n\\ngeorge: what? \\n\\njerry: nbc! they wanna have another meeting about the idea. \\n\\ngeorge: they wanna have another meeting? they wanna buy it?! they wanna but it?! oh! i tell you! we\\'re gonna be rich!! what are we gonna get for this? fifty, sixty thousand? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know about sixty. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, it\\'s gotta be fifty! hee hee! you know how much ted danson makes, huh? \\n\\njerry: ted danson! now, how are you comparing us to ted danson?

\\n\\njerry: yeah! but it never works. you know we\\'re supposed to be there by two o\\'clock. we should take a cab. \\n\\ngeorge: all right, we\\'ll be a little late, i,m not taking a cab. \\n\\njerry: i\\'ll pay for it. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s not the money! \\n\\njerry: well, what is it you object to? the comfort? the speed? the convenience? \\n\\nleo: jerry! \\n\\njerry: uncle leo! \\n\\nleo: helloooo! \\n\\njerry: hello there, how\\'re you doing? \\n\\nleo: ha ha! how are you? \\n\\njerry: good, good. \\n\\nleo: how\\'s your mom and dad?

it gets hot at night, you can\\'t sleep. you ever tried to sleep in a really hot room? \\n\\nnewman: every night i sleep in a really hot room, i don\\'t want to kill myself. \\n\\nkramer: well, i slept in really hot rooms and i wanted to kill myself. \\n\\nnewman: no, no, no. that\\'s not gonna work. something else. \\n\\nkramer: i was never able to become a banker. \\n\\nnewman: banker! so you\\'re killing yourself because your dreams of becoming a banker have gone unfulfilled. you-you-you-you can\\'t live without being a banker. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, yeah. if i can\\'t be banker, i don\\'t wanna live. \\n\\nnewman: you must be banker. \\n\\nkramer: must be banker. \\n\\nnewman (satisfied): okay, we\\'ll go with the banker story. \\n\\ngeorge: the story is the foundation of all entertainment. you must have a good story otherwise it\\'s just masturbation. \\n\\nrussel: and people really have to care about the characters. \\n\\ngeorge: care? forget about care. love. they have to love the characters. otherwise, why would they keep tuning in? \\n\\njerry: wouldn\\'t tune in. \\n\\ngeorge: would they tune in? \\n\\njerry: no tune. \\n\\nrussel: we like to look at the show as if it were in ekg. you have your highs and your lows and it goes up and down. \\n\\ngeorge: the show will be like a heart attack! \\n\\njerry: just a huge massive coronary. \\n\\nrussel: so what you said last week about no story, you\\'re a little flexible on that now. \\n\\ngeorge: is-is that what i said \\'no story\\'? because jerry had to tell me later. \\n\\njerry: he couldn\\'t believe it. \\n\\ngeorge: (laughs, snorts) i said, i said \\'get outta here! no story? is that what i said?\\' \\n\\npolice officer: well, i informed him that he was exceeding the speed limit and uh, that\\'s when he told me that he was racing home because his friend was about to commit suicide. \\n\\njudge: and then what happened? \\n\\npolice officer: well, then he became very loud and hysterical. he was flailing his arms about as he told the story and then he threw himself on the ground and he grabbed me around the legs and then he begged me to let him go. and when i refused, that\\'s when he began to scream \\'my friend\\'s going to die, my friend\\'s going to die.\\' \\n\\nrussel: look. i don\\'t know how you two guys feel but we would really like to be in business with you. \\n\\ngeorge: well, we would like to be in business. let\\'s do business. we\\'ll have some business. let\\'s have business. \\n\\njerry: we would love to be in business. we\\'ll do business. we\\'re in business. it\\'s... it\\'s business. this is business. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah! \\n\\nstu: would it be possible to get a-a-a copy of \\'la cocina\\'?

(indicates jerry) he brings in a watch, it takes over a week to fix. he fixed yours in one day. \\n\\njerry: oh, you know these jewellers, they\\'re enigmas. they\\'re mysteries, wrapped in a riddle. \\n\\nhelen: (indicating to jerry) she\\'s very attractive. \\n\\njerry: she\\'s okay. \\n\\nhelen: just okay? \\n\\njerry: she\\'s nice. \\n\\nhelen: she\\'s better than nice. \\n\\njerry: she\\'s all right. \\n\\nhelen: she\\'s beautiful. \\n\\njerry: she\\'s not beautiful. \\n\\nhelen: i think she\\'s beautiful. \\n\\njerry: so you ask her out. \\n\\nhelen: i\\'m not gonna ask her out. \\n\\njerry: why not? \\n\\nhelen: if you don\\'t think she\\'s beautiful, there\\'s something wrong with you. \\n\\njerry: she\\'s pretty. she\\'s not beautiful. \\n\\nhelen: i should drop dead if she\\'s not beautiful. \\n\\njerry: i think that\\'s a little extreme. \\n\\nleo: (grudgingly) she\\'s awright. \\n\\nmorty: (oblivious to the above) two exact same watches. he tells you a week, and him a day. how could that be? something\\'s fishy about this. \\n\\ngeorge: he said what? \\n\\nsusan: \"the hell with them.\" \\n\\ngeorge: \"the hell with them?\" \\n\\nsusan: those were his exact words. \\n\\ngeorge: (worried) oh boy. \\n\\nsusan: he said, \"we\\'ve got five hundred shows to choose from. why should we give two guys, who have no idea, and no experience, more money?\" \\n\\ngeorge: (still worried) he was pretty emphatic? \\n\\nsusan: pounded on his desk. \\n\\ngeorge: pounded? \\n\\nsusan: (tossing her purse on the dash) i told you to take the offer. \\n\\ngeorge: (getting animated) look i, i uh, i had nothing to do with this. it wasn\\'t my decision. it was jerry! jerry told me no. i\\'m the creative guy. he handles the business end. \\n\\nsusan: you said it was insulting. \\n\\ngeorge: i was quoting him. why would i be insulted? i\\'m never insulted. you could call me baldy, dump soup on my head. nothing insults me. \\n\\nsusan: well, there\\'s nothing i can do. \\n\\ngeorge: well, don\\'t they make a counter offer? how can they just cancel the whole deal like that? what kind of a maniac is this guy? i mean he just, he says no, and that\\'s it? \\n\\nsusan: yeah, that\\'s the way russell is. he doesn\\'t like to play games. \\n\\ngeorge: well, he has to play! he can\\'t just not play. we\\'re playing! look, i gotta see him, how do i get in touch with him? \\n\\nsusan: you\\'ll have to wait til monday. \\n\\ngeorge: mon...? no, no, i can\\'t wait til monday, that\\'s impossible, i gotta talk to him now. where does he live? \\n\\nsusan: (laugh) i can\\'t give you his address. \\n\\nsusan: give it back! \\n\\ngeorge: gimme the purse! \\n\\nelaine: okay, so he just wants to talk to you. i couldn\\'t talk him out of it. so you just tell him that you\\'re my boyfriend and that we\\'re in love, okay. can you do that? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, yeah, okay. i\\'m your boyfriend. \\n\\nelaine: okay. \\n\\nkramer: have we been intimate? \\n\\nelaine: yeah. yeah, we\\'ve been intimate. \\n\\nkramer: alright, how often do we do it? \\n\\nelaine: kramer, how is that important? honestly, do you really think he\\'s gonna ask you that? \\n\\nkramer: elaine, he\\'s a psychiatrist. they\\'re interested in stuff like that. \\n\\nelaine: alright, alright. we do it, uh...

(hangs up, peeved) now i gotta have a drink with her. \\n\\n[setting: the ross\\' house] \\n\\ngeorge: the cabin.. (laughs nervously) well.. (pauses as he thinks of a way to break the news, then decides to pass it off) susan? \\n\\nsusan: uhh.. about the cabin.. \\n\\nmr. ross: (cutting her off) i love that place. my father built that cabin in 1947. my mother was recuperating from impetigo at the time, and dad thought it would be a good idea to get her out into the fresh air. she died there the following winter. and he passed away 10 years later to the day. his last words to me were, (mrs. ross, bored out of her mind, has obviously heard this story a million times - she mouths the words as mr. ross says them) \"cherish the cabin.\" not, uh, \"take care of your sister.\" (adding) she\\'s a paraplegic. but, \"cherish the cabin.\" (smiling, reflecting) and i have.. for 45 years. it\\'s often been a.. sanctuary for me. \\n\\ngeorge: (annoyingly butting in) kinda like superman\\'s fortress of solitude. \\n\\nmr. ross: what? \\n\\ngeorge: s, uh, superman - he, uh, built the fortress of solitude up at the north pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it all.. \\n\\nmr. ross: when i go, i\\'m passing it on to her. (pointing at susan) \\n\\nmrs. ross: (drunk, she laughs out loud) i\\'ll take a hotel any day. \\n\\nsusan: daddy.. \\n\\nmr. ross: yes? \\n\\nsusan: daddy, about the cabin.. \\n\\nmrs. ross: (laughing, she points to her shirt) look, henry, i spilled wine on me! (laughs again) \\n\\nmr. ross: (to susan) what about it? \\n\\nsusan: well, the thing is.. \\n\\nmr. ross: what? what is it? \\n\\nsusan: well, the - the cabin, is, kind of, uh.. george? \\n\\ngeorge: (extremely blunt) burned. \\n\\nmr. ross: burned? \\n\\nsusan: there was a fire, and it uh.. \\n\\ngeorge: burned. \\n\\nmr. ross: (still trying to comprehend what has happened) the cabin burned? \\n\\ngeorge: (laughs) yeah, burned. whoo.. \\n\\nmrs. ross: (laughing out loud) burned! (george laughs with her) \\n\\nmr. ross: was anything found? was it all burned to the ground?! did they find anything? \\n\\nsusan: (solemn) no. nothing. \\n\\nmrs. ross: (laughing, she\\'s obviously getting a kick out of her husband\\'s misfortune) nothing! ha, ha, ha. \\n\\ngeorge: eh, but, you know, mr. ross, if - if you look at the whole situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it\\'s really rather ironic - one might even say, in a sense, comical.. (mr. ross has, by now, left the room. mrs. ross is pointing at george, nodding, laughing. as if to say he hit the bullseye. george calls out to mr. ross) really. think about it. \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\nsandra: (offended) i can\\'t believe you said that! \\n\\njerry: what?! \\n\\nsandra: (buttoning her jacket) how could you say something like that to me?! \\n\\njerry: what? what?! you were the one who was talking dirty. i was just trying to keep up! \\n\\nsandra: that was a weird thing to say. \\n\\njerry: why? it didn\\'t mean anything. i was just trying to join in so you wouldn\\'t feel embarrassed. \\n\\nsandra: ohh, i think you\\'re really sick. \\n\\njerry: (getting slightly offended) i\\'m not sick. (pointing at her) you - you said much sicker things than me. \\n\\nsandra: i\\'m leaving. (moves toward the door. jerry blocks her path) \\n\\njerry: i really think you\\'re making too much of this. \\n\\nsandra: (attempting to get past him) excuse me. (they both move to the door) \\n\\njerry: let me walk you to a cab. \\n\\nsandra: (opens the door) that\\'s ok. \\n\\njerry: i mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that\\'ll be the end of it. \\n\\nsandra: oh, really? (quickly walks out) \\n\\njerry: (calling after her) i mean, people - they\\'re not interested in things like this. they don\\'t want to hear about it. they really don\\'t. \\n\\n[setting: the coffee shop] \\n\\njerry: so, we\\'re.. uhh, drinkin\\' and talkin\\', and uhh, so, she starts rubbing my leg. \\n\\ngeorge: wo-hoah! what did you do? \\n\\njerry: (sarcastic) have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, right. \\n\\njerry: i mean, i know it\\'s the wrong thing to do. she works in elaine\\'s office. i know it\\'s wrong - but i can\\'t get that hand off my leg. i mean, i\\'m looking at the hand, and i\\'m thinking, \"that hand should not be on my leg.\" but i can\\'t make my brain to get my mouth to say the words, \"would you mind?!\" \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. how do they do that? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know, they\\'re working on a whole other level.. \\n\\ngeorge: alright, so, go ahead. \\n\\njerry: so we go back to my apartment.. \\n\\ngeorge: (expressing shock) woah. whoa! woah! \\n\\njerry: so, we\\'re, uh, foolin\\' around there.. you know, it\\'s getting a little passionate.. (scoots closer to george, to prevent others from hearing) and, uh, she starts with the dirty talking. \\n\\ngeorge: (putting his hands up) alright, alright, hold on! (jerry has george\\'s full attention) time out! woah, woah! (scooting in, giddy) what did she say? \\n\\njerry: (modest) oh, you know, the usual.. \\n\\ngeorge: no, i don\\'t know. how do i know the usual? \\n\\njerry: typical things. \\n\\ngeorge: (picking up the ketchup) what typical? gimme typical. gimme some typical. \\n\\njerry: she says, uh.. (mumbles something inaudible. george, so shocked by what he\\'s just heard, accidentally squeezes the ketchup bottle - ketchup squirts out and files off-screen. george reacts deeply) \\n\\ngeorge: (breathing deeply) that\\'s very dirty. (jerry nods) that\\'s absolutely filthy. \\n\\njerry: ..and then she starts talking about her panties. \\n\\ngeorge: (yelling out to a waitress) gonna need some water here! \\n\\njerry: so i said something. \\n\\ngeorge: ok, what did you say? \\n\\njerry: (defensively) now, bear in mind, i am just trying to keep up. \\n\\ngeorge: of course. \\n\\njerry: okay? so, she\\'s taking about her panties, so, uh.. so, i said, \"you mean the panties your mother laid out for you?\" \\n\\ngeorge: (takes a few seconds to mull this one over. shooting jerry a confused look, he repeats it) \"the panties your mother laid out for you\"? (jerry nods) what does that mean? \\n\\njerry: (throwing up his hands) i don\\'t know! it just popped out. \\n\\ngeorge: well, how did she react? \\n\\njerry: she flipped out! just left. \\n\\ngeorge: well, that\\'s not offensive. (reflects) it\\'s abnormal, but it\\'s not offensive. \\n\\njerry: look, the main thing is i don\\'t want elaine to know about any of this. i mean, especially the panty remark. i mean, it\\'s embarrassing. and she\\'s never let me hear the end of it. \\n\\njerry: she will tell her. she\\'s going back to work. i talked her into it - how stupid was that? (changing subject as they both collect money to pay for the check) hey, so, susan\\'s father took that news pretty hard, huh? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, yeah. he went into the bedroom and started sobbing. \\n\\njerry: i guess he failed to see the humor in it. \\n\\ngeorge: huh. (makes a \"over his head\" gesture with his arm) c\\'mon, let\\'s go, go. we got a lot of work to do today. \\n\\njerry: (getting up) alright, big work day. \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s right. \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\ngeorge: okay. \\n\\njerry: let\\'s go. \\n\\ngeorge: here we are. \\n\\njerry: right now. \\n\\ngeorge: let\\'s do it. \\n\\njerry: you and me. \\n\\ngeorge: okay. \\n\\njerry: alright. \\n\\ngeorge: what\\'dya got? \\n\\njerry: (reading from his notebook) i got you enter, you go \"hi\", and i go, \"hello.\" now.. we need something here.. \\n\\nkramer: oh, hey. \\n\\ngeorge: don\\'t be silly. \\n\\njerry: come in, we\\'re taking a break. \\n\\nkramer: (moving back into the room) oh, yeah? \\n\\njerry: yeah! \\n\\nkramer: uh, george, did you talk to that guy about getting me some more cigars? \\n\\ngeorge: (scoffs) no, i told you, i\\'m not gonna do that. \\n\\nkramer: (concluding) okay.. well, i guess i\\'m just going to have to take matters into my own hands, huh? (pause) alright, i\\'ll see you guys. (leaves, despite \"no, don\\'t go!\" and other various comments by jerry and george) \\n\\n[setting: united nations\\' permanent mission of cuba building] \\n\\nkramer: buenos dias. \\n\\nsecretary: buenos dias. \\n\\nkramer: uh, habla ingles? \\n\\nsecretary: si. \\n\\nkramer: giddy-up. ok, uh, (looks at a woman wearing dark sunglasses and sitting on a sofa behind him. he reacts oddly) um. i need to talk to someone. \\n\\nsecretary: what is this about? \\n\\nkramer: uh, well, it\\'s a very private matter, but it\\'s extremely urgent. \\n\\nsecretary: are you an american? \\n\\nkramer: oh, yeah. \\n\\nsecretary: i see.. excuse me. (picks up the phone) \\n\\nkramer: okay. \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\njerry: (stirring, he gets up to answer the buzzer) alright, let\\'s get going. c\\'mon, c\\'mon now. (approaches the intercom) c\\'mon, let\\'s get it together.. (through intercom) yeah? \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s elaine. \\n\\njerry: c\\'mon up. (slightly opens the door for elaine) \\n\\ngeorge: (standing up, still waking up) alright, you know what we should do? we should go to the movies. get away from this script for a while.. \\n\\njerry: (agreeing) yeah, we should. \\n\\ngeorge: alright, i just have to go over to the ross\\' apartment and drop off susan\\'s sunglasses. you\\'ll come with me? \\n\\njerry: yeah. wha - what, does she live with them? \\n\\ngeorge: no, no, no, no. \\n\\njerry: oh. \\n\\nelaine: hey, nice going, jerome seinfeld! \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nelaine: i just got a message from sandra, she\\'s coming back to work. \\n\\njerry: well, then, you\\'ve just got to fire her! don\\'t even think about it - there\\'s no two ways about it. \\n\\nelaine: why? what happened? did you talk? \\n\\njerry: talk? did i talk? it - you\\'re darn right i talk to her! we talked up a storm - and i concluded from the basis of these talks that this isn\\'t anybody you should be talking to. \\n\\nelaine: really? \\n\\njerry: yes. \\n\\nelaine: really? you really think i should fire her? \\n\\njerry: oh yeah. yeah, in fact, if george and i weren\\'t so busy here working on the script, i\\'d do it myself. \\n\\n[setting: united nations\\' permanent mission of cuba building] \\n\\nman: (to secretary) expira te afuera. \\n\\nkramer: (standing up, greeting the men) buenos dias. \\n\\nman: what is your name, senor? \\n\\nkramer: uh, kramer. \\n\\nman: so, senor kramer, what is this about? \\n\\nkramer: (leaning in, confidentially) cigars. \\n\\nman: (confused) cigars? \\n\\nkramer: (definite) cigars. \\n\\nman: what about cigars? \\n\\nkramer: uh, see here, i.. (pulls out a paper ring from his pocket) i saved one of the cigar rings.. \\n\\nman: ohh..

(hands them to her) \\n\\nsusan: ok, thanks. come on in for a second. (they move into the living room. susan gestures to a man sitting on the couch reading the paper) this is my brother, ricky. he\\'s home from college for the weekend. \\n\\ngeorge: ohh, hey there, young fella. (they shake hands) what\\'s your major? \\n\\nricky: (blunt) i don\\'t have one. \\n\\ngeorge: well, you should always consider podiatry. (patting ricky on the shoulder) there\\'s nothing wrong with the feet. (ricky looks critically back at george) \\n\\nsusan: (now gestures to an old woman in a wheelchair) and this is my aunt, sara. \\n\\nsara: (staring at george) he doesn\\'t look like me. \\n\\nmrs. ross: sara, what do you have on your wheels? \\n\\nsara: nothing, they\\'re clean. \\n\\nmrs. ross: ricky, did you wipe her wheels off? \\n\\nricky: (annoyed) yes. \\n\\nmrs. ross: (concluding) well, they\\'re filthy. it\\'s just a matter of common courtesy.. (wheels sara over to a spot off the rug) when you come in the house you wipe your wheels. \\n\\nsusan: excuse me. (answer the door. it\\'s her doorman, raymond, carrying a burnt box) hello, raymond. \\n\\nraymond: ah, yes, the man from the insurance company dropped this off this morning. he said it was the only thing left from the remains of the fire. \\n\\nsusan: (accepts the box) oh, thank you. (as the doorman leaves, she turns to jerry and george) wow, i\\'ve never seen this before.. (opens the charred box) oh, they\\'re letters. (hands the box to george) here. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, sure. (holds the box out as susan takes out a few letters) \\n\\nsusan: from.. (trying to read one) from john cheever. \\n\\njerry and george: oh, wow. \\n\\nsusan: (chuckles as she opens up one of the letters. she reads it) \"dear henry, last night with you was bliss. i fear my.. orgasm (she now has everyone\\'s attention) has left me a cripple. i don\\'t how how i shall ever get back to work.. (jerry and george make odd faces as susan is still concentrating on the notes) i love you madly, john. (pause) p.s. loved the cabin.\" (george nods, and jerry gives a \"oh, of course\" reaction) \\n\\ngeorge: well, we.. we, we, ah.. \\n\\njerry: (looking at his watch ) yeah.. \\n\\ngeorge: we really should be, uh, heading out.. \\n\\njerry: yeah. (tapping his watch) look at the time. \\n\\ngeorge: you know, the time.. \\n\\nmr. ross: the box! (rushes toward george, grabbing the box away from him, then the letters from susan\\'s hands) my letters! gimme that! (now holding them against his chest, defensively) who told you to open this?! \\n\\nmrs. ross: (hysterical) who\\'s john?! who\\'s john?! \\n\\nsara: (yelling out) i knew it! \\n\\nmrs. ross: i want to know who john is! \\n\\nrickey: john cheever?! dad, you and john cheever?! \\n\\nmr. ross: (proclaiming) yes! yes, he was the most wonderful person i\\'ve ever known. and i love him deeply! in a way you could never understand.. (slowly walks back to his room, leaving everyone speechless. susan seems to be affected the most. a long pause passes. jerry gives george a signal that they should go) \\n\\ngeorge: well, we really should be- \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: uh, heading out. jerry really hates to miss the coming attractions. \\n\\njerry: yeah, and, (pointing to his watch) because of the.. (slowly exiting) time. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, time is what he\\'s indicating there.. \\n\\njerry: (waving good bye) we\\'ll see ya. \\n\\ngeorge: uh, anyway, (waving bye to everyone) onward and upward. \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\ngeorge: alright, here we go. \\n\\njerry: alright, let\\'s go. \\n\\ngeorge: come on now. \\n\\njerry: right now. \\n\\ngeorge: here we go. \\n\\njerry: you and me. \\n\\ngeorge: you got it. \\n\\njerry: no foolin\\' \\n\\ngeorge: ok, so, what\\'dya got? \\n\\njerry: (looking at his notebook) alright, i got, uh, you come in, you say \"hi\", and i say \"hello\". \\n\\ngeorge: alright, so, we need something.. \\n\\njerry: yeah.. how about this i say \"how\\'s it goin\\'?\" \\n\\ngeorge: \"how\\'s it going?\" - beautiful. \\n\\njerry: (getting up to answer the door) alright, did you get that line? \\n\\ngeorge: (nodding, writing) \"how\\'s it going?\" \\n\\njerry: did you write it down? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m writin\\' it. \"how\\'s it going?\" \\n\\njerry: okay..

oh man!\" \\n\\njerry: (singing) camera, curtains, lights - this is it, we\\'ll hit the heights - oh what heights we\\'ll hit - on with the show this is it! \\n\\nelaine: you know, it is so sad, all your knowledge of high culture comes from bugs bunny cartoons. \\n\\njerry: oh there\\'s that clown again, what does he want from me. look i?m serious, i?m not kidding, i don\\'t have the quarter, that guy took it. \\n\\njoe divola: i don\\'t want any money. \\n\\nelaine: i smell cherry. \\n\\njoe divola: it\\'s binaca. \\n\\njerry: binaca?

\\n\\nsusan: my friend\\'s flight couldn?t make it. \\n\\njerry: where\\'s george? \\n\\nman#3: i got his ticket. \\n\\nsusan: he decided not to come. he said he was uncomfortable. \\n\\njerry: uncomfortable? how does you think i feel?.. hey let me ask you something, how much did you pay for that ticket? \\n\\nman#3: one seventy-five. \\n\\njerry: kramer, who\\'d you sell your ticket to? \\n\\nkramer: some nut in a clown suit! \\n\\njerry: i had some friends drag me to an opera recently, you know how they\\'ve got those little opera glasses, you know, do you really need binoculars, i mean how big do these people have to get before you can spot \\'em. these opera kids they\\'re going two-fifty, two-eighty, three-twenty-five, they\\'re wearing big white woolly vests, the women have like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out. if you can\\'t pick these people out, forget opera, think about optometry, maybe that?s more you\\'re thing. \\n\\njerry: we\\'re dead. \\n\\ngeorge: we\\'re not dead. \\n\\njerry: we are dead. \\n\\ngeorge: come on. we got all day tomorrow to come up with a story. \\n\\njerry: all day tomorrow? we had a month and a half to come up with something and we didn\\'t do anything. \\n\\ngeorge: so we\\'ll do it tomorrow. \\n\\njerry: let me ask you something. when\\'s the last time you went skiing? \\n\\ngeorge: about six years ago. \\n\\njerry: i think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now. \\n\\ngeorge: women like skiers. \\n\\njerry: so what? you can\\'t meet anybody. you\\'re going on with susan. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. right. \\n\\njerry: hey, see those two women over there? i almost dated the one on the right. she\\'s in the closet business. \\n\\ngeorge: the closet business? what\\'s the closet business? \\n\\njerry: what is it your business? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m interested. \\n\\njerry: she reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space. she looked into my closet. \\n\\ngeorge: so you thought she was good looking and figured this would be a good way to meet her. \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. so what happened? \\n\\njerry: so, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. what do i need more closet space for? (across the room) hi, marla. \\n\\nmarla: (walks over to jerry and george) jerry. \\n\\njerry: george, marla. \\n\\ngeorge: marla. \\n\\nmarla: george. jerry, stacey. \\n\\njerry: stacey. \\n\\nstacey: jerry. \\n\\njerry: george, stacey. \\n\\ngeorge: stacey. \\n\\nstacey: george. \\n\\njerry: george. \\n\\ngeorge: jerry. marla. (realizing jerry\\'s cue) stacey! (walks over to stacey) \\n\\nmarla: so, how was your trip to berlin? \\n\\njerry: trip to berlin? \\n\\nmarla: remember? that\\'s why you put off doing the closets. you said you were going to berlin for a while. \\n\\njerry: oh, right, right. \\n\\nmarla: the wall had just come down, and you told me you wanted to be part of the celebration. \\n\\njerry: yes, yes, i did. but, you know, i was watching it on cnn, and they covered it so well i thought, \"why knock my brains out?\" \\n\\nmarla: you, know my boyfriend went. \\n\\njerry: really? \\n\\nmarla: yes, i told him all about you going and he got all excited and decided to go. \\n\\njerry: oh, did he like it? \\n\\nmarla: i don\\'t know. he never came back. (over to the other side of the bar) \\n\\ngeorge: anyway, we met with nbc about a month ago and they gave us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. in fact, we got a big meeting with them tomorrow. they gotta approve of the story before we can write. \\n\\nstacey: wow, what a great job. a writer. \\n\\ngeorge: not a bad way to make a buck. \\n\\nstacey: sounds great. \\n\\ngeorge: well, i\\'ll tell you, stacey. it\\'s a lot of hard work. but, it comes fairly easy to me. some people write symphonies. this is my gift. (raises ski lift ticket while stacey looks away) \\n\\njerry: so, are you gonna go out with her? \\n\\ngeorge: i might. \\n\\njerry: what about susan? \\n\\ngeorge: what? i\\'m not married. i\\'m not allowed to go out with somebody else? \\n\\njerry: depends. \\n\\ngeorge: depends on what? \\n\\njerry: on many factors. \\n\\ngeorge: like what? \\n\\njerry: well, how long you\\'ve been seeing her. what\\'s your phone call frequency? are you on a daily? \\n\\ngeorge: no. semi-daily. four or five times a week. \\n\\njerry: what about saturday nights? do you have to ask her out, or is a date implied? \\n\\ngeorge: implied. \\n\\njerry: she got anything in your medicine cabinet? \\n\\ngeorge: there might be some moisturizer. \\n\\njerry: ah hah. let me ask you this. is there any tampax in your house? \\n\\ngeorge: (pause) yeah. \\n\\njerry: well, i\\'ll tell you what you\\'ve got here. \\n\\ngeorge: what? \\n\\njerry: you got yourself a girlfriend. \\n\\ngeorge: ah, no, no. are you sure? a girlfriend? \\n\\njerry: i\\'m looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on saturday night. i would like to help you out, but... \\n\\ngeorge: would you believe my luck? the first time in my life i have a good answer to the question, \"what do you do?\" and i have a girlfriend. i mean, you don\\'t need a girlfriend when you can answer that question. that\\'s what you say in order to get girlfriends. once you can get a girlfriend, you don\\'t want a girlfriend, you just want more girlfriends. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re going to make a good father someday. \\n\\ngeorge: well it\\'s not fair, jerry. it\\'s just not fair. all right, all right. that\\'s it. i\\'m getting out of this thing. \\n\\njerry: fine. break up with her. but you know what this means? \\n\\ngeorge: no, what? \\n\\njerry: the script, the pilot, the tv show. that\\'s all over. \\n\\ngeorge: why? what do you mean? \\n\\njerry: figure it out. she\\'s one of the executives at nbc that\\'s gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. she\\'s one of our biggest fans. you drop her off, you think they\\'re gonna pick us up? \\n\\ngeorge: oh, right. oh no, man. \\n\\njerry: you know, it\\'s a very interesting situation. here you have a job that can get you girls. but, you also have a relationship. but if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls, you lose the job. you see the irony? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, yeah. i see the irony. all right. what about this? what if i can find some way to break up with her so that she\\'ll still like me and it doesn\\'t affect the deal. \\n\\njerry: (sarcastically) oh, yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: wait, wait. here me out. don\\'t dismiss this. you\\'re very quick to dismiss. don\\'t dismiss. she\\'s got a big crush on david letterman, i mean, a big crush. she talks about him all the time. suppose i go up to david letterman. he works at nbc; i work at nbc. i explain my situation. he agrees to meet her. they go out, they fall madly in love. and she dumps me for david letterman. \\n\\njerry: this is your plan? \\n\\ngeorge: no, no. i\\'m just thinking. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t think you are. \\n\\nmarla: let me tell you what i think. \\n\\njerry: please, and be brutal. i have no closet sensitivity. \\n\\nmarla: are you very fussy about your pants? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t think i am. \\n\\nmarla: because i have a very radical idea. can you handle it? \\n\\njerry: try me. \\n\\nmarla: here\\'s what i\\'m proposing. we eliminate all this. the hangers, the bar, the shelves. and in its place install a series of hooks. we\\'ll put everything on hooks. \\n\\njerry: everything? \\n\\nmarla: everything. the shirts, pants, sport jackets, pajamas. we could get eighty hooks on here. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re quite mad, you know.

(marla enters from other room) \\n\\nkramer: well, wow. \\n\\njerry: marla, kramer. \\n\\nkramer: hey. \\n\\njerry: why don\\'t you go out? it\\'s nice out. \\n\\nkramer: oh, no. there\\'s nothing out there for me. \\n\\njerry: there\\'s weather. \\n\\nkramer: weather? i don\\'t need weather. weather doesn\\'t do it for me. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m tellin\\' george to give you your tv back. \\n\\nkramer: no, no, i don\\'t want it back.

(knock of jerry\\'s door) \\n\\njerry: (getting the door) that\\'s the stupidest idea i ever heard. sentenced to be a butler.

(acts it out) my back! my back! i can\\'t believe, my back. \\n\\njerry: no, no, would you get up? \\n\\ngeorge: i can do this, jerry. \\n\\njerry: no. \\n\\ngeorge: all right, i\\'ll tell them my sister died. (starts fake crying) my poor sister died. she was standing and then she was laughing and then they shot her! that\\'s the kind of sick city that we\\'re livin\\' in. they shoot you for laughing. i must go and comfort my poor family. jerry, take me home so i can comfort my... my poor family. \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s david letterman. i just saw david letterman walk by. i\\'ll be right back. (he exits) \\n\\nwoman: mr. seinfeld, they\\'re ready for you. (she exits) \\n\\njerry: yes, i was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. (jerry enters meeting) \\n\\nman #1: hey, jerry. \\n\\njerry: hi, how are you doing? nice to see you all here. hello. \\n\\nrita: hello, jerry. i\\'m rita kearson. \\n\\njerry: oh, uh, nice to meet you. where\\'s russell? \\n\\nrita: he, uh, had to go to la. there\\'s a problem on the set of blossom. \\n\\njerry: oh, poor blossom.

(pause) \\n\\njerry: have you ever been to a chinese restaurant and they tell you it\\'ll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin\\' there for, like, thirty minutes? well, we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you\\'re doin\\' is waitin\\' for the table. (they don\\'t seem to like it) because we\\'ve all been in that situation. you know, you\\'re waiting... and you\\'re hungry... and you bump into somebody you know... when is russell coming back? \\n\\nrita: so that\\'s the idea? \\n\\njerry: well no, that\\'s one. we have many others. we have an idea where, uh, i get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler. (everyone laughs) you know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... he cleans my house, he\\'s doin\\' my shopping, you know? i\\'m walkin\\' around with one of those big neck collars. \\n\\nman #2: those collars are funny! \\n\\nman #1: once you see someone in those collars you start laughing immediately. (george enters) \\n\\ngeorge: you tellin\\' \\'em about the butler story? is that beautiful or what? hey, sorry i\\'m late.

(aside to jerry) i thought i was getting the butler. \\n\\njerry: don\\'t worry, uh, we\\'ll find something for you. \\n\\njerry: so letterman didn\\'t spark to your idea, huh? \\n\\ngeorge: no, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time i should probably break the prozacs in half. \\n\\nkramer: you, you guys wanna hold it down? i\\'m watchin\\' jeopardy. \\n\\njerry: would you give him the tv back? \\n\\nkramer: oh, by the way, george. susan called for you a minute ago. \\n\\ngeorge: i bet they\\'re probably doing summersaults about us over there. you think they get butler stories like that everyday? (he calls susan) \\n\\nkramer: (to the tv) who is joseph cotton? giddee up! \\n\\nsusan: hello? \\n\\ngeorge: hi, it\\'s me. it\\'s georgie boy. what\\'s going on? \\n\\nsusan: what\\'s going on? what\\'s going on? i\\'ll tell you what\\'s going on. i\\'m fired! \\n\\ngeorge: fired? why? \\n\\nsusan: because you kissed me. you kissed me, you stupid idiot! rita called russell and he fired me over the phone. \\n\\nkramer: (to the tv) what is pi? ooh! giddee up again. \\n\\ngeorge: but i had no... i didn\\'t realize. \\n\\nsusan: you didn\\'t realize? how could you not realize? you\\'re stupid! you\\'re a stupid, stupid man! \\n\\ngeorge: i just feel terrible this is just terrible. \\n\\nkramer: (to the tv once again) what is the cha-cha? ooh, yes indeed. \\n\\nsusan: i\\'ll speak to you later. \\n\\ngeorge: (hangs up phone and pauses) this is great! he fired her! this is incredible, he fired her. i\\'m out, baby! i\\'m out! \\n\\njerry: why did he fire her? \\n\\ngeorge: because i kissed her in the meeting. russell found out, he fired her over the phone. finally, my stupidity pays off! \\n\\nkramer: what is here comes the judge, here comes the judge! \\n\\njerry: you can\\'t break up with her now. her life is shattered. you got her fired. you gotta be there for her. \\n\\ngeorge: what? \\n\\njerry: you gotta at least wait until she gets another job. \\n\\ngeorge: another job? \\n\\njerry: couple of interviews. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, this is unbelievable. i\\'m stuck. every time i think i\\'m out, they pull me back in. \\n\\nmarla: are you gonna leave after its over? you know, if we have sex. \\n\\njerry: what? leave? where? why? \\n\\nmarla: you know, the apartment. \\n\\njerry: why would i leave? this is my apartment. \\n\\nmarla: well what if it was my apartment? \\n\\njerry: who gave you this idea i would wanna leave? \\n\\nmarla: well elaine said men like to leave after it\\'s over. \\n\\njerry: listen, i wouldn\\'t put too much stock into what elaine has to say about relationships. she comes from a broken home, and i mean that literally. a tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole structure. her parents got along beautifully, but her house was in bad shape. \\n\\nmarla: maybe i should get going. \\n\\njerry: what else did you say to her? \\n\\nelaine: nothin\\'. i was just givin\\' her the straight dope. \\n\\njerry: more like a dope was giving it to her straight. another cup of coffee with you, she\\'ll wind up in a convent. \\n\\nelaine: listen, there was a lot more i could\\'ve told her, believe me. \\n\\njerry: what is that about leaving after sex? did i ever leave with you? \\n\\nelaine: you might\\'ve if i\\'d stayed. so you know what? i got served with papers today. ping is suing me. i need your virgin as a witness. you better be nice to her. \\n\\njerry: i was trying to be. \\n\\nelaine: look at george. (on the other side of the restaurant) he lucked out, huh? \\n\\njerry: oh, you\\'re not kiddin\\'. who\\'d \\'ve figured susan would break up with him? they had a good thing going. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, since she met him she\\'s been vomited on, her family cabin\\'s been burned down, she learned her father\\'s a homosexual, and she got fired from a high paying network job. yeah, they had a real good thing going. \\n\\ngeorge: what do i do? well actually, i\\'m a writer. in fact, i\\'m writing a comedy pilot for nbc right now. \\n\\nwoman: a sitcom? how can you write that crap? carol, this guy\\'s writing a sitcom. \\n\\ncarol: a sitcom? come on, let\\'s go.

(all three give him blank stares) i was alone.. \\n\\nelaine: (making a face of surprise) you mean..?! \\n\\ngeorge: (nods) uh-huh. \\n\\nkramer: (laughing) she caught you? \\n\\njerry: where? \\n\\ngeorge: (not really wanting to embellish) ..i stopped by the house to drop the car off, and i went inside for a few minutes.. nobody was there - they\\'re supposed to be working. (jerry and elaine look at each other - enjoying the story) my mother had a glamour magazine, i started leafing through it.. \\n\\njerry: \"glamour\"? \\n\\ngeorge: ..so, one thing lead to another.. \\n\\njerry: so, what did she do? \\n\\ngeorge: first she screams, \"george, what are you doing?! my god!\" and it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it. \\n\\nkrmaer: (reflecting on the story so far) man.. \\n\\ngeorge: i didn\\'t know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up. \\n\\njerry: what did you do? \\n\\ngeorge: i zipped up! \\n\\nelaine: (wide-eyed) so, she fell? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. (noticing this makes him out to be the bad kid, he gets defensive) well, i couldn\\'t run over there the way i was! \\n\\nelaine: no, i guess you couldn\\'t have.. \\n\\njerry: (in the middle of elaine\\'s sentence, smiling) no, i wouldn\\'t think so. \\n\\nelaine: (finishing it off) ..done that. \\n\\ngeorge: so, she fell, and then she started screaming, \"my back! my back!\" so, i picked her up and took her to the hospital. \\n\\nelaine: (between chuckles) how is she? \\n\\ngeorge: (somewhat angered) she\\'s in traction. \\n\\nelaine: (still laughing) ok, i\\'m sorry. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s not funny, elaine. \\n\\nelaine: (stifling her laughter) i know. i\\'m sorry. i\\'m serious. \\n\\ngeorge: her back went out. she\\'s gotta be there for a couple of days. all she said on the way over in the car was, \"why, george, why?!\".. i said, \"because it\\'s there!\" \\n\\njerry: \"glamour\"? \\n\\ngeorge: (vowing) well, i\\'ll tell you this, though - i am never doing.. that , again. \\n\\nelaine: what, you mean, in your mother\\'s house, or all together? \\n\\ngeorge: (definite) all together. \\n\\nelaine: oh, gimme a break.. \\n\\njerry: (skeptical) ohhh yeah.. right. \\n\\nkramer: oh, like you\\'re gonna stop? \\n\\njerry and elaine: c\\'mon.. \\n\\ngeorge: you don\\'t think i can? \\n\\njerry: no chance. \\n\\ngeorge: (daring) you think you could? \\n\\njerry: well, i know i could hold out longer than you. \\n\\ngeorge: care to make it interesting? \\n\\njerry: sure, how much? \\n\\ngeorge: a hundred dollars. \\n\\njerry: (pointing) you\\'re on. \\n\\nkramer: (butting in) wait a second, wait a second. count me in on this.

(more \\'no, no, no\\'s from jerry and george. persistent) why? \\n\\njerry: because you\\'re a woman! \\n\\nelaine: so what? \\n\\njerry: it\\'s easier for a woman not to do it than a man. \\n\\nelaine: (sarcastic) oh. \\n\\njerry: we have to do it. it\\'s part of our lifestyle. it\\'s like, uh.. shaving. \\n\\nelaine: oh, that is such bologna. i shave my legs. \\n\\nkramer: (making a point) not everyday. \\n\\ngeorge: alright, look, you want to be in? \\n\\nelaine: yeah! \\n\\ngeorge: you gotta give us odds. at least two to one - you gotta put up two-hundred dollars. \\n\\nkramer: no, a thousand! \\n\\nelaine: no, i\\'ll - i\\'ll put up one-fifty. \\n\\ngeorge: alright, you\\'re in for one-fifty. \\n\\njerry: (nodding) okay, one-fifty. \\n\\ngeorge: alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing? \\n\\njerry: well, obviously, we all know each other very well, (elaine slightly laughs) i\\'m sure that we\\'ll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system. \\n\\nkramer: alright.

(giddy and nearly out of breath) so we\\'re walkin\\' and talkin\\', and he asked me my name - and i think i said elaine - but, i mean, who the hell knows.. and so then, he says to me \"do you wanna split a cab uptown?\" and i said, \"sure\" - even though i was going downtown. so, we get in the cab, and i mean, i have no idea where i\\'m goin\\', right? but this is john f. kennedy junior we\\'re talkin\\' about! (deep breath) so, then, he says to me, \"where do you live?\" and i - and i - and i was close to your block, so i said your building. so he dropped me off in front, (laughs) and i had to take a cab all the way back downtown to my house.. (picks up a glass of cold water and presses it up to her forehead to cool her off) oh, god.. \\n\\njerry: but the question is, are you still master of your domain? \\n\\nelaine: (sets the glass down) i\\'m queen of the castle. (pops a piece of food into her mouth) \\n\\n[setting: estelle\\'s hospital room] \\n\\nestelle: you\\'re back. \\n\\ngeorge: of course i\\'m back. why wouldn\\'t i be back? my mother\\'s in the hospital, i\\'m going to pay her a visit. \\n\\nestelle: i know, but two days in a row? you didn\\'t have to do this. \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'re my mother! what wouldn\\'t i do for you? \\n\\nestelle: you know what you could do? i haven\\'t eaten lunch or dinner. i can\\'t eat this hospital food. maybe you could run down to the deli and get me a sandwich.. \\n\\ngeorge: (smiling) you got it, ma. (she smiles back, nodding) a little later. (george sits back in a nearby chair, looking at the divider in anticipation) \\n\\nestelle: (let down) could you go now, george? i\\'m very hungry. i\\'m weak. \\n\\ngeorge: well, wait a little while, ma. what\\'s the difference? \\n\\nestelle: i don\\'t understand why you can\\'t do this for me! \\n\\ngeorge: (standing up) i just got here, ma! i\\'d like to spend a little time with you. \\n\\nestelle: but if you wait, they won\\'t let you back in! visiting hours are almost over! \\n\\ngeorge: ten minutes! here, here, (fishes a box of tic-tacs out of his coat pocket and tosses them to her) have some tic-tacs. \\n\\nestelle: get the hell outta here.

(turns to put a stack of shorts away) \\n\\nelaine: no! no! now! tell me now! what did he say?! \\n\\njoyce: (uneasy) he asked about you. \\n\\nelaine: (ecstatic) he asked about me? john kennedy asked about me?! (hangs off the side of the counter, both feet in the air) what did he say? \\n\\njoyce: he wanted to know your situation. \\n\\nelaine: (quick) what situation? i have a situation? \\n\\njoyce: i-i told him you were single. \\n\\nelaine: that was good. that was very good. \\n\\njoyce: he said you were just his type. \\n\\nelaine: (frank) okay, you tryin\\' to hurt me? are you tryin\\' to hurt - you\\'re tryin\\' to injure me, right? you\\'re trying to hurt me. \\n\\njoyce: he also told me to tell you that he\\'ll be in your neighborhood tomorrow around nine o\\' clock - so he\\'s gonna stop in front of your building if you want to come down and say hello. \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\njerry: alright, ma, i\\'ll talk to you later.. nothing, i\\'m, i\\'m watching, uh, tiny toons here, on nickelodeon.. it\\'s, i-i like kid shows. they have a very innocent, wholesome quality. okay, alright, i\\'ll talk to you later. bye.

(opens his door for elaine) \\n\\ngeorge: where did you get those socks? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know. \\n\\ngeorge: i think those are my socks! \\n\\njerry: how are these your socks?! \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t know, but those are my socks! i had a pair just like that with the blue stripe, and now i don\\'t have them anymore! \\n\\njerry: (sarcastic) oh, yeah, that\\'s right, well, you fell asleep one day on the sofa and i took them off your stinkin\\' feet. they looked so good to me, i just had to have them! \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, well, they\\'re my socks! \\n\\njerry: they\\'re my socks! \\n\\ngeorge: oh boy.. \\n\\njerry: what are we doing here.. \\n\\ngeorge: ..oh boy. \\n\\njerry: this is ridiculous. \\n\\ngeorge: do you believe this? we\\'re fighting. we\\'re fighting. \\n\\njerry: i haven\\'t been myself lately. i\\'ve been snapping at everybody. \\n\\ngeorge: me too. i\\'ve been yelling at strangers on the street. \\n\\nelaine: hello..

[to skycap] excuse me, my friend and i here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you usually get for a tip. \\n\\nskycap: depends on the person, depends on the bag. \\n\\njerry: uh, how about a couple of people like us. \\n\\nskycap: people like you? i wouldn\\'t expect much, you don\\'t even look like you know what you\\'re doing... \\n\\njerry: c\\'mon, seriously... \\n\\nskycap: well, since you asked, usually, i get five dollars a bag. \\n\\nelaine: what!? \\n\\nskycap: that\\'s right. \\n\\nelaine: *five* dollars a bag? i don\\'t think so. \\n\\nskycap: look, you asked, i told you. \\n\\nelaine: you got some nerve trying to take advantage of us... \\n\\njerry: all right, look, we\\'re late. thank you very much... \\n\\nelaine: you\\'re lucky i don\\'t report you... \\n\\nskycap: jfk... \\n\\nskycap: ...honolulu. \\n\\nelaine: wait up! \\n\\njerry: you see? never be late for a plane with a girl. \\'cuz a girl runs like a girl-- with the little steps and the arms flailing out... you wanna make this plane, you\\'ve gotta run like a man! get your knees up! \\n\\njerry & elaine: the flight\\'s been canceled?!?! \\n\\nticket lady: everything into jfk\\'s booked... no, wait-- i have two seats into laguardia-- but they\\'re not together. it\\'s boarding right now. \\n\\njerry: we\\'ll take \\'em! \\n\\nelaine: we\\'re not going to sit together? \\n\\njerry: well, so what? it\\'s not that long-- you\\'ll read. \\n\\nelaine: well, what about george? he\\'s supposed to pick us up at kennedy. \\n\\njerry: we\\'ll call him... \\n\\nelaine: there\\'s no time. \\n\\njerry: no time? [to ticket lady] is there time? \\n\\nticket lady: there\\'s no time. \\n\\njerry: there\\'s no time. all right, we\\'ll call him from the plane. \\n\\nticket lady: i have one seat in first class, and one in coach. the price is the same since your flight was canceled. \\n\\n(the two have that uncomfortable politeness that only comes about when you\\'re down to the last piece of pizza. jerry breaks the silence: ) \\n\\njerry: i\\'ll take the first class. \\n\\nelaine: jerry! \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nelaine: why should you get the first class? \\n\\njerry: elaine, have you ever flown first class? \\n\\nelaine: no. \\n\\njerry: all right then. see? you won\\'t know what you\\'re missing. i\\'ve flown first class, elaine-- i can\\'t go back to coach. i can\\'t... i won\\'t... \\n\\nelaine: you flew here coach. \\n\\njerry: yeah, that\\'s a point... \\n\\nelaine: all right, fine. i don\\'t care. if the plane crashes, everybody in first class is going to die, anyway. \\n\\njerry: yeah, i\\'m sure you\\'ll live. \\n\\nattendant #1: third row right... \\n\\nattendant #1: oh, you\\'re in here, sir. welcome aboard. \\n\\njerry: bon voyage, lainey! \\n\\n(elaine is robbed of her peek into the first class section by a drawn curtain and she goes to her seat. however, someone comes after her and: ) \\n\\npassenger #1: oh, excuse me... um, excuse me, miss, i think you\\'re sitting in my seat... \\n\\npassenger #1: i never check my bags-- i can\\'t stand that wait in the baggage area. \\n\\nelaine: great...

[to himself] thank... *you*! \\n\\ngeorge: hey, thanks for coming with me. \\n\\nkramer: hey, what made you think you could touch that awning? \\n\\ngeorge: i confused it with another awning. \\n\\nkramer: so how we doin\\' on time? \\n\\ngeorge: we\\'re perfect. i timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. that gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal as we roll up. i tell you, it\\'s a thing of beauty. i can not express to you the feeling i get from a perfect airport pickup. (starts looking around) what\\'s going on? what are you doing? the long island expressway? what are you getting on the long island expressway for? do you know what the traffic will be like? this is a suicide mission! \\n\\nkramer: will you relax?! \\n\\ngeorge: oh, i had it perfectly timed out the grand central, the van wyck! you destroyed my whole timing! \\n\\nkramer: this is the best way to go! \\n\\ngeorge: do you know what happens if i miss him? i don\\'t get credit for the pickup and i lose my 50 bucks... \\n\\nkramer: george, there\\'s no traffic at this time. now, come on, man... \\n\\ngeorge: really? \\n\\nkramer: if anything, we\\'ll probably get there early. i\\'ll have a chance to go to the duty free shop. \\n\\ngeorge: the duty free shop? duty free is the biggest sucker deal in retail. do you know how much duty is? \\n\\nkramer: duty. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, \"duty\". do you know how much duty is? \\n\\nkramer: no, i dunno how much duty is. \\n\\ngeorge: duty is *nothing*. it\\'s like sales tax... \\n\\nkramer: i still like to stop at the duty free shop. \\n\\ngeorge: i like to stop at the duty free shop. \\n\\n(they start to \"sing\", growing more excited after each iteration: ) \\n\\ngeorge & kramer: i like to stop at the duty free shop! \\n\\ntia: so, he says, ``squeeze your breasts together\\'\\', and i say, ``i thought this was an ad for shoes\\'\\'... \\n\\njerry: oh my... \\n\\ntia: is that the new esquire? turn to page 146. \\n\\njerry: wow! coming out of the shower... it\\'s a good thing they gave you that washcloth to cover yourself up... what is this an ad for? \\n\\ntia: see those wrinkled jeans slung over the chair? way in the background, out of focus? \\n\\njerry: uh-huh... \\n\\nkramer: how does it look on your side?

(turns toward the elevators) \\n\\njerry: but there - but there was no pick! i - i did not pick! there ws no piick! \\n\\ntia: i gotta go.

(phone rings, she puts it on speakerphone) yeah?.. \\n\\nreceptionist: your sister, gail. \\n\\nelaine: oh, god - my nephew. (picks up the phone and hits the button) hi, gail!.. yu.. yu... yes, gail, i know how old he is. \\n\\nco-worker: (pokes his head into the doorway) hey, nip, ya need that manuscript or can i take it home? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, take it! take it!.. an\\' stop calling me \"nip\"! (co-worker takes it and quickly leaves. elaine goes back to the phone) it was an accident! well.. well.. it\\'s gotta be somewhere. look under his mattress. \\n\\n[setting: susan\\'s apartment building] \\n\\n[setting: calvin klein\\'s office] \\n\\nwoman: about the focus group? i had nothing to do with the focus group. what\\'s your point? (she sees kramer emerge from another room. he\\'s wearing only dress shoes, socks, and his briefs) my.. he\\'s sexual, athletic.. an\\' without a trace of self-consciousness! \\n\\nklein: his buttocks are sublime! \\n\\nman: of course, his pectorals could use a little work - i suppose we could get him into the weight room. \\n\\nwoman: (mesmerized with kramer\\'s body) no, let\\'s get him in the studio today. we can send these out immediately. \\n\\nman: you\\'ve done it again, c.k.! \\n\\n[setting: calvin klein office building] \\n\\njerry: an\\' what if i did do it? even though i admit to nothing, and never will. what does that make me? and i\\'m not here just defending myself but all those pickers out there who\\'ve been caught. (elevator doors open) each an\\' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame and humiliation because of people like you.. (everyone but jerry is now in the elevator. jerry\\'s still addressing them) are we not human?! if we pick, do we not bleed?! (elevator doors shut. a few people in the hallway are looking at him, he turns and addresses them) i am not an animal! \\n\\n[setting: elaine\\'s office] \\n\\nelaine: i did not bare myself deliberately, but i tell you, i wish now that i had! (fred, shocked by her speech, flees. she calls after him, still standing at the hallway) because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! for i have seen the nipple on your soul! \\n\\ngx: so the minute i started up the steps to her apartment i knew i made a terrible mistake. going back with her. so we\\'re in her apartment she goes into the bathroom. i\\'m cursing myself; now how do i get out of this? then it hits me like a bolt of lightening. the pick. \\n\\njerry: the pick? \\n\\nelaine: the pick? \\n\\ngeorge: she comes out of the bathroom, i\\'m in up to my wrist. you should have seen the look on her face. \\n\\njerry: i think i\\'ve seen that look. \\n\\nkramer: i\\'ve got the magazine. the underwear ad came out. \\n\\njerry: boy, they really worked on your pectorals. \\n\\ngeorge: your buttocks are spectacular. \\n\\nelaine: oh my! \\n\\nkramer: what? \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m not sure but... i think i see your... \\n\\n% a night at the improv. jerry receives some disturbing news from the manager: the show has been delayed. \\n\\njerry: you don\\'t understand. i got this all timed out. i got another spot across town at 950, i\\'m not gonna be able to make it! \\n\\nkernis: i hear you, guy. \\n\\njerry: and i\\'m doin\\' letterman monday. you know, i gotta work out the material! \\n\\n% in the background is the plot complication of the week: buckles. the manager assures jerry that buckles isn\\'t on the menu. he just hangs around hoping that somebody drops out. \\n\\nkernis: why don\\'t you come back and do the 11 o\\'clock spot? \\n\\njerry: no, i\\'m supposed to meet my friends to see this movie ``checkmate\\'\\' at 1030. \\n\\nbuckles: hey, jer! \\n\\njerry: [not losing a step] heeeeyyyyyyyy..... [and out the door] \\n\\ngeorge: excuse me, do you have a ticket? \\n\\nman: no. \\n\\ngeorge: okay. good. \\n\\n% misunderstanding number one: when jerry shows up at the other comedy place, the manager tells him his spot was for 915, not 950. the manager had no choice but to give jerry\\'s spot to... \\n\\nbuckles: jerry! \\n\\njerry: what are <you> doing here? \\n\\nbuckles: hey, do you think this is funny? ``why do they call it athlete\\'s foot? you don\\'t have to be an athlete to get it. i mean, my father gets it all the time, and believe me, he\\'s no athlete!\\'\\' \\n\\nelaine: i\\'ve been *dying* to see ``checkmate\\'\\'. \\n\\ngeorge: well, if it\\'s as good as ``ponce de leon\\'\\', i\\'ll be happy. \\n\\nelaine: ``ponce de leon\\'\\', are you kidding me? i hated that movie! \\n\\ngeorge: ``ponce de leon\\'\\'? but that was great! \\n\\nelaine: oh, <come on>. that fountain of youth scene at the end, where they\\'re all splashin\\' around, and then they go running over to the mirror to see if it really worked? i mean, come on! [laughing too hard to continue] that\\'s stupid! \\n\\ngeorge: lemme tell you sum\\'in. when ponce looked in that mirror and saw that he hadn\\'t changed, and that tear started to roll down his cheek? ... i lost it. \\n\\n% apparently, a movie that can be interpreted on two levels. misunderstanding number two: kramer joins george and elaine after looking for them at the paradise twin around the corner. elaine hates the paradise because it\\'s a multiplex; she\\'d rather see a movie on a big screen. something catches kramer\\'s eye. \\n\\nkramer: listen, i\\'m gonna get a hot dog at payapa king. \\n\\ngeorge & elaine: no, wait! \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'re not going to get back here in time! \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m starvin\\', i haven\\'t had any dinner! \\n\\nelaine: you can get a hot dog in the theater. \\n\\nkramer: i don\\'t wanna get a movie hot dog! [in tears] i want a papaya king hot dog! \\n\\nelaine: kramer, jerry is going to be here any second, and then this line is going to start moving, and we\\'re going to end up in the front row. \\n\\nkramer: well, just save me a seat. \\n\\nelaine: no! i don\\'t want to save seats. don\\'t put me through that! i once had the fleece just ripped out of my winter coat in a seat-saving incident! \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m in line to buy. \\n\\nelaine: no, george, this is the ticket-<holders> line. \\n\\ngeorge: no it\\'s not, it\\'s the ticket-<buyers> line. \\n\\nelaine: then how come we\\'re not moving? \\n\\nkramer: good question. \\n\\ngeorge: is this the ticket holders line, or the buyers? \\n\\nman: holders. \\n\\ngeorge: but i asked you before if you had a ticket, and you said no! \\n\\nman: i didn\\'t. my friend was getting it. \\n\\ngeorge: [furious] good. it\\'s good to be accurate like that. \\n\\nelaine: can you believe him? \\n\\nkramer: he\\'s spaced out. \\n\\nelaine: how long would *you* have stood in the ticket-holders line? \\n\\nkramer: [thinks for a while] \\n\\nelaine: [gives up] yeah, exactly... \\n\\n% the movie has sold out. ``real good, george. real good.\\'\\' it\\'s now 10: 20, and kramer suggests they go watch the 1045 showing of \"checkmate\" at the paradise. elaine enters whine mode. \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t wanna go to a... miniplex multi-theater! \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s the same movie! what\\'s the difference? \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s not a theater, it\\'s like a room where they bring in pows to show them propaganda films. \\n\\njerry: [to taxi driver] take the park! \\n\\nbuckles: no no no, take 55th. \\n\\nbuckles: jerry, i want you to do me a favor. no more fish! \\n\\njerry: [rubbing his eyes hoping the nightmare will end] okay, i get your point! \\n\\nbuckles: i had a point? \\n\\ngeorge: hey, you know what else is playing here? ``rochelle rochelle\\'\\'. \\n\\nelaine: sigh/ugh. \\n\\ngeorge: i wouldn\\'t mind seein\\' <that>. \\n\\nelaine: yeah. you know, men can sit through the most boring movie if there\\'s even the slightest possibility that a woman will take her top off. \\n\\ngeorge: so what\\'s your point? \\n\\ngeorge: by the way, you owe me seven fifty. \\n\\nelaine: oh, all right. can you break a twenty? \\n\\ngeorge: no, i don\\'t have any change. \\n\\nelaine: oh, well, then i\\'ll pay you later. \\n\\ngeorge: or, i could take the twenty, then i could pay *you* later. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, you *could*... \\n\\ngeorge: might be easier. \\n\\nelaine: i mean, how is that easier? i mean, then you would owe me twelve fifty instead of me owing you seven fifty. \\n\\ngeorge: [trying to act as if he doesn\\'t care one way or the other, but we know better] either way. \\n\\nelaine: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: so... can i have it? \\n\\nelaine: i tell you what, i\\'ll get the popcorn and the soda. \\n\\ngeorge: whaddya mean, you\\'ll ``get\\'\\' the popcorn and the soda? \\n\\nelaine: i will buy your popcorn and soda. we\\'ll call it even. \\n\\ngeorge: i tell you what, you give me the twenty, and i will buy *you* a popcorn and soda, and i\\'ll throw in a bon-bons. \\n\\nelaine: [exasperated] george, you\\'re sappin\\' my strength. \\n\\ngeorge: you go in and save seats. \\n\\nelaine: [in a panic] me!? but that\\'s three seats! i can\\'t save three seats! i told you about that guy who tore up my winter coat! \\n\\nbuckles: jerry, i want you to have this piece of material. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s very nice of you, but i can\\'t do the voices. \\n\\nbuckles: jerry! don\\'t start up with me! \\n\\njerry: i gotta get out of this cab... \\n\\nbuckles: but jerry, quit riffing! \\n\\njerry: no, i\\'m not riffing. i\\'m ignoring! do you understand the difference? \\n\\nbuckles: [pause] can you help me get on the tonight show? \\n\\nelaine: no, these are saved. \\n\\nman: all of them? c\\'mon, you can\\'t take *four* seats. \\n\\nelaine: what, is that a rule? \\n\\ngeorge: well, why don\\'t *you* go, and i could save the seats. you said you didn\\'t like saving anyway. \\n\\nelaine: [stopping someone from sitting in the seat next to her] no, *taken*, taken, taken. [to george] [shrugs] i\\'m getting the hang of it. \\n\\ngeorge: why don\\'t you give me the twenty, and i\\'ll stop and get change, and then you and i can... uh... you-know, settle. \\n\\nelaine: can we do this later, george? \\n\\ngeorge: psh. what\\'s the point of even discussing it? [condescendingly takes her hand and pats it] you\\'ll give me the money when you have it. [takes two steps, then reconsiders, then re-reconsiders] i, i trust you. \\n\\nkramer: could you do me a favor? if you see a guy that\\'s five foot eleven, he\\'s got uh a big head and flared nostrils, tell him his friend\\'s going to be right back, okay? \\n\\nelaine: no, i\\'m sorry, these are taken. ... they\\'re in the lobby buying popcorn. ... what are you doing? these are taken, these are taken! \\n\\nwoman: which one? \\n\\nelaine: these two and this one. ... no! don\\'t come over here! these are taken. go! go! these are taken! they\\'re taken! they\\'re taken!!! \\n\\nelaine: oh, take \\'em. \\n\\ngeorge: um, excuse me, have you see a guy with like a horse face, big teeth, and a, and a pointed nose? \\n\\nclerk: ... flared nostrils? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. \\n\\nclerk: nope, haven\\'t seen him. \\n\\nbuckles: jerry, could you do me a personal favor? and if i\\'m out of line, *please*, let me know. could i keep my trench coat in your closet for a few months? \\n\\njerry: your trench coat in my closet? \\n\\nbuckles: jerry, my closet is packed to the gills, i\\'m afraid to open the door. just for a few months. it\\'ll make all the difference in the world. \\n\\nbuckles: we should see ``rochelle rochelle\\'\\'. i hear it\\'s really hot. \\n\\njerry: no thanks, maybe some other time. \\n\\nbuckles: really? do you really mean that? \\n\\njerry: no, i don\\'t. \\n\\nbuckles: you liked the athlete\\'s foot bit, right? \\n\\njerry: no. no. i was kidding. it\\'s terrible. \\n\\njerry: hi, i got some friends inside, i gotta get a message to \\'em. mind if i walk through real quick? \\n\\nusher: [indicates ``okay\\'\\'] \\n\\nkramer: hey, did that guy show up? \\n\\nclerk: the guy with the... horse face... and the big teeth... \\n\\nkramer: no, the guy with the big head and the flared nostrils. \\n\\nclerk: haven\\'t seen him. there was a short guy with glasses... looked like humpty-dumpty with a melon hat. but he left. \\n\\nwoman: so i got home, and he was vacuuming! i mean, he\\'s twelve years old! who else but my alan would do something like that? \\n\\nwoman: and then last night, he put on my high heels. oh, he put on such a show for us! he was dancing around, lip-sync\\'ing to ``a chorus line\\'\\', i mean you can see he\\'s got talent. \\n\\nelaine: [annoyed] excuse me, excuse me. \\n\\nwoman: what\\'s the problem? \\n\\nelaine: [momentarily shocked, as if the answer were self-evident] you\\'re talking. \\n\\nwoman: it\\'s the ``coming attractions\\'\\'. \\n\\nwoman: so anyway, he sings, he dances. and do you know what he\\'s gotten into now? he is cooking! he does a crepe... \\n\\nusher: ticket, sir? \\n\\ngeorge: uh, i just went out, i went to look for my friend? \\n\\nusher: do you have your stub? \\n\\ngeorge: [as if the word were totally foreign] my `stub\\'? \\n\\nusher: mm hm. \\n\\ngeorge: you don\\'t remember me? \\n\\nusher: it\\'s a big city, sir. \\n\\ngeorge: i went in with a pretty woman? you know, kinda short, big wall o\\' hair, face like a frying pan? \\n\\ngeorge: [whispering] elaine?

(elaine coughs.) plus you\\'re coming down with something? you want me to get sick? (offers gail the sandwich) bite? \\n\\ngail: so, how come? why did kramer do that? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know. once he leaves the building, he\\'s out of my jurisdiction. \\n\\ngail: well, tell him that i am mad at him. \\n\\njerry: alright. so, where ya cookin\\' now? \\n\\ngail: pfeiffer\\'s. \\n\\njerry: ah, the power lunch crowd. \\n\\ngail (to elaine): nice shoes! \\n\\nelaine: oh. thank you. \\n\\ngail: where\\'d you get \\'em? \\n\\nelaine (modest): they\\'re um, botticelli\\'s. \\n\\ngail (impressed): ooh, botticelli\\'s! look at you! i\\'m afraid to go in there. \\n\\nelaine: really. \\n\\njerry: would you care to join us? \\n\\ngail: no, no, i gotta get to the restaurant. (looks at her watch.) oh! see ya. (exits.) \\n\\njerry: see ya. \\n\\nelaine (irritated, imitates gail): \"oh, look at you, the botticelli\\'s.\" \\n\\njerry: that bothered you? \\n\\nelaine: yes, it bothered me. so i bought a pair of shoes at botticelli\\'s, i\\'m not allowed to shop there? that really embarrassed me. \\n\\njerry: it did? \\n\\nelaine: yes! couldn\\'t you see that? \\n\\njerry (thinks): no. this is why you\\'re not in the pilot. \\n\\ndana: well, george, i think you\\'re beginning to get some perspective on things. i think we\\'re making progress. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, i feel like i\\'ve grown. \\n\\ndana: good. so, let\\'s pick up on this next week. \\n\\ngeorge: great. (they both stand.) oh, by the way, did you get a chance to read the script? \\n\\ndana: yes, yes i did. \\n\\ngeorge (beaming): well, what\\'d you think? \\n\\ndana (unenthusiastic): uh...it was...good. \\n\\ngeorge: you didn\\'t like it? \\n\\ndana: well, no, i - \\n\\ngeorge: i can\\'t believe this! what was wrong with it? what didn\\'t you like about it? \\n\\ndana: it wasn\\'t funny. \\n\\ngeorge: it wasn\\'t funny? what, are you kidding? \\n\\ndana: no, i didn\\'t find it funny. \\n\\ngeorge: you didn\\'t find it funny?! this is what i\\'m paying for? \\n\\ndana: well, that whole storyline about a guy who gets into a car accident, doesn\\'t have any insurance, so the judge sentences him to be a butler? i didn\\'t really buy that. \\n\\ngeorge: let me tell you who did, uh, buy it...um we pitched this story to russell dalrymple, the president of nbc, and he ate it up with a spoon. \\n\\ndana: george, if you\\'re going to be in a creative field, you\\'re going to have to learn how to deal with criticism. \\n\\ngeorge: how\\'s this for criticism? um...you stink. how do like that criticism? you know what\\'s funny to me? that diploma up on the wall. that is my idea of \"com-med-dee\"! you sitting here, telling people what to do. \\n\\ndana: i think you\\'d better go. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, i\\'m goin\\' baby. i\\'m goin.\\' (heads for the door, then stops.) it\\'s jerry\\'s fault. he took out all my good lines. he\\'s such a control freak! \\n\\ngeorge (immediately, to elaine): so, you send me to this therapist to help me with my emotional disorders, and she criticizes our script. (tosses the script to jerry.) what kind of a therapist is that? \\n\\nelaine: i guess she didn\\'t think it was funny. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, she didn\\'t think it was funny. what is she, rowan & martin? we\\'re supposed to meet with nbc tomorrow! she completely shattered my confidence. and i\\'m paying for this, she\\'s my employee! \\n\\njerry: i thought your mother\\'s paying for it. \\n\\ngeorge: and she slaves to earn every penny. so that someday, i might be able to walk up to a woman and say, \"yes, i\\'m bald, but i\\'m still a good person.\" \\n\\njerry (to elaine): you know, he\\'s right. it\\'s not her place to criticize the script, which reminds me - what did you think of it? you never told me. \\n\\nelaine: what did i think of it? (manufactures a cough instead of answering. kramer enters.) \\n\\nkramer (to jerry): hey, buddy, i got something to tell ya. (elaine runs towards to the bathroom in lieu of answering jerry\\'s question.) \\n\\njerry (catches elaine): hey, one second, you don\\'t get off that easy. c\\'mon, tell me what you thought. \\n\\nelaine: well, you know, i... \\n\\nkramer: i just kissed gail cunningham. (jerry turns and looks at kramer, shocked. elaine grins and heads to the bathroom.) \\n\\njerry: you what? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, i kissed her. \\n\\njerry: you kissed her? \\n\\nkramer: right on the mouth. \\n\\njerry: what kinda great friend are you? how do you go from snubbing to kissing? \\n\\nkramer: well, i saw her outside the y, you know, she came up to me, she started yelling because i snubbed her, and then we started talking a little bit, and i walked her to her building. and just before i left, i put my arm around her waist, i pulled her to me, and i - mmm - i planted one! (laughs.) \\n\\njerry: and what did she do? \\n\\nkramer: she kissed me back. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t get this. i go out with this girl three times, she doesn\\'t want to shake my hand - why\\'s she kissing you? \\n\\nkramer (realizing): because i snubbed her. you see? women, they like that! yes! i understand women. the snub is good, they love the snub! \\n\\ngeorge: no they don\\'t. i tried that once. i snubbed for a year. nothing. every woman i saw, i snubbed. you never saw people so pleased. (elaine returns from the bathroom.) \\n\\nkramer (to elaine): ooh, so...i understand you\\'re buying your shoes now at botticelli\\'s. \\n\\nelaine: what? who told you that? \\n\\nkramer: gail cunningham. \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes? why are my shoes a topic of conversation? \\n\\nkramer: well, you know, we were just talking, and uh she mentioned how you\\'re buying your shoes now at botticelli\\'s. \\n\\nelaine (angrily): \"how i\\'m buying my shoes now at botticelli\\'s!\" did you hear this? (shoves jerry and kramer.) \\n\\njerry: so what? \\n\\nelaine: so what?! she is talking about my shoes! she is discussing my shoes! it is nobody\\'s business where i buy my shoes! (storms over to the couch and angrily sits down. jerry, kramer and george look at elaine from the kitchen, comically puzzled by her outburst...) \\n\\nelaine: hey! gail! \\n\\ngail: ya. (noticing it\\'s elaine) elaine...! \\n\\nelaine: why are you talking about my shoes? \\n\\ngail: what? \\n\\nelaine: my botticelli shoes. you\\'ve been talking about my botticelli shoes. \\n\\ngail: what are you talking about? \\n\\nelaine: did you or did you not tell kramer that i got my shoes at botticelli\\'s? (a waiter comes over and puts a plate of food on gail\\'s cutting board.) \\n\\nwaiter: too spicy. he wants another one. you got that pasta primavera? \\n\\ngail: look elaine, i am very busy here. \\n\\nelaine: who else have you mentioned my shoes to, huh? i wanna know why my footwear is your conversation! \\n\\ngail: i am not discussing this. this is insane. \\n\\nwaiter: you got that pasta primavera? let\\'s go! \\n\\ngail: ya ya ya, here. \\n\\nwaiter: here you are, mr. dalrymple. \\n\\nrussell: thank you. \\n\\nwaiter: sorry for the delay. enjoy your lunch. \\n\\nrussell (opening the door): well, come in. (they shake hands.) \\n\\njerry & george: hi. \\n\\nrussell: awfully sorry to make you come up here, but i really wasn\\'t feeling well enough to go back to the office, and well, it\\'s the only chance i have to meet with you this week. \\n\\njerry: are you alright? \\n\\nrussell: well, it\\'s my stomach. i think there must have been something in the pasta primavera i had for lunch. \\n\\njerry: oh, where did you eat? \\n\\nrussell: pfeiffer\\'s. \\n\\njerry: ah. i know the chef there. \\n\\nrussell: yeah. the food\\'s usually terrific. \\n\\ngeorge: my cousin worked for bouchard\\'s. they used to use the bouilla-base for a toilet. (jerry and russell are shocked.) \\n\\nrussell: what are you saying? \\n\\ngeorge: well, you didn\\'t hear it from me, but needless to say, if you go in there - stick with the consumee. \\n\\nrussell: well, we\\'d better get started, my daughter\\'s going to be here soon. \\n\\njerry: oh, you have a daughter? \\n\\nrussell: yeah, she just turned fifteen last week. \\n\\ngeorge: aw, that\\'s a fun age. (jerry looks at george distastefully.) \\n\\nrussell: alright. the script. now, i\\'ve read this thing three times...and everytime i read it...(looks nauseous, struggles not to vomit.) \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nrussell: excuse me for a second. (gets up and runs to the bathroom.) \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\ngeorge: would you like a pepto-bismol? i keep them in my wallet...! (russell goes into the bathroom and shuts the door.) (to jerry) do you think he liked it? (from the bathroom, we hear russell violently heaving his guts.) \\n\\njerry: i\\'m not sure. (the sounds of russell vomiting emanate from the bathroom. jerry and george sit there uncomfortably.) what was that dish he said he had...? \\n\\ngeorge: pasta primavera. \\n\\njerry: ah. you know, \\'primavera\\' is italian for \\'spring.\\' \\n\\ngeorge: no! \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\nrussell (coming out of the bathroom): really, i\\'m terribly sorry, it just, uh...all of a sudden it just hit me. \\n\\ngeorge: so, you were saying how, um...about the script... \\n\\nrussell: right. the script. your script needs some...it needs, um...(looks nauseous again. gets up and runs to the bathroom a second time.) \\n\\ngeorge: more jokes? \\n\\njerry: another ending? \\n\\ngeorge: a different name for the butler? (russell throws up again.) \\n\\njerry: maybe we should go. \\n\\ngeorge: we haven\\'t heard his notes yet, we don\\'t know how he feels about our work. (russell throws up yet again.) \\n\\nrussell (from bathroom): oh god. oh my god. \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t listen to anymore of this, the guy\\'s losing a lung in there. (russell\\'s daughter molly enters.) \\n\\nmolly: hello. \\n\\njerry: hi. \\n\\ngeorge: hi. \\n\\nmolly: i\\'m molly. \\n\\njerry: oh, i\\'m jerry. \\n\\ngeorge: george. \\n\\njerry: we\\'re here discussing our script with your father. \\n\\ngeorge: he just read it. (russell vomits again. jerry and george look ashamed.) \\n\\nmolly: daddy? are you okay? \\n\\nrussell (from bathroom): yeah, yeah sweetie. i\\'m fine. (molly sits on the back of the chair.) \\n\\ngeorge: so, you live with your mother, huh? \\n\\nmolly: uh, yeah. \\n\\ngeorge (to jerry): divorce is very difficult. especially on a kid. \\n\\njerry: uh huh. \\n\\ngeorge: of course, i\\'m the result of my parents having stayed together, so you never know. (russell comes out of the bathroom.) \\n\\nmolly: daddy, are you alright? what\\'s the matter? \\n\\nrussell: it\\'s just a stomach thing. \\n\\nmolly: yuck. \\n\\nrussell (to jerry and george): we\\'re going to have to do this some other time, so if you\\'ll give me your number, i\\'ll call you later. (jerry and george nod. molly takes her jacket off.) \\n\\ngeorge: you know, suddenly i\\'m in the mood for pasta primavera myself. (jerry nudges george to sneak a peek at molly\\'s cleavage as she bends over and looks in her backpack. jerry has a quick look, but george stares, hypnotized. russell comes up behind george.) \\n\\nrussell (angrily): get a good look, costanza? \\n\\njerry: what were you doing? \\n\\ngeorge: well, it\\'s not my fault. you poked me! \\n\\njerry: you\\'re supposed to just take a peek after a poke. you were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the empire state building. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s cleavage. i couldn\\'t look away. what am i, waiting to win an oscar here? this is all i have in my life. \\n\\njerry: looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don\\'t stare at it. it\\'s too risky. you get a sense of it and then you look away. \\n\\ngeorge: all right. so, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. who wouldn\\'t look at his daughter\\'s cleavage? she\\'s got nice cleavage. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s why i poked. \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s why i peeked. (jerry opens the door to take some trash out, and meets kramer and gail in the hallway.) \\n\\ngail: hey! what is with your friend elaine? \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\ngail: she comes to my restaurant, comes right in my kitchen, and starts complaining that i\\'m talking about her shoes. \\n\\njerry: she did? \\n\\nkramer: right in the kitchen. disgraceful. \\n\\ngail: so, i don\\'t want people coming into my kitchen. i think she might have sneezed all over someone\\'s pasta primavera. someone might have gotten sick because of her. (kramer and gail exit.) \\n\\ngeorge: pasta primavera? \\n\\njerry: is that what she said? (kramer pokes his head back in the door.) \\n\\nkramer (to jerry): she\\'s somethin\\', huh? she\\'s a wild one. she\\'s wearin\\' me out. \\n\\njerry: she is? \\n\\nkramer: she\\'s sensual. you know, with the...cooking and all. (kramer grins happily at jerry and leaves. the phone rings. jerry tosses the trashbag to george.) \\n\\njerry: hello? oh, hi stu. \\n\\ngeorge (lazily swinging the garbage bag around): from nbc? \\n\\njerry: (to george) yeah. (oh the phone) what\\'s goin\\' on? what? really? oh my god....did he give you a reason?...oh boy. okay. alright. thanks. (hangs up.) dalrymple just cancelled the pilot. (george drops the bag, shocked.) \\n\\njerry (to elaine): if you hadn\\'t gone into her restaurant, this never would have happened. \\n\\nelaine: look, i don\\'t like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay? my shoes are my business. the two of you shouldn\\'t have been looking at some fifteen year-old\\'s cleavage anyway! \\n\\ngeorge: he poked me! \\n\\njerry: there was cleavage in the area. that\\'s a reflex - (mimics nudging someone with an elbow) - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke... \\n\\nelaine: but she was fifteen. \\n\\njerry: you don\\'t consider age in the face of cleavage. this occurs on a molecular level, you can\\'t control it! we\\'re like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head. \\n\\ngeorge: alright, what\\'s the difference. what are we gonna do now? he won\\'t take our calls, we can\\'t get into his office... \\n\\njerry: you know what we could do? he eats at that restaurant, pfeiffer\\'s? we could have gail call us, tell us the next time he\\'s there, go there and talk to him. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, now you\\'re onto something. \\n\\njerry: the whole thing is so stupid. like he wouldn\\'t do the same thing if elaine walked by in a low-cut dress. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. well, maybe not elaine. \\n\\njerry: no. \\n\\ngeorge: but...somebody like gail, though. \\n\\njerry: ya. \\n\\nelaine: what? what do you mean, gail? (kramer enters.) \\n\\nkramer: yah-hey. \\n\\njerry: kramer, listen, i want you to ask gail to do me a favor. the next time russell dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call me. \\n\\nkramer: alright, i\\'ll call her right now. \\n\\njerry: ok. (kramer goes back to his apartment.) \\n\\nelaine (to george): what do you mean, gail? you don\\'t think i can attract attention? you don\\'t think i can put asses in the seats? \\n\\njerry: look, sweetheart, you know you\\'ve got it all. but let\\'s face it... (kramer comes back.) \\n\\nkramer: she said she\\'ll do it. \\n\\ngeorge: beautiful. \\n\\njerry: beautiful. \\n\\nkramer (points at elaine\\'s feet): but she wants the shoes. \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\nkramer: she says she wants those shoes. \\n\\nelaine: she wants my shoes? what kind of person is this? alright! she is not getting \\'em! \\n\\njerry: no, come on! i\\'ll buy you another pair! \\n\\nelaine: no, these were the last pair of these that they had! \\n\\njerry: i\\'ll get you another one just like it! \\n\\nelaine: no, but these were the only really cool ones like this! don\\'t you see how everybody likes \\'em and how everybody talks about \\'em? (jerry, realizing elaine\\'s motivation, sits at the counter unbelievingly.) \\n\\ngeorge (to elaine, in a somber tone): elaine, this pilot...it doesn\\'t matter to me, it\\'s not me i\\'m concerned about...it\\'s my mother. i\\'ve been over to the hospital to see her... \\n\\nelaine: oh yeah, because she caught you jer - \\n\\ngeorge: never mind! \\n\\nelaine: oh, come on, wait a second, this whole thing is ridiculous. how do i even know she wears the same size? \\n\\nkramer: alright, what size are you? \\n\\nelaine: seven-and-a-half. \\n\\nkramer: eh! bingo. \\n\\ngail (hands a plate to another chef): sauce this. (goes to the telephone and dials.) yeah, he\\'s here. oh, and one more thing...bring the shoes. (hangs up.) \\n\\njerry: hey! whattaya know! \\n\\ngeorge: look who\\'s here! \\n\\njerry: fancy meeting you here! \\n\\nrussell: oh. hello. \\n\\ngeorge (notices russell\\'s lunch): pasta primavera! back on the horse. \\n\\njerry: you know, it\\'s a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn\\'t heard from you. \\n\\ngeorge: didn\\'t hear anything... \\n\\njerry: didn\\'t know...we were wondering...what happened. \\n\\nrussell: well, it just didn\\'t seem to be the right project for us right now. (elaine walks by in a low-cut dress. jerry and george look at her as she moves to the table opposite russell.) so, what were you saying? \\n\\ngeorge: oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, i really have to take issue with that. i did not leer. (to jerry) did i leer? \\n\\njerry: no leer. (elaine comes over to russell\\'s table.) \\n\\nelaine (to russell): uh, excuse me, are you using that ketchup? \\n\\nrussell (not noticing elaine\\'s cleavage): uh, no. (elaine takes the ketchup and goes back to her table.) \\n\\ngeorge: because, if i\\'m looking straight ahead, and something enters my field of vision, that\\'s merely a happenstance. (elaine loudly snaps and unfolds her napkin at the next table to get russell\\'s attention.) \\n\\nrussell: under the circumstances, i don\\'t really feel that we should be in business together. (elaine comes back over.) \\n\\nelaine: here\\'s your ketchup back. you know, i had the hardest time trying to get some out. i mean, i just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. do you have any trouble? \\n\\nrussell (still not noticing elaine\\'s cleavage): no. \\n\\nelaine (leaning forward): do you have a...ketchup secret? \\n\\nrussell: no, i... (finally notices elaine)...don\\'t have a ketchup secret. (smiles.) \\n\\nelaine (flirtatiously): because if you do have a ketchup secret, i would really, really like to know what it is. (russell is pleased, and smiles at elaine. elaine goes back to her table, sits down, and waves at russell.) \\n\\nrussell (to jerry and george, reconsidering about the pilot): field of vision, huh? \\n\\ngail: how\\'s everything? \\n\\nelaine: mmmm. \\n\\njerry: really good. \\n\\ngeorge: this pasta primavera is fabulous. \\n\\njerry: very tasty. \\n\\ngail: how\\'d everything go with that nbc guy? \\n\\ngeorge: great. \\n\\njerry: the pilot\\'s back on. in fact, elaine\\'s going out with him tomorrow night. (gail nods and walks away.) listen, elaine, you know if russell mentions anything about the pilot, you\\'ll of course tell him how much you liked it...? \\n\\nelaine: you know, i happen to have the script right here with me and, uh...on page 3, for example, suppose the elaine character comes in wearing a...a low-cut dress. and the butler is very distracted, and can\\'t work. \\n\\njerry: uh...that kind of comedy, that\\'s a little broad for us. \\n\\nelaine: well, i\\'m sure it\\'s right up russell\\'s alley. \\n\\ngeorge: well, it\\'s a funny idea. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s funny! \\n\\ngeorge: c\\'mon, funny is funny. \\n\\njerry: funny is funny, we\\'re here to entertain, right? \\n\\nelaine: alright, well, maybe i\\'ll mention it to russell tomorrow night. \\n\\njerry: if you can. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. where\\'s he taking you, by the way? \\n\\nelaine: bouchard\\'s, on 53rd. (george starts choking on his wine, and attempts to tell elaine something.) \\n\\njerry: i think what he\\'s trying to say is, \"get the bouilla-base.\" (george nods \\'yes\\' and continues to choke.) \\n\\nallison: i don\\'t want to *live*! i don\\'t want to *live*! \\n\\ngeorge: because of me? you must be joking! who wouldn\\'t want to live because of me? i\\'m nothing! \\n\\nallison: no... you\\'re *something*. \\n\\ngeorge: you can do better than me. you could throw a dart out the window and hit someone better than me. i\\'m no good! \\n\\nallison: you\\'re good. you\\'re *good*! \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m bad. i\\'m *bad*! \\n\\nallison: you\\'re *killing* me! \\n\\ngeorge: so what could i do? i couldn\\'t go through with it. she threatened to kill herself. \\n\\nelaine: over you? \\n\\ngeorge: yes. why, is that so inconceivable? \\n\\ngeorge: i got two tickets to see \"guys and dolls\". \\n\\nelaine: i got him a two-line phone. \\n\\njerry: unbelievable! she\\'s not there. \\n\\ngeorge: what paper does she write for? \\n\\njerry: the works for the nyu school newspaper. she\\'s a grad student in journalism. never been to a comedy club. never even seen me, has no idea who i am. \\n\\nelaine: never even seen you? gotta kinda envy that... \\n\\njerry: y\\'know, you\\'ve been developing quite the acid-tongue lately... \\n\\nelaine: [proudly] really? \\n\\nelaine: hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader? \\n\\njerry: living or all time? \\n\\nelaine: all time. \\n\\njerry: well, if it\\'s all time, then there\\'s no contest. it begins and ends with brezhnev. \\n\\nelaine: i dunno. you ever get a good look at degaulle? \\n\\ngeorge: lyndon johnson was uglier than degaulle. \\n\\nelaine: i got news for you. golda meir could make \\'em all run up a tree. \\n\\nelaine: y\\'know, just because you two are homosexuals, so what? i mean you should just come out of the closet and be openly gay already. \\n\\ngeorge: so, whaddya say? you know you\\'ll always be the only man i\\'ll ever love. \\n\\njerry: [indignantly] what\\'s the matter with you? \\n\\ngeorge: [quietly] c\\'mon, go along... \\n\\njerry: i\\'m not goin\\' along. i can just see you in berlin in 1939 goose- stepping past me \"c\\'mon jerry, go along, go along...\" \\n\\njerry: y\\'know i hear that all the time. \\n\\nelaine: hear what? \\n\\njerry: that i\\'m gay. people think i\\'m gay. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too. \\n\\njerry: yeah, \\'cuz i\\'m single, i\\'m thin and i\\'m neat. \\n\\nelaine: and you get along well with women. \\n\\ngeorge: i guess that leaves me in the clear... \\n\\ngeorge: i just thought of a great name for myself, if i ever become a porno actor. \\n\\njerry: oh yeah, what? \"buck naked\"? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, how did you know that? \\n\\njerry: you told me that already like two months ago. \\n\\ngeorge: allison bought it for me. \\n\\njerry: how you gonna get out of *that* one? \\n\\ngeorge: i dunno. i guess i have to wait for her to die. \\n\\njerry: he\\'s gonna hang around if that\\'s alright with you? \\n\\nsharon: sure, i\\'d like to talk to him, too. \\n\\ngeorge: jerry did you wash this pear? \\n\\njerry: yeah, i washed it. \\n\\ngeorge: it looks like it hasn\\'t been washed. \\n\\njerry: so *wash* *it*. \\n\\ngeorge: you hear the way he talks to me? \\n\\nsharon: you should hear how *my* boyfriend talks to me... \\n\\ngeorge: let me ask you something. what do you think of this shirt? \\n\\nsharon: it\\'s nice. \\n\\ngeorge: jerry said he didn\\'t like it. \\n\\njerry: i didn\\'t say i didn\\'t like it. i said it was o.k... \\n\\ngeorge: no, you said you didn\\'t like it... \\n\\njerry: oh, so what if i don\\'t like it. is that like the end of the world, or something? \\n\\nsharon: so how did you two meet? \\n\\njerry: actually, we met in the gym locker room. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. actually it was in gym class. i was trying to climb the ropes and jerry was spotting me. i kept slipping and burning my thighs and then finally i slipped and fell on jerry\\'s head. we\\'ve been close ever since. \\n\\n(george takes a hold of jerry\\'s leg to stress the point and sharon, who obviously thinks she has a real story here now, asks another question: ) \\n\\nsharon: do you guys live together? \\n\\njerry: [quizzically] live together? \\n\\ngeorge: no, i got my own place. \\n\\n(jerry is about *this* close (picture my thumb and forefinger *really* close together) to figuring out what is going on here, when the \"question fatale\" is asked: ) \\n\\nsharon: and do your parents know?

[they kiss again] *alright*, i forgive you... \\n\\nsharon: y\\'know the funny thing is, i was attracted to you immediately. \\n\\njerry: i was attracted to you, too. you remind me of lois lane. \\n\\ngeorge: jerry! oh, my god! what are you doing!?! \\n\\njerry: what!? \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'re with a *woman*! \\n\\njerry: i know! what are you doin\\' here?!? \\n\\ngeorge: i leave you alone for two seconds, and this is what you do! i trusted you! \\n\\njerry: [forcibly removing g. from the apt] would you get the hell out of here! \\n\\nsharon: what\\'s going on? \\n\\nallison: yeah, what\\'s going on? \\n\\ngeorge: alright, tell her. go ahead. \\n\\njerry: tell her what? \\n\\ngeorge: y\\'know. about *us*. \\n\\ngeorge: alright, i\\'ll tell you the truth. i\\'m not gay. my name\\'s buck naked, i\\'m a porno actor. \\n\\nallison: *really*? \\n\\nkramer: we\\'ll see you later... \\n\\nkramer: he\\'s the *phone* man! \\n\\nkramer: not that there\\'s anything wrong with that... \\n\\ni am not gay. i am, however, thin, single and neat. sometimes when someone is thin, single and neat people assume they are gay because that is a stereotype. they normally don\\'t think of gay people as fat, sloppy and married. although i\\'m sure there are, i don\\'t want to perpetuate the stereotype. i\\'m sure they are the minority though within the gay community. they\\'re probably discriminated against because of that, people say to them \"y\\'know joe, i enjoy being gay with you but i think think it\\'s about time, y\\'know that you got in shape, tucked the shirt in and lost the wife\". but if people are even going to assume that people that are neat are gay, maybe instead of doin\\' this: \"y\\'know i think joe might be a little... [waves hand back and forth]\", they should vacuum \"y\\'know i think joe might be >vroom< [makes vacuuming motion]. yeah, i got a feeling he\\'s a little >vrooom<...\" \\n\\ngeorge: oh, what\\'s the point? when i like them, they don\\'t like me, when they like me, i don\\'t like them. why can\\'t i act with the ones i like the same way i do with the ones i don\\'t like? \\n\\njerry: well, you\\'ve only got another fifty years or so to go before it\\'ll *all* be over... \\n\\ngeorge: maybe i need someone who doesn\\'t speak english. \\n\\njerry: yeah, how about a mute? \\n\\ngeorge: a mute would be good. \\n\\njerry: ah, where you gonna meet a mute? \\n\\ngeorge: this is what my life has come to... tryin to meet a mute. \\n\\ngeorge: i dunno, jerry somethin\\'s missing. there\\'s a void, jerry, there\\'s a void... \\n\\njerry: a deep, yawning chasm... \\n\\ngeorge: there\\'s gotta be more to life than this. what gives you pleasure? \\n\\njerry: listening to you. i listen to this for fifteen minutes and i\\'m on top of the world. your misery is my pleasure. \\n\\nelaine: hey boys! \\n\\njerry: hey! how you doin\\'? \\n\\nelaine: good. okay, well, it\\'s all set. i start tomorrow. \\n\\ngeorge: start what? \\n\\nelaine: i signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens. \\n\\ngeorge: *really*. \\n\\nelaine: yeah. god, i can\\'t tell you how i feel! i mean, i feel *so* *good*! i *really* feel good. the strange thing is, i mean, i haven\\'t even met the woman yet. \\n\\ngeorge: volunteer work, huh? \\n\\njerry: what\\'re you gonna do down there? \\n\\nelaine: well, they say all it is is that you go over to their apartment and, i dunno, you take them for a walk and you get a cup of coffee and it\\'s supposed to make them feel good. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s what i do with him [points at george] \\n\\ngeorge: when did you get this idea? \\n\\nelaine: last time i had lunch with you here. you were going *on* and *on* and *on* about how you wanted to meet somebody who didn\\'t speak english. \\n\\njerry: what, do you break it in with her, then you try it out on me? \\n\\ngeorge: and... and anybody can do this? \\n\\nelaine: yup. \\n\\ngeorge: helping people... of course. of course! it makes perfect sense! how could i *not* be doing this!? i am gonna help somebody, dammit! \\n\\nelaine: [to jerry] what about you? \\n\\njerry: nah, it\\'s not for me. \\n\\nelaine: jerry, if anybody should be doing this, it\\'s you. \\n\\ngeorge: what *kind* of a person are you? \\n\\njerry: i think i\\'m pretty much like you-- only successful. \\n\\nagency rep: this is a wonderful thing you\\'re doing. they\\'re so grateful just to have someone to talk to. and i can tell you that everyone who participates finds the experience extremely rewarding. \\n\\ngeorge: well, i feel better already. i\\'m feelin\\' like a good person. \\n\\nagency rep: good luck. \\n\\njerry: thank you. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, what\\'s your guy\\'s name again? \\n\\njerry: fields. sidney fields. *87* years old. *87*. how about your guy? \\n\\ngeorge: ben cantwell. 85. huh... you think we\\'ll make it to that age? \\n\\njerry: *we*? no. \\n\\nkramer: so what\\'s up, diggity dog? \\n\\njerry: george and i just signed up with the senior citizen\\'s volunteer agency. same thing elaine\\'s doing. \\n\\nkramer: oh, that\\'s too bad. now don\\'t say i didn\\'t try to warn you. \\n\\njerry: what\\'re you talkin\\' about? \\n\\nkramer: oh, jerry, i\\'m *surprised* at you! \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s a *con*. these agencies are usually a front for some money laundering scheme. or they\\'re bunko artists; bilkin\\' people out of their life savings, oh *yeah*. \\n\\njerry: where do you *get* this? \\n\\nkramer: the alternative media, jerry. that\\'s where you hear the truth. \\n\\nnewman: kramer?! kramer!? where are you? kramer!?! kramer!!? \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m in here. c\\'mon... \\n\\njerry: hello, *newman*... \\n\\nnewman: jerry, george. [to kramer] so, did you ask him about the records? \\n\\nkramer: well-- \\n\\njerry: what records? \\n\\nkramer: well, newman and i are going partners selling used records. \\n\\nnewman: you know ron\\'s records down on bleeker? they pay big cash for used records! \\n\\nkramer: yeah, so we thought if you had any of those big, y\\'know, old-fashioned useless records, y\\'know, just... lyin\\' around-- \\n\\nkramer: y\\'know, we\\'d take them off your hands, free of charge. \\n\\ngeorge: let me ask you something. what do you do for a living, newman? \\n\\nnewman: i\\'m a united states postal worker. \\n\\ngeorge: aren\\'t those the guys that always go crazy and come back with a gun and shoot everybody? \\n\\nnewman: sometimes... \\n\\njerry: why *is* that? \\n\\nnewman: because the mail never stops. it just keeps coming and coming and coming, there\\'s never a let-up. it\\'s relentless. every day it piles up more and more and more! and you gotta get it out but the more you get it out the more it keeps coming in. and then the bar code reader breaks and it\\'s *publisher\\'s clearing house* day!!! \\n\\nron: i\\'ll give you five bucks. \\n\\nkramer: five bucks??? \\n\\nnewman: well, you know how much those records are worth!? \\n\\nron: yeah, i do... fi\\' dollars. \\n\\nnewman: those records are worth more than five dollars! \\n\\nkramer: [in newman\\'s ear] he\\'s gyppin\\' us... \\n\\nnewman: you\\'re gyppin\\' us! \\n\\nron: well, whattya got here, y\\'know, you got \"don ho live at honolulu\", you got \"jerry vale sings italian love songs\" you got sergio mendes, now come on... \\n\\nkramer: wait, wait, wait... sergio mendes has a cult following. \\n\\nnewman: they follow him like a cult. \\n\\nkramer: he can\\'t even walk down the street in south america... \\n\\nron: look, that\\'s his problem, alright? now you don\\'t like it, too bad. \\n\\nkramer: [in newman\\'s ear] i don\\'t like it... \\n\\nnewman: i don\\'t like it. \\n\\nron: well, then get the hell out of my store, alright? you bring me something decent, i\\'ll give you some money. \\n\\nkramer: [in newman\\'s ear] alright, well be back, jack. \\n\\nnewman: alright, well be back... *jack*! \\n\\njerry: hi, i\\'m jerry seinfeld, the agency sent me. \\n\\nhousekeeper: agency? \\n\\njerry: yeah, is this sid field\\'s residence? \\n\\nhousekeeper: sid fields. \\n\\nsid: what the *hell* is it? \\n\\njerry: mr. fields? \\n\\nsid: what!?! \\n\\njerry: hi, i\\'m jerry seinfeld, the agency sent me. \\n\\nsid: agency? what agency? the *cia*? \\n\\njerry: no, no, the-- \\n\\nsid: who let you in here? \\n\\njerry: the woman, she-- \\n\\nsid: oh *her*. she *steals* from me. steals my money. she says she doesn\\'t speak english. my *ass* she doesn\\'t speak english. plays that freakin\\' \"voo-doo\" music, tries to hypnotize me. she thinks she\\'s gonna turn me into a zombie and then rob me blind. well, i wasn\\'t born yesterday. i may drop dead today, but i sure as hell wasn\\'t born yesterday. now get the hell out of my house... \\n\\njerry: mr. fields, i\\'m here to spend some time with you. \\n\\nsid: oh, really. are you the boyfriend? i know she\\'s got a boyfriend. are you going to *kill* me? i\\'m an old man for crying out loud, you gonna kill an old man, you coward?!?

(a woman walks by jerry and elaine.) hi, how ya doin.\\' (jerry jerks a thumb at the woman to confirm his talent. elaine is skeptical.) \\n\\nelaine: oh, right. c\\'mon, don\\'t you think they seem a bit too perfect? \\n\\njerry: yes, they do! \\n\\nelaine: i never knew you were so into breasts. i thought you were a leg man. \\n\\njerry: a leg man? why would i be a leg man? i don\\'t need legs. i have legs. have you ever seen her naked in the locker room? \\n\\nelaine: no. \\n\\njerry: oh, well, then i can\\'t accept your testimony. maybe if you had seen her naked. \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t want to see her naked. \\n\\njerry: well, i do. \\n\\nelaine: well, that\\'s your problem. \\n\\njerry: look, you made the allegation. the least you could do is follow up. \\n\\nelaine: jerry, what am i gonna do? i\\'m gonna go in there and spy on her in the sauna? \\n\\njerry: yes! go in there! do a little investigative journalism. i need to know! \\n\\nelaine: but a few more dates and you can find out for yourself! \\n\\njerry: don\\'t be so sure. look at george - he\\'s on his ninth date with betsy, he still hasn\\'t gotten anywhere with her. \\n\\nelaine: what\\'s his problem? \\n\\njerry: well, every time he tries to make a move, something screws up. like on their last date, they were on the couch, but she was sitting on his wrong side. \\n\\nelaine: wrong side? \\n\\njerry: yeah, she was on his right side. he can\\'t make a move with his left hand. can\\'t go left. \\n\\nelaine: he can\\'t go left. \\n\\njerry: no! i\\'m lefty, can\\'t go right. what about women? do they go left or right? \\n\\nelaine: nah, we just play defense. \\n\\ngeorge: can i ask you a question? would you mind switching seats? \\n\\nbetsy: oh, actually, i really prefer to sit here. i don\\'t hear very well out of this ear (points to her right ear) so, i always try to sit to the right of people. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'ll shout. \\n\\nbetsy: well, i really think i feel more comfortable here. \\n\\ngeorge: c\\'mon, c\\'mon...(stands up and physically rolls betsy to the left side of the couch.) see, now, is that so bad? \\n\\nbetsy: what? (the phone rings.) \\n\\ngeorge (attempting to make a move): no, no, the machine\\'ll get it... \\n\\nbetsy: no, no, it\\'s not on... \\n\\ngeorge: they\\'ll call back. \\n\\nbetsy: but george, what if it\\'s an emergency? \\n\\ngeorge: in the whole world right now, there\\'s maybe three emergencies. why would you think, on this entire planet, that you\\'re one of those three? \\n\\nbetsy: george, please. (gets up and answers the phone.) hello? what? (shocked) oh my god! \\n\\ngeorge: alright, maybe four. \\n\\nelaine\\'s brain: boy, i\\'m really sweatin.\\' good sweat, beads of sweat...sweatin\\' bullets. (notices sidra.) look at her. i don\\'t need to see her naked to know those aren\\'t real. why does she need to tie the towel around her? she\\'s got a rack on her chest. (sidra takes her towel off and lies down.) oh god! sidra\\'s takin\\' the towel off! (looks at sidra\\'s chest.) whoa, doctor! that\\'s it, i knew it! i knew it, they\\'re definitely fake. \\n\\nbetsy: so, when\\'s the funeral? well, aunt clarice was so ill, i guess it was really a blessing. (george, on the couch behind betsy, is impatiently waiting for her to get off the phone so he can continue putting the moves on her. he shrugs, and crosses himself.) yeah, i\\'ll fly home as soon as i can. (george waves goodbye, and mimics a plane flying through the air with his hand.) o.k. you, too. get some sleep. (betsy looks at george, and he manufactures a completely phony look of sorrow.) \\n\\njerry: you\\'re sure? \\n\\nelaine: positive! this chick\\'s playin\\' with confederate money. \\n\\njerry: well then, that\\'s it. that\\'s the end of that. \\n\\nelaine: what? just \\'cause of that? \\n\\njerry: just \\'cause of that? it\\'s like finding out mickey mantle corked his bat! \\n\\nelaine: oh, come on! you\\'ve dated women with nosejobs, what\\'s the difference? \\n\\njerry: you don\\'t touch the nose! you don\\'t aspire to reach the nose. you don\\'t unhook anything to get to a nose, and no man has ever tried to look up a woman\\'s nostril. \\n\\nelaine: you\\'ve put a lot of thought into this, haven\\'t you? \\n\\njerry: well, i take it very seriously. \\n\\nelaine: you know, sometimes when i think you\\'re the shallowest man i\\'ve ever met, you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool. \\n\\nkramer: hey. \\n\\njerry: hey. you know, i do kinda wonder what fake breast feel like. \\n\\nkramer: well, i know what they feel like. \\n\\njerry: you? how do you know? \\n\\nkramer: well, i lived in los angeles for three months. \\n\\nelaine (laughs): i thought you hated los angeles. \\n\\nkramer: i do! i just miss the warm weather, y\\'know? jeez. oh man, i wish i could get away. \\n\\njerry: real busy now down at the office? \\n\\nkramer: no. huh? you know who i saw at the health club? salman rushdie. \\n\\nelaine (laughing): yeah right, salman rushdie. yeah well, i can see that - you got five millions moslems after you, you wanna stay in pretty good shape. \\n\\ngeorge: i know what the problem is - i like her too much. that\\'s why i can\\'t make a move. \\n\\njerry: you put her on a pedestal. \\n\\nkramer: i put them on a dental chair. \\n\\njerry: he puts \\'em on a dental chair. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m not her boyfriend. i want to be her boyfriend. \\n\\nkramer: whoo. it\\'s like a sauna in here. \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s funny. you\\'re a funny guy. \\n\\njerry: yeah, funny. yeah, i never heard that before. (to george) so, you goin\\' to the funeral? \\n\\ngeorge: why, you think i should? \\n\\njerry: what, are you kidding? it\\'s a golden opportunity to advance the relationship. she\\'s crying, you put your arm around her and console her...you\\'re the consolation guy! \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m the consolation guy...? \\n\\nkramer: consolation guy is big. \\n\\njerry: her aunt dying is the best thing that ever happened to you. \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s like ten dates in one shot. \\n\\njerry: this confers upon you instant boyfriend status. the family\\'s there...you\\'re taking care of things...you\\'re gettin\\' the sandwiches...you\\'re the rock! \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s in detroit though, it\\'s an expensive flight. \\n\\nkramer: why don\\'t you get a \"death in the family\" fare? \\n\\ngeorge: what? \\n\\nkramer: you go to the airlines, you tell them you got a death in the family? they give you 50% off the fare. \\n\\ngeorge: really? \\n\\nkramer: in fact, listen...i\\'ll go down there with ya. you know, we\\'ll tell them there\\'s a death in my family, you buy the ticket, i\\'ll split it...then i\\'ll get the bonus miles and you\\'ll get to detroit for a quarter of the price! \\n\\nelaine\\'s brain: boy, i\\'m gettin\\' a good sweat here. great sweat, good beads. nice beads. \\n\\nelaine\\'s brain: ah, look who\\'s here. \"silicon valley.\" \\n\\nsidra (to her friend): so anyway, we go out on one date, he asks me out for a second, then out of nowhere he cancels the date and says he doesn\\'t want to see me again. \\n\\nelaine: uh...sorry, i couldn\\'t help overhearing. \\n\\nsidra: oh, that\\'s o.k. \\n\\nelaine: did he give you a reason? \\n\\nsidra: yeah. he\\'s going back to his old girlfriend. \\n\\nelaine: really? \\n\\nsidra: he said she\\'s mentally ill. he\\'s one of those guys who is obsessed with neatness and order? everything has gotta be just so. he would have made a great nazi. \\n\\nelaine: hey, does he ever talk about superman? \\n\\nsidra: yes! how did you know? \\n\\nelaine: oh, i know the type. \\n\\nsidra: so you can relate? \\n\\nelaine: oh, yeah. \\n\\nsidra (sits across from elaine and takes her towel off): you know, i\\'ve seen you around the club. my name\\'s sidra. this is marcy. \\n\\nelaine: oh, hi. i\\'m elaine. (gets up to shake sidra\\'s hand, but stumbles and falls \"right into them.\") \\n\\nelaine: so anyway, i stood up to shake her hand, then suddenly i lost my balance and i fell right into her. \\n\\njerry: you fell on her? \\n\\nelaine: i touched \\'em. \\n\\njerry: you what? \\n\\nelaine: i...touched...\\'em. \\n\\njerry: you touched \\'em?! \\n\\nelaine: i needed them to help me break my fall! if it hadn\\'t been for them, i could have really injured myself! \\n\\njerry: wow. \\n\\nelaine: anyway...they\\'re real. \\n\\njerry: excuse me?! \\n\\nelaine: i think they might be real. \\n\\njerry: oh, what do you know, you have no breast touching experience. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'ve touched mine! \\n\\njerry: so have i. \\n\\nelaine: oh, right...i forgot. (smiles) \\n\\njerry: anyway, touching two breasts doesn\\'t make you an expert. \\n\\nelaine: alright, well anyway, i think they\\'re real. and if they are, i must say they are...spectacular. \\n\\njerry: aw, what are you doin\\' to me? (puts his head down on the counter.) \\n\\ngeorge (to clerk): you see, my friend here, his aunt passed away last night. \\n\\nclerk (to kramer): oh, i\\'m very sorry. \\n\\nkramer: i saw her last week, she looked healthy and peaceful, but...she knew... \\n\\nclerk: you poor thing! \\n\\nkramer (breaking into tears): i...i... \\n\\ngeorge: you don\\'t think you can buy the ticket yourself...? no, there, there...you sit, and i\\'ll purchase the ticket for you. \\n\\nclerk: you\\'re a good friend. \\n\\ngeorge: i understand you offer a 50%-off \\'bereavement\\' fare...? \\n\\nclerk: yes, all you have to do is pay the full fare now, then return to any one of our counters with a copy of the death certificate, and we\\'ll refund half your fare. \\n\\ngeorge: the death certificate? \\n\\nclerk: yes, yes, we do need documentation or you know, people could take advantage. \\n\\ngeorge: what kind of a sick person would do a thing like that? \\n\\nclerk: i know! but it happens. \\n\\ngeorge: you want my friend to ask his uncle, a man who just lost his wife of 44 years, for a death certificate so that he can save a few bucks on a flight? \\n\\nclerk: that would be $387 round-trip. \\n\\nkramer (in a perfectly normal tone of voice): alright, so you\\'ll need my frequent flyer number, huh? \\n\\nclerk: yes. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know, one minute you say they\\'re fake, the next minute you think they\\'re real...i don\\'t know what to believe! \\n\\nelaine: hey, of the two of us, i\\'m the only one who\\'s touched \\'em. \\n\\njerry: but you were just grabbing on to them to save your life. if you were drowning and i threw you a life preserver, you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable? \\n\\nelaine: i wouldn\\'t have said anything if i knew you were going to stop seeing her! \\n\\njerry: well, i don\\'t mind someone with a phony personality, but i gotta draw the line somewhere. \\n\\nkramer: hey! \\n\\njerry: hey. george off to detroit? \\n\\nkramer: yep! and, in two days, i\\'m off to puerto rico. \\n\\nelaine: hey kramer, by the way, i saw that guy at the health club...that is not salman rushdie. \\n\\nkramer: pffft - wrong. \\n\\njerry: there\\'s sidra. \\n\\nkramer: there\\'s salman. \\n\\njerry: where? \\n\\nkramer: talkin\\' to that woman. \\n\\njerry: talkin\\' to sidra? \\n\\nkramer: if that\\'s sidra, she\\'s talkin\\' to salman. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t think that\\'s salman. \\n\\nkramer: well, i don\\'t think they\\'re real. \\n\\njerry: if that\\'s rushdie, they\\'re real. \\n\\nkramer: if they\\'re real, that\\'s rushdie. \\n\\njerry: well, i gotta know - i\\'m talkin\\' to sidra. \\n\\nkramer: i gotta know, i\\'m talkin\\' to salman. \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s like a sauna in here, huh? i feel like i\\'m...back at the desert. \\n\\n\"salman\": you\\'ve lived in the desert? \\n\\nkramer: oh, yeah. yeah, i\\'ve uh...i\\'ve spent a little time in the mideast. you ever been to the mideast? \\n\\n\"salman\": yes, i\\'ve been there. \\n\\nkramer: my name\\'s kramer. \\n\\n\"salman\" (shakes kramer\\'s hand): sal bass. pleased to meet you, kramer. \\n\\nkramer: so, uh...what kind of work do you do? \\n\\n\"salman\": i\\'m a writer. \\n\\nbetsy (to aunt may): have you met my boyfriend george? \\n\\naunt may: no! (shakes george\\'s hand.) \\n\\nbetsy: george, this is aunt may, and father jessup. oh, and that\\'s my brother, timmy. (timmy smiles thinly.) this is my boyfriend, george. \\n\\naunt may: oh george, how nice of you to come all this way. \\n\\ngeorge: well, i\\'m the boyfriend. otherwise, what\\'s the point of being the boyfriend? this is where you have to be when you\\'re the boyfriend. \\n\\naunt may: betsy, dear, have you had anything to eat? \\n\\nbetsy: i\\'m not very hungry. \\n\\naunt may: they have some very nice snacks. \\n\\nfather jessup: i\\'m about to get myself a snack. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, no, no, no...you sit right here...i will get you a nice snack. \\n\\nfather jessup: this is my third wake this month. it never gets any easier. \\n\\ngeorge (loading up his plate with sandwiches): well, losing a loved is, uh...i mean, forget about it. (starts wolfing down the sandwiches.) \\n\\nfather jessup: you seem to be of great comfort to betsy, we\\'re very appreciative. \\n\\ngeorge: oh - comfort, schmomfort. listen, father, can i ask you a question? in a terrible time like this...who would i get the death certificate from? \\n\\nkramer: c\\'mon jerry! \\n\\njerry: oh, how can you be so sure? \\n\\nkramer: jerry, are you blind? he\\'s a writer. he said his name was sal bass. bass, jerry! instead of salmon, he went with bass! he just substituted one fish for another! \\n\\njerry: look, you idiot, first of all, it\\'s salman, not salmon! \\n\\nkramer: jerry, jerry, you\\'re missing the big picture! \\n\\njerry: alright, maybe it is, but listen, i gotta get ready - sidra\\'s coming over in a few minutes, so if you don\\'t mind... \\n\\nkramer: what, did you ask her? \\n\\njerry: i\\'m gonna find out tonight. \\n\\nkramer (nods): oh, yes indeed... \\n\\ndr. allenwood: why do you need a death certificate? \\n\\ngeorge: well, dr, allenwood, uh...i was hoping to compile an - admittedly, rudimentary - scrapbook of her life. something that betsy could have, and hold onto. \\n\\ndr. allenwood: well, i suppose i could make a copy of it. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, that would be wonderful. \\n\\ndr. allenwood: it was very nice meeting you, george. \\n\\ngeorge: likewise. \\n\\ntimmy: what are you doing? \\n\\ngeorge: what? \\n\\ntimmy: did...did you just double-dip that chip? \\n\\ngeorge: excuse me? \\n\\ntimmy: you double-dipped the chip! \\n\\ngeorge: \"double-dipped\"? what are you talking about? \\n\\ntimmy: you dipped the chip. you took a bite. (points at the dip) and you dipped again. \\n\\ngeorge: so...? \\n\\ntimmy: that\\'s like putting your whole mouth right in the dip! from now on, when you take a chip - just take one dip and end it! \\n\\ngeorge: well, i\\'m sorry, timmy...but i don\\'t dip that way. (takes a chip.) \\n\\ntimmy: oh, you don\\'t, huh? \\n\\ngeorge: no. (dips the chip) you dip the way you want to dip...(bites the chip) i\\'ll dip the way i want to dip. (dips the chip again.) \\n\\ntimmy: gimme the chip! (grabs george and the chip goes flying.) gimme the chip! (they struggle in front of the snack table.) \\n\\nsidra: i don\\'t know what i\\'m doing here, i must be crazy. (moves to the couch and sits on the left side. jerry tries to run over and beat her to it, but doesn\\'t make it. he sits down on the right side.) \\n\\njerry: hey, would you mind switching seats? \\n\\nsidra: why? \\n\\njerry: oh, i don\\'t know...i just like sitting to the left of people, makes me feel like i\\'m driving. \\n\\nsidra: o.k....(they switch places.) \\n\\njerry: how ya doin\\'? \\n\\nsidra: good. how you doin\\'? \\n\\njerry: good, feel good...you know that jayne mansfield had some big breasts. really big, huge...just coming out the top of her dress, they were like, chokin\\' her. \\n\\nsidra: i hear that\\'s how she died. \\n\\njerry: have you noticed that women today are, you know, they seem...bigger. \\n\\nsidra: well, a lot of women are having them done. \\n\\njerry: really? \\n\\nsidra: yeah. \\n\\njerry: how do you like that. \\n\\nsidra: a lot of people ask me if i\\'ve had mine done. \\n\\njerry: aw, you know people. \\n\\nsidra: it gets a little tiring, it\\'s really none of their business. \\n\\njerry: oh, the nerve. you know, some people have asked me if you\\'ve uh, done that. \\n\\nsidra: what do you tell them? \\n\\njerry: whatever you want me to tell them. \\n\\nsidra: well, i think you\\'ll find out soon enough. (they prepare to kiss. there\\'s a loud bang on the door.) aren\\'t you going to get that? \\n\\njerry: no. \\n\\nsidra: what if it\\'s an emergency? \\n\\njerry: oh, there\\'s no emergency... \\n\\nkramer (in hallway): jerry! c\\'mon, it\\'s an emergency! \\n\\njerry: excuse me. (gets up and answers the door.) alright, what is it? you\\'re interrupting! \\n\\nkramer: well, you know, i\\'m packing for puerto rico, i need to borrow your bathing suit. \\n\\njerry: this is an emergency? you need a bathing suit? \\n\\nkramer: well, i like yours. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know, my bathing suit? that\\'s a little familiar, i don\\'t want your...your boys down there. \\n\\nkramer: c\\'mon, what\\'s wrong with my boys? \\n\\njerry: your boys should stay in their neighborhood. \\n\\nkramer: alright, c\\'mon! \\n\\njerry: alright. it\\'s in the top drawer. hurry up. (kramer goes to get the suit. elaine enters.) \\n\\nelaine: hi, jer. \\n\\njerry: oh, hi, elaine. \\n\\nelaine: oh...hi, sidra - \\n\\nsidra: hi...elaine? (kramer comes back into the living room.) \\n\\njerry (to elaine): what are you doing here? \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m looking for kramer. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, she was just showing me pictures of places i can visit when i go to puerto rico...you know, when you two went down there? \\n\\njerry: oh. yeah. alright.

(leaves, then opens the door again.) and by the way...they\\'re real, and they\\'re spectacular. (sidra leaves.) \\n\\nbetsy: stop it, george! get out! get out! i never want to see you again! \\n\\ndr. allenwood: go back to new york! get out! \\n\\nclerk 2: alright sir, now all i need is a death certificate and you\\'ll be on your way. \\n\\ngeorge: well, you see, what happened was...the doctor - the very same doctor that was attending to my late aunt - suffered an untimely stroke, and lost the use of his right hand, so...obviously i was unable to get the death certificate. however, i do have this. (reaches inside his coat and takes out a polaroid photo.) \\n\\nclerk 2: what\\'s this? \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s a picture of me next to the coffin. \\n\\nclerk 2: nice try. \\n\\ngeorge: not even close, huh? \\n\\njerry: you can\\'t just *have* an adultery-- you *commit* adultery. and you can\\'t even *commit* adultery unless you already *have* a commitment. so you have to make the commitment before you can even think about committing it. there\\'s no commit without the commit. then, once you commit, then you can commit the adultery. then you can get caught, get divorced, lose your mind and they have you committed. but y\\'know some people actually *cheat* on the people that they\\'re cheating with. which is like, y\\'know, being in a hold up and then turning to the robber next to you and goin\\' alright, gimme everything you have, too\\'\\'. \\n\\ngeorge: you met her at the supermarket? how did you do that? \\n\\njerry: (flips a roll of paper towels in the air) produce section. *very* provocative area. a lot of melons and shapes. everyone\\'s squeezing and smelling... it just happened. \\n\\ngeorge: (laughs-hu) so when\\'re you gonna see her? \\n\\njerry: tonight. \\n\\ngeorge: what\\'s her name? \\n\\njerry: i... don\\'t... know... \\n\\ngeorge: how could you not know her name? \\n\\njerry: i was a little nervous, i got distracted. it has something to do with a car, or a fish... \\n\\njerry: look at that. why do i get bananas? they\\'re good for *one* day... \\n\\ngeorge: oh my god, i forgot to tell you. i got a letter today from the state controller\\'s office. y\\'know when i was going to public school back in brooklyn, every week i used to put fifty cents in the lincoln savings bank. \\n\\njerry: yeah, i did that too. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, you remember the, the little eh, bank book, there? \\n\\njerry: sure. \\n\\ngeorge: alright, so i haven\\'t put anything in it since sixth grade, i completely forgot about it. the state controller\\'s office tracks me down. the interest has accumulated to 1,900 dollars. 1,900 dollars! they\\'re sending me a cheque! \\n\\njerry: wow! \\n\\ngeorge: hu-yeah, interest. it\\'s an amazing thing. you make money without doing anything... \\n\\njerry: y\\'know i have some friends who try and base their whole life on that principle. \\n\\ngeorge: really? who? \\n\\njerry: nobody you know... \\n\\ngeorge: maybe i\\'ll go down to the track. put it all on a horse... \\n\\njerry: why don\\'t you put it in the *bank*? \\n\\ngeorge: the *bank*? this is *found* money. i want to *parlay* it. i wanna make a big score! \\n\\njerry: *oh*, you mean you wanna *lose* it... \\n\\nkramer: yeah... all right....ya got it, eh. \\n\\njerry: yes i did. \\n\\nkramer: yes. \\n\\ngeorge: what\\'s with the gloves? \\n\\nkramer: well, i\\'m staining my floors, y\\'know, i don\\'t want to get my hands dirty... \\n\\ngeorge: huh. what, the whole apartment? \\n\\nkramer: the whole apartment. and i\\'m buying that fake wood wallpaper. i\\'m gonna surround myself in wood. it\\'s gonna be like a log cabin. \\'cuz i *need* wood around me. wood, jerry [snaps fingers]... wood. \\n\\njerry: wood is good. \\n\\nkramer: definitely. \\n\\njerry: so we\\'re still going to the health club to play racquetball right? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, yeah, whenever you\\'re ready. \\n\\njerry: o.k., soon as elaine gets here. \\n\\nkramer: yep. \\n\\njerry: what, you rented \"home alone\"? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. \\n\\njerry: i thought you saw that already... \\n\\ngeorge: no, i saw \"home alone ii\". \\n\\njerry: oh, right... but you *hated* it! \\n\\ngeorge: well i was lost, i never saw the first one. by the way, you mind if i watch it here? \\n\\njerry: what for? \\n\\ngeorge: because if i watch it at my apartment i feel like i\\'m not doing anything. if i watch it here, i\\'m out of the house; i\\'m doing something. \\n\\njerry: all right.. go ahead. \\n\\njerry: yeah? \\n\\nelaine: (on the intercom) it\\'s me, are you ready to go? \\n\\njerry: no. come on up. \\n\\nkramer: i can\\'t work with these! \\n\\njerry: what\\'s wrong? \\n\\nkramer: well, you bought me dishwashing gloves. there\\'s no *fine touch*... \\n\\njerry: you said \"gloves\"... \\n\\nkramer: no, no, these are too thick. (removes the gloves/tosses them on the kitchen counter) \\n\\nkramer: oooh, is that \"home alone\"? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. the *original*. \\n\\nelaine: hey boys-o! \\n\\neveryone: (in unison) heyyyyyyyy. \\n\\nkramer: hey, how\\'s it goin\\'? \\n\\nelaine: hello. \\n\\njerry: (to kramer) hey (snaps fingers) get your stuff, let\\'s get going. \\n\\nelaine: well wait a minute, there\\'s a slight change of plans. \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nelaine: eh, remember roy, the artist? \\n\\njerry: oh, the \"triangle\" guy. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, exactly, the \"triangle\" guy. \\n\\njerry: yeah, you liked him. what happened with him? \\n\\nelaine: yeah i did. he was very talented. he was, ah just, i don\\'t know a little too... \\n\\njerry: artsy? \\n\\nelaine: fat. \\n\\njerry: oh. (unh - very quiet sigh) \\n\\nelaine: he was a fat, starving artist, y\\'know. that\\'s very rare. \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\nelaine: anyway, he\\'s in the hospital, he\\'s having surgery and i feel like should go visit him. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s wrong with him? \\n\\nelaine: unh, something with his spleen. anyway it\\'ll just take five minutes, o.k., and then, the hospital is right on the way. \\n\\nkramer: yeah. (putting hand to his mouth, hatching a thought) \\n\\njerry: all right we\\'ll wait for you. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, maybe i can get some rubber gloves there huh, yea. \\n\\nelaine: listen, jerry can you do me a favor? (clears throat) could you, go into the room with me to visit him because ah, i don\\'t want him to think that i\\'m, y\\'know... interested. \\n\\njerry: oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend. \\n\\nelaine: well... \\n\\njerry: well i think i can do that. i believe i\\'ve played that role before to some critical acclaim. \\n\\nelaine: aha ha ha (laugh) \\n\\nkramer: all right, lets go. \\n\\njerry: all right (picks up his sports bag) \\n\\nkramer: yep yep yep. \\n\\nelaine: what\\'s with him? \\n\\njerry: y\\'know a lot of people have asked that... \\n\\nelaine: roy! \\n\\nroy: *elaine*! what a *surprise*. (sitting up) \\n\\nelaine: (gasp) oh, my *god*! i hardly recognize you! you look so... \\n\\nroy: yeah, ya know, i\\'ve lost some weight... \\n\\nelaine: a *lot* of weight.

(about the yo-yo) \\n\\nelaine: now listen roy, tell me something. when, are you gettin\\' out of here? \\n\\nroy: next thursday. \\n\\nelaine: okay, i\\'ll tell you what. how about on friday i take you out for a *big* meal because *you* are getting *too* thin... \\n\\njerry: honey... aren\\'t we going to the poconos next friday? \\n\\nelaine: no that\\'s the week after. \\n\\njerry: no, i believe it\\'s next week. \\n\\nelaine: you\\'re wrong. \\n\\njerry: no i\\'m not... \\n\\nelaine: shut up... \\n\\nkramer: pay dirt!

(turns and walks away, makes a face, raises his eyebrows, nodding his head, then turns back to the group.) \\n\\ndoctor: tell you what. you\\'re obviously concerned about your friend\\'s welfare. a few of my students will be observing tomorrow\\'s operation from the viewing gallery. how would you like to watch it with them? \\n\\nkramer: i\\'d love to watch the operation, yeah! \\n\\njerry: i dunno... \\n\\nkramer: oh, come on jerry. you gotta see the operation. they\\'re gonna cut him open -- his guts\\'ll be all over the place... \\n\\njerry: yeah, that\\'s true... \\n\\nkramer: ...they\\'ll saw through bone. uuuuuuuing yutyutyutyutn naannnaaa [makes saw noises while gesturing over roy\\'s chest] you\\'ll see what\\'s *inside* bone... \\n\\ngeorge: ttu (wipes nose and sniffs) ttu. \\n\\njerry: hey. \\n\\ngeorge: hi... \\n\\njerry: what are doing, you crying?? \\n\\ngeorge: no...

(sips coffee) \\n\\ngeorge: alright, well you know what\\'cha gotta do, you gotta go through her purse. y\\'know, the-the credit cards, driver\\'s license... \\n\\njerry: how am i gonna do that? \\n\\ngeorge: when she goes to the bathroom. \\n\\nkramer: ah, (smacks hands) there you are. my date stood me up. listen, will you guys go to the operation with me? \\n\\njerry: you asked a date to go to the operation? \\n\\nkramer: yeah... so c\\'mon, (smacks hands and rubs them together) what d\\'you say? \\n\\ngeorge: what kind of operation is it? \\n\\nkramer: spleenectomy. \\n\\ngeorge: isn\\'t that where they remove the-- \\n\\nkramer: no no, don\\'t ruin it for me, i haven\\'t seen it yet! ah-c\\'mon, what d\\'you say? \\n\\ngeorge: mulva! (again pointing finger at jerry -- kramer watches the exchange back and forth) \\n\\njerry: mulva? (waves off george with his hand) \\n\\nkramer: c\\'mon, c\\'mon. you wanna go? (pats jerry a couple times on the shoulder quietly) c\\'mon. yeah, yeah, yeah. \\n\\njerry: alright, alright. just let me finish my coffee... then we\\'ll watch \\'em go slice this fat bastard up.

(pours a glass of milk) \\n\\nelaine: mmm... (elaine goes to the bathroom) \\n\\ngeorge: y\\'know if the guy dies, the art could really be worth something... \\n\\njerry: we gotta confess. \\n\\nkramer: really? \\n\\njerry: yes! \\n\\nkramer: we could be tried for murder... \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t have this on my conscience. we\\'re like leopold and loeb! ** \\n\\n(** footnote: see short bio at end of script **) \\n\\nkramer: you\\'re not gonna say anything, you got that? \\n\\njerry: i\\'m telling and you can\\'t stop me! \\n\\nkramer: you\\'re *not*!!! \\n\\ngeorge: hey elaine? put me down for some of that art. 1,900 dollars worth. \\n\\njerry: oh yeah, that\\'s the spot... \\n\\nwoman: what\\'re you so tense about? \\n\\njerry: oh, nothing really, just a homicide. [she finds the right spot on his back] oh that\\'s terrific... mulva. \\n\\nwoman: what? \\n\\njerry: mulva? \\n\\nwoman: mulva? \\n\\njerry: oh my eh, my aunt\\'s name is mulva. she\\'s-she\\'s a masseuse. \\n\\nwoman: huh. \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\nwoman: um, i\\'m going to the bathroom. i\\'ll be right back. \\n\\njerry: oh, good idea... \\n\\nwoman: what are you doing? \\n\\njerry: oh, i was just looking for er, some... gum or... mint. \\n\\nwoman: oh, i have junior mints. \\n\\njerry: no! [throws her purse back at her] no, i mean, no thank you, nah... \\n\\nkramer: any news? \\n\\njerry: [whispering] no, no news. you better get out of here. \\n\\nkramer: oh. \\n\\njerry: oh no, wait a second... wait a second... i-i don\\'t know the name of this woman in the bathroom, so when she comes out, you introduce yourself and then she\\'ll be forced to say her name. \\n\\nkramer: 10-4. \\n\\njerry: o.k. (closes the apartment door) \\n\\nwoman: oh, hello. \\n\\nkramer: hello, i\\'m kramer. \\n\\nwoman: nice to meet you. \\n\\nkramer: see you later. (he promptly turns and leaves) \\n\\nwoman: well, i better get going. i don\\'t want to be late for the play. (grabs her coat.) \\n\\njerry: oh, okay. \\n\\nwoman: y\\'know my cousin knows the producer. i may get to go backstage and meet olympia dukakis. \\n\\njerry: oh, hey, there\\'s a name you don\\'t forget. \\n\\nwoman: mm. bye jerry. \\n\\njerry: bye. \\n\\nwoman: oh, hi. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, hi, i\\'m george. (they shake hands) \\n\\nwoman: oh, nice to meet you, george. \\n\\ngeorge: yeahaha, i gave it a shot (pats jerry on the arm)... so, any word on the \"artiste\"? (puts a video in the vcr) \\n\\njerry: no, i haven\\'t heard anything. \\n\\ngeorge: hehe. well, i got my triangles. (sitting on the couch) \\n\\njerry: really... \\n\\ngeorge: yup, y\\'know, they really spruce up the apartment. \\n\\njerry: yeah, i\\'m sure... \\n\\njerry: well, i-i gotta call the hospital. i gotta tell \\'em what happened. \\n\\ngeorge: no-no jerry. i wouldn\\'t do that. \\n\\njerry: why? \\n\\ngeorge: ehh, you could get in trouble. \\n\\njerry: look, i gotta try and help the guy. \\n\\ngeorge: who are you to play god!? every man\\'s time comes! if his number is up, who are you to interfere!? \\n\\njerry: yes i\\'d like to speak with dr. siegel... it\\'s about roy kordic\\'s condition... \\n\\ngeorge: w-what? what? \\n\\njerry: oh, that\\'s *fantastic*! \\n\\ngeorge: he didn\\'t get better, did he? \\n\\njerry: thank you very much. o.k. bye-bye. he\\'s gonna be okay! \\n\\ngeorge: where\\'s the luck? there\\'s no luck. 1,900 dollars down the drain. \\n\\nroy: you saved my life, george. you buying my art is what inspired me to get better. i\\'ll never forget what\\'cha did for me. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, well th-that\\'s great. it\\'s really great. hm hm mm. \\n\\nkramer: y\\'know, art\\'s a great investment. \\n\\nelaine: and they\\'re gonna look great in your apartment, george. \\n\\ngeorge: yes i look forward to many years of... looking at the triangles. well, i\\'ll ah, i\\'ll wait for you outside. \\n\\nroy: hey, george... \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. \\n\\nkramer: awe, alright \\n\\njerry: that\\'s nice. \\n\\ngeorge: thanks roy. \\n\\nroy: heeyy - there\\'s the guy who saved my life. (points at the doctor.) \\n\\ndoctor: y\\'know... i don\\'t want to totally discount the emotional element in your recovery but, i think there were other factors at play here. \\n\\njerry: what do you mean? \\n\\ndoctor: i have no medical evidence to back me up but, something happened during the operation that staved off that infection. something beyond science. something perhaps, from above... \\n\\nkramer: mint? \\n\\ndoctor: those can be very refreshing. \\n\\nroy: so elaine... where are we going for our big dinner on friday? (takes a big mouthful of spaghetti) \\n\\nelaine: uh-m, uh i\\'m so sorry roy, but actually, we are going to the, poconos on friday, right honey? (pointing to jerrythe boyfriend?) \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t think so... \\n\\nelaine: we are... that means that we ah, we are... \\n\\njerry: i believe we\\'re not... \\n\\nelaine: (catching another glimpse of roy eating) hunh, please can we go to the poconos? \\n\\njerry: well, i\\'ll think about it... \\n\\nwoman: great seats. you could see the actors spitting. \\n\\njerry: really... \\n\\nwoman: uh-huh. and afterwards we went backstage and olympia dukakis autographed my playbill. \\n\\njerry: oh, wait a second, you got her autograph? \\n\\nwoman: yeah. \\n\\njerry: do you have it with you? \\n\\nwoman: yeah, it\\'s in my purse. \\n\\njerry: ah, le\\'me see. (hands jerry the playbill) \\n\\nwoman: y\\'know i really think i\\'m falling for you, jerry seinfeld. (stands up, a quick kiss on the cheek and hugs him.) \\n\\nwoman: oh, well, i really think i\\'m falling for you... [opens the playbill and flips five pages till he finds and reads autograph] .....joseph puglia... \\n\\nwoman: i had it autographed for my uncle. \\n\\njerry: yeah, i-i know... \\n\\nwoman: (licks he lips) you don\\'t know my name, do you? \\n\\njerry: yes i do. \\n\\nwoman: what is it? \\n\\njerry: it-it rhymes with a female body part. \\n\\nwoman: what is it? \\n\\njerry: mulva... \\n\\njerry: aub, ah, gipple? \\n\\njerry: loleola? \\n\\njerry: oh! oh! *delores*! \\n\\njerry: ages zero through ten, candy is your life. there\\'s nothing else. family, friends, school-- they\\'re only obstacles in the way of getting more candy. and you have your favorite candies that you love. you know the ones i love those... i hate those...\\'\\'. ``i hate those... i love those...\\'\\'. and only a seven year old kid could actually taste the difference between like a red m&m and a light brown, m&m. that\\'s two totally different things when you\\'re seven years old. \"well, your red is more of a main course m&m, but the brown it\\'s more of a mellower flavor; it\\'s an after dinner m&m, really\\'\\'. \\n\\njerry: ...and it *is* embarrassing, because a doggie bag means either you are out at a restaurant when you aren\\'t hungry, or you\\'ve chosen the stupidest possible way to get dog food that there is. how about the doggie bag on a date? that\\'s a good move for a guy, huh? lemme tell you something if you\\'re a guy and you ask for the doggie bag on a date, you might as well have them just wrap up your genitals too. you\\'re not going to be needing those for awhile, either. \\n\\njerry: is that bothering you? \\n\\nelaine: no, not at all... \\n\\nelaine: oh, could you please hurry? \\n\\njerry: [mockingly] \"please hurry\". look at you. look at what you\\'ve become. \\n\\nelaine: what? what have i become? i haven\\'t \"become\" anything... \\n\\njerry: oh, *carl* can\\'t wait a few more minutes? \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t want to keep him waiting... \\n\\njerry: he\\'ll like you more... \\n\\nelaine: that\\'s impossible... \\n\\nwife: andrew, why do you have to pick your teeth at the table? \\n\\nhusband: leave me alone. \\n\\njerry: yeah, i\\'m wanting to get married *real* soon... \\n\\njerry: so, where am i dropping you? \\n\\nelaine: his place... \\n\\njerry: this guy\\'s got quite a racket. i take you to dinner and then drop you off at his apartment... \\n\\nelaine: *and* he gets the rest of my chicken... \\n\\njerry: so, is tonight \"the night\"? \\n\\nelaine: you never know... \\n\\njerry: oooh! bay-bee *doll*! \\n\\njerry: boy, do you smell something? \\n\\nelaine: do i smell something? what am i, hard of smelling? of *course* i smell something. \\n\\njerry: what is it? \\n\\nelaine: i think it\\'s b.o.! \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s b.o. the *valet* must have had b.o. \\n\\njerry: it *can\\'t* be. nobody has b.o. like this. \\n\\nelaine: jerry. it\\'s *b*.*o*. \\n\\njerry: but the whole car smells. \\n\\nelaine: so? \\n\\njerry: so when somebody has b.o., the \"o\" usually stays with the \"b\". once the \"b\" leaves, the \"o\" goes with it. \\n\\nelaine: i can\\'t believe you ski! \\n\\ncarl: i\\'m a great skier. \\n\\nelaine: yeah? what else? \\n\\ncarl: let\\'s see... i ski, i fish, i pillage, i plunder... \\n\\nelaine: [delightedly] oh! you \"pillage and plunder\"? \\n\\ncarl: ...when i travel. \\n\\nelaine: see? finally, *finally* i get to meet a man who pillages and plunders! i\\'m so lucky. \\n\\ngeorge: this\\'ll only take a second. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, i\\'m going to poke around... \\n\\ngeorge: [to himself] hey, whatd\\'ya know? look at that! a *lesbian* sighting. oh-ho! my lucky day. they\\'re *so* fascinating. why is that? because they don\\'t want us. you gotta respect that... \\n\\ngeorge: [to himself] oh, my god! it\\'s susan! what do i do? \\n\\nsusan: george? \\n\\ngeorge: [to himself] argh! [to susan] susan! hi! oh, boy! what are you doing here?! \\n\\nsusan: renting a video! what do you got there? \\n\\ngeorge: oh, ... some stupid movie... \\n\\nsusan: this is mona. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, hi... \\n\\nmona: pleasure to meet you. \\n\\ngeorge: yes. well... \\n\\nmona: well, i\\'ll let you two, uh... catch up. \\n\\nsusan: you okay? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. yes! i just haven\\'t seen you in a long time. \\n\\nsusan: and you didn\\'t expect me to be holding hands with a woman. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, *please*! me? c\\'mon! that\\'s *great*! are you kidding? i think thats fan*tastic*! i\\'ve always encouraged experimentation! i\\'m the first guy in the pool! who do you think you\\'re talking to? \\n\\nsusan: i *know* who i\\'m talking to. \\n\\ngeorge: of course you do... it\\'s just, uh, y\\'know, i-i never *knew*, uh, that, uh... \\n\\nsusan: i liked women? \\n\\ngeorge: there you go. \\n\\ngeorge: so, uh, how long has this been going on? \\n\\nsusan: since you and i broke up. \\n\\ngeorge: ssssso, after me, you... went that way? \\n\\nsusan: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, i think that\\'s fantastic. good for you. nice. that\\'s very nice. \\n\\nsusan: so, what have you got there? \\n\\ngeorge: oh, i, uh-- \\n\\nsusan: oh, ``rochelle, rochelle\\'\\' \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s a foreign movie... a *film*, is what it is, actually. \\n\\nsusan: yeah... a lot of nudity in that, huh? \\n\\ngeorge: no, no, no... just a *tiny* bit... it\\'s not even *frontal* nudity. it\\'s... *sidal* nudity... \\n\\nclerk: next. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, that\\'s me. \\n\\nsusan: alright, well... good seeing you, george. \\n\\ngeorge: yes, good to see you, too. and good luck with, uh... with the whole thing, there. \\n\\nclerk: uh, what are you returning? \\n\\ngeorge: [embarrassed pause] ``rochelle, rochelle\\'\\'. \\n\\nclerk: ah, ``rochelle, rochelle\\'\\'... \"a young girl\\'s strange, erotic journey from milan to minsk\"... \\n\\nclerk: uh, that\\'ll be, uh... $3.49. \\n\\ngeorge: $3.49? it says $1.49. \\n\\nclerk: well, you didn\\'t rewind it. there\\'s a $2.00 charge for not rewinding. \\n\\ngeorge: what! there\\'s no signs here! this is an outrage! \\n\\nkramer: george, don\\'t give him any money for that. it\\'ll cost you less to keep it another day, rewind it and bring it back tomorrow. don\\'t give him the satisfaction. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m not giving you the satisfaction. i\\'m gonna watch it again... \\n\\njerry: so, this morning i go down to the garage to check the car out. i figure by this time, the odour molecules have had at least twelve hours to de-smellify. i open the car door, like a *punch* in the *face*, the stench hits me-- it\\'s almost as if it had *gained* strength throughout the night... \\n\\nelaine: y\\'know i can think of at *least* six known offensive odours that i would *rather* smell than what\\'s livin\\' in your car. \\n\\njerry: what about skunk? \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t mind skunk. \\n\\njerry: horse manure? \\n\\nelaine: i *loooove* horse manure. \\n\\njerry: well, i\\'ve never seen anything like this in my life. in fact, i went to the car wash, they want 250 dollars to detail it, and get the smell out. i\\'m not payin\\' for that. that\\'s not my responsibility. in fact, i\\'m drivin\\' up to that restaurant now, and *demand* they pay for it. \\n\\nelaine: absolutely. \\n\\nelaine: listen, lemme ask you something. when you\\'re with a guy, and he tells you he has to get up early, what does that mean? \\n\\njerry: it means he\\'s lying. \\n\\nelaine: wow... \\n\\njerry: why? is that what he told you? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, last night. oh, come on... men *have* to get up early some time... \\n\\njerry: no. never. \\n\\nelaine: jerry! i\\'m *sure* i\\'ve seen men on the street early in the morning. \\n\\njerry: well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but a man will *always* trade sleep for sex. \\n\\nelaine: is it possible i\\'m not as attractive as i think i am? \\n\\njerry: anything\\'s *possible*... \\n\\njerry: what\\'s the matter with you? \\n\\nkramer: steinbrenner! he\\'s ruinin\\' my life... \\n\\njerry: oh yeah, steinbrenner... \\n\\nkramer: i don\\'t think i can take another season with him, jerry. he\\'ll just trade away their best young prospects, just like he did with beuner, mcgee, drabek... mcgriff... \\n\\njerry: i know the list... \\n\\nkramer: what\\'s that smell? \\n\\njerry: what smell? \\n\\nkramer: ooooh... you stink. \\n\\njerry: whatd\\'ya mean i stink? \\n\\nkramer: you *stink*. why don\\'t you go take a shower? \\n\\njerry: i showered! oh, wait a second... since i showered, i\\'ve been in the car! \\n\\nelaine: so? \\n\\njerry: don\\'t you see what\\'s happening here? it\\'s attached itself to me! it\\'s alive! \\n\\nelaine: if it attached itself to you, then... oh, my god! that\\'s why carl said he had to get up early! because i stink! jerry, he thinks i have b.o.! me! \\n\\nkramer: what happened? \\n\\njerry: what happened? my car *stinks* is what happened. and it\\'s destroying the lives of everyone in it\\'s path. \\n\\ngeorge: what is that? b.o.? \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: this is *unbelievable* b.o. \\n\\njerry: i know... i was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me in his 38 years in the business, he\\'s never smelled anything like it. \\n\\ngeorge: so, let me ask you. do you think i could have done this? \\n\\njerry: no, no. it\\'s the valet guy. \\n\\ngeorge: no, no, i mean, driving susan to lesbianism. \\n\\njerry: oh... no, that\\'s ridiculous. \\n\\ngeorge: what if her experience with me *drove* her to it? \\n\\njerry: suicide, maybe, not lesbianism. \\n\\ngeorge: the woman she\\'s \"lesbianing\" with? susan told me she\\'s *never* been with a guy. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, this isn\\'t even b.o.! this is *beyond* b.o.! it\\'s *b*.b.o.! \\n\\njerry: there should be a b.o. squad that patrols the city like a \"smell gestapo\". to sniff \\'em out, strip \\'em down, and wash them with a big, soapy brush... \\n\\ngeorge: y\\'know, the funny thing is, somehow i find her more appealing now... it\\'s like if i knew she was a lesbian when we went out, i never would\\'ve broken up with her. \\n\\njerry: lemme see if i understand this... on second thought... \\n\\njerry: here he is... that\\'s the guy! (rolls up window) no, thank you, go back... go back... i\\'ll park it! you go back! \\n\\nrestaurateur: what do you mean-- \"stunk up\"? \\n\\njerry: i mean the car *stinks*! george, does the car stink? \\n\\ngeorge: stinks. \\n\\njerry: stinks! \\n\\nrestaurateur: well, perhaps *you\\'re* the one who has the odour... \\n\\njerry: hey, i\\'ve never smelled in my *life*, buddy! \\n\\nrestaurateur: really? well, i smell you now. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s from the car! \\n\\nrestaurateur: well, maybe *you\\'re* the one who stunk up the car, rather than the car stinking up you! \\n\\ngeorge: oh, it\\'s the chicken and the egg... \\n\\njerry: thank you very much... well, then go out and smell the car; see which smells worse. \\n\\nrestaurateur: i don\\'t have time to smell cars. \\n\\ngeorge: forget about smelling the car. smell the valet. go to the source... \\n\\njerry: you\\'ve gotta smell the car \\n\\nrestaurateur: i\\'m a busy man \\n\\njerry: c\\'mon! one whiff! \\n\\nrestaurateur: alright, one whiff... \\n\\nrestaurateur: alright! i give up! i admit it! it stinks! now will you let me out! \\n\\njerry: alright, will you pay for the cleaning? \\n\\nrestaurateur: yes! 50 dollars! i\\'ll give you 50 dollars! \\n\\nrestaurateur: i\\'m not paying for *that*. they\\'ve already got my seven dollars... [sarcastically] \"...erotic journey from milan to minsk\"... \\n\\ncarl: the valet had such bad b.o.? \\n\\nelaine: oh, man, just *rampant*, **mutant** b.o. the \"o\" went from the valet\\'s \"b\", to the car, to me. it clings to everything. jerry thinks it\\'s an entity. but i showered and i shampoo\\'ed, so... \\n\\ncarl: that\\'s a relief... \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\ncarl: it\\'s still there... \\n\\nelaine: no, no, no! it *can\\'t* be! i shampoo\\'ed! i rinsed! i repeated! \\n\\ngeorge: listen, i gotta ask you i was a little concerned that perhaps i was responsible in some way for your, uh... metamorphosis. \\n\\nclerk: that\\'ll be $98.00. \\n\\ngeorge: what $98.00? \\n\\nclerk: that\\'s what i said. $98.00. \\n\\ngeorge: how could that piece of *crap* cost $98.00!? \\n\\ngeorge: so, was it me? \\n\\nsusan: oh, don\\'t be ridiculous! is that what you wanted to talk to me about? [gives him the $35] here. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, thanks. thanks a lot. i\\'ll pay you back. \\n\\nsusan: yeah, *sure*... i gotta go. \\n\\ngeorge: listen. let me ask you something. if you and mona were ever to... dance, how do you decide who leads? i mean... do you take turns? do you discuss it beforehand? how does that work? \\n\\nsusan: you\\'re an idiot. \\n\\ngeorge: why? that\\'s a *legitimate* sociological question. \\n\\nsusan: i\\'ll see ya. and george, by the way... you stink... real bad. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s not me! it\\'s the car! \\n\\nmona: i didn\\'t think i\\'d come. \\n\\nkramer: i knew you would. \\n\\nmona: oh, kramer! \\n\\ncar washer: we spray everything with ozium-d, let it de-ionise, vacuum the spray out with a de-ionising machine. hit it with high-pressure compressed air, and wet-dry vac it to extract the remaining liquids. we top it off with one of our seven air-fresheners, in your case, i would recommend the jasmine, or the potpourri. \\n\\njerry: let\\'s do it. \\n\\nhairdresser: the first thing we\\'re gonna do is flush the follicles with the five essential oils. then, we put you under a vapour machine, and then a heated cap. then, we shampoo and shampoo and condition and condition. then, we saturate the hair in diluted vinegar-- two parts vinegar, 10 parts water. now, if that doesn\\'t work, we have one last resort. tomato sauce. \\n\\nelaine: tomato sauce? \\n\\njerry: wait a minute! it still smells! it still smells! \\n\\ncarl: it still smells. \\n\\njerry: it still smells! \\n\\ngeorge: how could it still smell after all that? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know! \\n\\ngeorge: well, what are you gonna do? \\n\\njerry: i\\'ll tell you what i\\'m gonna do, i\\'m selling that car! \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'re *selling* the car!? \\n\\njerry: you don\\'t understand what i\\'m up against. this is a force more powerful than anything you can imagine. even *superman* would be helpless against this kind of stench. and i\\'ll take anything i can get for it. \\n\\ngeorge: maybe i\\'ll buy it. \\n\\njerry: are you crazy? don\\'t you understand what i\\'m saying to you? this is not just an odour-- you need a *priest* to get rid of this thing! \\n\\nelaine: i still smell! \\n\\njerry: you see! you see what i\\'m saying to you? it\\'s a presence! it\\'s the beast! \\n\\nsusan: kramer! kramer! kramer, open up, i know you\\'re in there! \\n\\njerry: susan! \\n\\nsusan: kramer! \\n\\njerry: what is going on? \\n\\nsusan: you know what\\'s going on? first, he vomits on me. then, he burns down my father\\'s cabin. and now, he\\'s taken mona away from me. \\n\\ngeorge: he stole your girlfriend? \\n\\nsusan: yes. she\\'s in *love* with him. \\n\\ngeorge: amazing. i drive them to lesbianism, he brings \\'em back. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s the *least* of what you\\'ve accomplished... \\n\\nelaine: wait a minute, wait a minute. kramer, kramer... hold on a second. i don\\'t get this. this woman has *never* been with a man her *entire* life-- \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m kramer. \\n\\ngeorge: i know what you\\'re going through. women. who knows what they want? \\n\\nsusan: i just don\\'t know what she sees in *kramer*. \\n\\ngeorge: listen. you\\'re beautiful. you\\'re intelligent. you\\'ll meet other girls... \\n\\nsusan: you think so? \\n\\ngeorge: yes, i know so. you happen to be a very eligible lesbian. \\n\\nsusan: you\\'re very sweet... \\n\\ngeorge: hey, i know what i\\'m talking about. i gotta be honest with you, i gotta tell ya... ever since i saw you holding hands with that woman, i can\\'t get you out of my mind. \\n\\nsusan: really? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, you\\'re just so... hip. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, my god... \\n\\nsusan: what? \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s allison. i dated her right after you. she\\'s obsessed with me. \\n\\nallison: george? \\n\\ngeorge: allison! hi! oh, my god! how are you? \\n\\nallison: good. you know, you owe me $50... \\n\\ngeorge: right. i don\\'t have it on me. allison, this is susan. susan, allison. \\n\\nallison: nice to meet you... \\n\\nsusan: nice to meet you... \\n\\nallison: that\\'s a beautiful vest... \\n\\nsusan: thank you... \\n\\nkramer: i don\\'t understand it. i was with her last night in my apartment; it was very romantic. y\\'know with that fake wood wallpaper, the atmosphere is *fabulous* in there, now. it\\'s like a ski lodge. \\n\\nsalesman: what year did you say this was? \\n\\njerry: \\'90. \\n\\nkramer: anyway, we were on the couch, i move to hug her, next thing she tells me she\\'s leaving; she\\'s got to get up early. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s strange... \\n\\nsalesman: how many miles you got on this thing? \\n\\njerry: 23 000. \\n\\nkramer: and i was looking good, too. i had a nice, new shirt on, i\\'m wearing *your* jacket... \\n\\njerry: wait a second... my jacket! i wore that in the car! the beast! \\n\\nsalesman: i can\\'t sell this car. \\n\\njerry: this... **thing**... has got to be stopped! \\n\\nhairdresser: so, what do you want to do? \\n\\nelaine: sauce me. \\n\\njerry: i have a friend who is about to get married, they\\'re having the bachelor party and the bridal shower on the same day... so it\\'s conceivable that while she\\'s getting the lingerie, he\\'d be at a nude bar watching a table dancer wearing the same outfit. that is possible. but to me, the difference between being single and being married, is the form of government. you see, when you\\'re single, you are the dictator of your own life. i have complete power. i can give the order to fall asleep on the sofa with the tv on in the middle of the day, no-one can overrule me! when you\\'re married, you\\'re part of a vast decision-making body. before anything gets done there are meetings. committees have to study the situation. and this is if the marriage works. that\\'s what\\'s so painful about divorce you get impeached and you\\'re not even the president! \\n\\ngeorge: hey, is it my imagination, or do really good looking women walk a lot faster than everybody else? \\n\\nelaine: we don\\'t walk that fast... \\n\\ngeorge: no seriously... \\n\\nelaine: seriously, we don\\'t. \\n\\ngeorge: the better looking they are, the faster they go! i mean, i see they out there on the street, they\\'re zooming around, like a blur. like they have a motor on their ass. \\n\\nelaine: (yelling to jerry in the bedroom) hey jerry, come on, let\\'s go. we\\'re gonna miss the previews! \\n\\nelaine: hey, how are we gettin\\' to scott drake\\'s party on saturday night? \\n\\njerry: oh, drake\\'s party, i forgot to buy a present. \\n\\ngeorge: i gotta buy a present now? \\n\\nelaine: of course you do, it\\'s an engagement party. \\n\\ngeorge: it never ends, this present stuff! engagement present! then they get married, you gonna have to get them something for that! then the baby, there\\'s another present. then the baby starts getting their presents. i don\\'t even like drake. \\n\\njerry: you don\\'t like the drake? \\n\\ngeorge: hate the drake. \\n\\nelaine: i *love* the drake. \\n\\njerry: how could you not like the drake? \\n\\ngeorge: who\\'s the drake? \\n\\nelaine: \"who\\'s the drake\"? \\n\\njerry: the drake is good! \\n\\nelaine: so listen, what are you gonna get him?

\\n\\nkramer: alright, now, we gotta go out. we gotta buy a wheelchair. \\n\\ngeorge: a wheelchair? what for? \\n\\nkramer: well, you know i went to the hospital today, and i saw the woman, you know, and the wheelchair is totalled, we gotta get her another one! \\n\\ngeorge: doesn\\'t she have collision? \\n\\nkramer: george, i\\'m in love with her! \\n\\ngeorge: well, my father works for the united volunteers, maybe he can get her one. \\n\\nkramer: no! she needs it now! \\n\\ngeorge: what about these two? aren\\'t they gonna chip in? \\n\\nkramer: well... \\n\\nelaine: hey, we told you not to park there! \\n\\ngeorge: can\\'t we just fix the old one? \\n\\nkramer: alright, alright. fine george! don\\'t chip in! but some day, we\\'re gonna be driving along, we\\'re gonna look out the window, and see her crawling along 5th avenue! is that what you want? \\n\\ngeorge: alright, alright! we\\'ll buy her a wheelchair! wheelchairs, engagement presents.. it never ends! \\n\\nsalesman: this is out best model. the cougar 9000. it\\'s the rolls royce of wheelchairs. this is like... you\\'re almost glad to be handicapped. \\n\\nkramer: so now, what\\'s this got? \\n\\nsalesman: inductive joystick, dynamic braking, flip-up arms, it\\'s fully loaded. i put stephen hawking in one of these two months ago, he\\'s lovin\\' it! it\\'s rated number one by hospital supply and prosthetic magazine. \\n\\ngeorge: how much? \\n\\nsalesman: 6200. \\n\\ngeorge: do you have something a little more... less expensive? \\n\\njerry and elaine: hey drake! hi drake! \\n\\njerry: hey alison! hey, there\\'s the tv, elaine, look at that! \\n\\nelaine: my god this is fantastic! tell me, were you guys just blown away or what? \\n\\nthe drake: oh yeah, yeah... it\\'s fantastic... \\n\\njerry: i am gonna make good use of this! i\\'m watching every superbowl here, every big fight.... \\n\\nelaine: oh man, there is nothing like a really big tv, huh? \\n\\njerry: so where\\'re we eatin\\'? \\n\\nthe drake: well, actually... jerry... \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m *really* hungry! \\n\\nthe drake: ... we just broke up... \\n\\njerry: when did this happen? \\n\\nthe drake: about 20 minutes ago... hey, i am really sorry about this guys... whew! \\n\\njerry: (looking at the tv) look at the picture on this thing... \\n\\nelaine: oh, cristal clear! \\n\\njerry: they know how to make \\'em... \\n\\nelaine: are there any good italian restaurants around here?

\\n\\nsalesman: oh sure, it just doesn\\'t have any of the thrills of the cougar. \\n\\ngeorge: like what? \\n\\nsalesman: for example, your tremor-damping. \\n\\nkramer: now what\\'s that? \\n\\nsalesman: it helps to control the direction regardless of the operator\\'s tremors or spasticity. \\n\\nkramer: well, is it alright if i try it? \\n\\nsalesman: hop in! \\n\\nkramer: oh yeah! \\n\\nsalesman: i tell ya... \\n\\nsalesman: when i see someone enjoying themselves like that, it reminds me why i got into this business in the first place. \\n\\ngeorge: how much? \\n\\nsalesman: how about $240? \\n\\ngeorge & kramer: we\\'ll take it! \\n\\nelaine: drake gave her the tv? \\n\\njerry: he gave her all the gifts; he felt guilty. \\n\\nelaine: well, she can\\'t keep it, it\\'s not fair, that\\'s *our* tv! \\n\\njerry: i know it is! \\n\\nelaine: boy, i am really starting to dislike the drake! \\n\\njerry: i hate the drake! maybe the whole thing was a scam. anybody can just get engaged and get presents and just keep them all. maybe they\\'re on their way to chicago tomorrow and do the whole thing all over again. \\n\\nelaine: they don\\'t know anybody in chicago. \\n\\njerry: don\\'t worry, they\\'ll make friends fast with that nice tv. \\n\\ngeorge: hey. \\n\\njerry: hey, guess what? the drake broke up. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know about defraying. \\n\\ngeorge: why? \\n\\njerry: we\\'re not gettin\\' that tv. \\n\\ngeorge: what do you mean? the engagement is off, we get the tv back. that\\'s business. \\n\\nelaine: the drakette took it. \\n\\ngeorge: she can\\'t take it. it\\'s not hers, it\\'s theirs. once there\\'s no theirs there\\'s no hers, it should be ours. \\n\\nelaine: well, she has it! \\n\\ngeorge: (upset) i *told* you the drake was bad! i hate the drake! \\n\\ngeorge: maybe we should call her. \\n\\nelaine: well, who\\'s gonna call? \\n\\njerry: you are. \\n\\nelaine: what? why is it me who always has to do these things? \\n\\njerry: because that\\'s your thing! \\n\\nelaine: what? calling people i hardly know, and demanding they return expensive gifts, that\\'s my \"thing\"? \\n\\njerry: yeah, that\\'s your thing. \\n\\nelaine: alright, gimme the phone... it\\'s my \"thing\"... \\n\\njerry: (to george) you know, i\\'m thinking about getting a yo-yo. \\n\\ngeorge: really? \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: i could see that... \\n\\n(alison through phone): hello? \\n\\nelaine: alison! hi, this is elaine... \\n\\n(alison through phone): i gave all the gifts to charity. \\n\\nelaine: oh, okay... well thanks a lot... sorry again about you and the drake... \\n\\n(alison though phone): i hate the drake. \\n\\nelaine: everybody does. bye-bye.... \\n\\nelaine: she gave it to charity. \\n\\njerry: charity?!? that\\'s apalling. \\n\\ngeorge: how could anybody be so selfish and inconsiderate! \\n\\nkramer: well, i gave her the wheelchair! you should have seen the look on her face. and then she told me, that the old wheelchair, that wasn\\'t any good anyway! so you see george, the whole incident was a god blessing! yeah! \\n\\ngeorge: you mean a blessing in disguise? \\n\\nkramer: yeah.... \\n\\nlady: and i would also like to personally thank our gracious host frank costanza, who has earned the silver circle award and is our unanimous choice for the united volunteer representative of the month! \\n\\nlady: due to his tireless effort, he personally raised over $22,000. that\\'s a lot of wheelchairs! \\n\\nlady: on behalf of the united volunteers of greater new york, we thank you! \\n\\nfrank: well... thank you very much! \\n\\ncop: mr. costanza? \\n\\nfrank: yes? \\n\\ncop: you\\'re under arrest. \\n\\nfrank: under arrest? what for? \\n\\ncop: reckless endangerment of public safety, and violation of traffic code 342-a. \\n\\nfrank: what\\'s that? \\n\\ncop: parking in a handicap spot. let\\'s go... \\n\\nfrank: george! george! \\n\\njerry: your father got arrested? for what? \\n\\ngeorge: parking in a handicap spot. right in the middle of his united volunteers meeting. when he got back, he chased after me with a baseball bat. \\n\\njerry: ho-ly! \\n\\ngeorge: between the car getting totalled, the towing charge and the fine, there\\'s no way i can ever pay him back... \\n\\njerry: so what are you gonna do? \\n\\ngeorge: i agreed to become his butler. \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\njerry: what\\'s the matter? \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s over! \\n\\njerry: what\\'s over? \\n\\nkramer: me and lola.... \\n\\ngeorge: the woman we bought the wheelchair for? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, she dumped me! \\n\\njerry: she dumped you? \\n\\nkramer: she dumped me! she rolled right over me! said i was a hipster dufus. am i a hipster dufus? \\n\\njerry & george: (hesitatingly) ... no... \\n\\nkramer: said i\\'m not good looking enough for her. not good looking! jerry, look at me, look at my face, huh, am i beautiful? george, am i beautiful? \\n\\ngeorge: ...you\\'re very attractive... \\n\\nkramer: yeah... she says she doesn\\'t wanna see me again. told me to drop dead! \\n\\njerry: drop dead? \\n\\ngeorge: boy, even i never heard that one... \\n\\njerry: she\\'s pretty rough! \\n\\nkramer: yeesh-jip! \\n\\ngeorge: well, we just blew 240 bucks on a wheelchair. \\n\\njerry: 240 bucks? \\n\\ngeorge: well, it was slightly used... \\n\\njerry: used? \\n\\nfrank (picking up his shoes): i don\\'t think you did such a good job on these... \\n\\ngeorge: what!? \\n\\nfrank: you\\'re supposed to your face there! do you see your face in there? \\n\\nfrank: yeah? ...oh really?...oh... how about that?... right down a hill huh? okay! alight! bye! \\n\\nfrank: george, forget about the shoes. want you to do something for me (scribbles something on a piece of paper). this handicapped woman had an accident. somebody gave her a used wheelchair with defective brakes. \\n\\ngeorge: sons of bitches! \\n\\nfrank: anyway, i want you to pick up this big screen tv, and deliver it to her. \\n\\ngeorge: big screen tv? \\n\\nfrank: do you think you can handle it? \\n\\nallison: yes? \\n\\ngeorge: hi, we\\'re from the united volunteers, we\\'ve come to pick up the tv. \\n\\nallison: oh great, it\\'s right over there. \\n\\nkramer: ooh, it\\'s a big one! \\n\\ngeorge: who\\'s got the receipt? \\n\\nelaine: i do. \\n\\ngeorge: will they give us cash? \\n\\njerry: that\\'s their policy. \\n\\ngeorge: i hate this mall, there are never any spaces here... \\n\\nkramer: why don\\'t you park in front of the hydrant? \\n\\ngeorge: what if there is a fire? \\n\\nkramer: what are the chances of that? \\n\\n[setting: night club] \\n\\njerry: to me, the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. are we gonna have to have aa-type meetings for these people? they\\'ll go \"hi, my name is bill, and the one thing i\\'m worried about is to have a stereo and a cream-colored couch.\" according to most studies, people\\'s number-one fear is public speaking. number two is death. *death* is number two! now, this means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you\\'re better off in the casket than doing the eulogy. \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s] \\n\\nkramer: why can\\'t i play kramer? \\n\\njerry: look we\\'ve been through this already. you\\'re not an actor! \\n\\nkramer: neither are you. \\n\\njerry: i know. so why do we need two people in the show that can\\'t act? \\n\\nkramer: oh come on jerry. how hard is it to act. you say something, i\\'ll pretend it\\'s funny. \\n\\njerry: my grandmother\\'s in the hospital. \\n\\nkramer: ha ha ha. your grandmother\\'s in the hospital! \\n\\njerry: this is real believable. \\n\\nkramer: what you didn\\'t think i was really laughing? \\n\\njerry: it stinks. \\n\\nkramer: let me see you do it. \\n\\njerry: say something funny. \\n\\nkramer: alright. i\\'ve never been to mars but i imagine it\\'s quite lovely. \\n\\njerry: ah.......... \\n\\nkramer: mine was better than that! come on look. (starts to laugh again, jerry too) \\n\\ngeorge: why are two pretending to be laughing? \\n\\njerry: we\\'re acting. (they stop laughing) \\n\\ngeorge: oh, real good. (george makes a face like you stink) any word from nbc? \\n\\njerry: no. \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t understand. they\\'re supposed to be casting this week. something\\'s wrong. maybe they\\'re not doing it. \\n\\nkramer: (to jerry) well at least let me audition. \\n\\njerry: (to george) he wants to play kramer in the pilot. \\n\\nkramer: (to george) yeah! \\n\\ngeorge: out of the question. \\n\\nkramer: oughh! \\n\\ngeorge: (to jerry) how could we not hear anything? what\\'s with this russel? what\\'s he doing? (jerry raises his arms and shoulders like he doesn\\'t know) \\n\\n[setting: peter mcmanus cafe, an italian restaurant] \\n\\nrussell: i really appreciate you coming. \\n\\nelaine: oh, that\\'s o.k. i don\\'t have much time though. so... \\n\\nrussell: all right, first of all, i want to apologize for all the phone calls. it\\'s just--it\\'s just-- (awkward pause) i don\\'t understand, we went out once... \\n\\nelaine: that was two months ago. \\n\\nrussell: yes i know. i just-- i can\\'t get you out of my mind. ever since that-- that day in the restaurant when we met... (we see a flashback from \\'the shoes\\' of elaine showing her cleavage and asking russell for his ketchup secret) \\n\\nelaine: russell, you are the president of nbc. you can have any woman you want. (picks up the bowl of munchies on the table) \\n\\nrussell: but i want you. \\n\\nelaine: god i hate these mixtures. why don\\'t they just put pretzels on the table. even peanuts would be good, but i don\\'t know how eats these cheesy things (she does). \\n\\nrussell: is it something i said... or did? \\n\\nelaine: um... look russell... you\\'re a very sweet guy. but i got to be honest with you. i don\\'t like television... and that\\'s your world. that\\'s your life. i mean maybe if you were in... i don\\'t know... greenpeace or something, that would be different, but network television... i mean, come on, russell, you\\'re part of the problem. \\n\\nrussell: oh elaine, we\\'re doing some really very interesting things right now. we\\'ve got some very exciting pilots for next season. we have one with a bright young comedian, jerry seinfeld. \\n\\nelaine: oh yeah, oh yeah. i\\'ve heard of him. he\\'s that \"did you ever notice this? did you ever notice that?\" guy. \\n\\nrussell: yeah. anyway it\\'s a ground breaking show. \\n\\nelaine: really? what is it about? \\n\\nrussell: (a little more enthusiast) well, really, it\\'s very unusual. it\\'s about nothing. \\n\\nelaine: (surprised) what do you mean it\\'s about nothing? \\n\\nrussell: (starts doing george at the first meeting with nbc in \\'the pitch\\') for example, what did you do today? \\n\\nelaine: um, i got up. um, i went to work. then i came here. \\n\\nrussell: there\\'s a show. that\\'s a show. \\n\\nelaine: russell, see, i\\'m really not interested in this stuff and i do have to go to work (she gets up). so... \\n\\nrussell: (stops doing george, he\\'s down again) elaine, when--when--when are we gonna see each other again. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m sorry russell. i\\'m sorry o.k.? bye-bye. (russell, still sitting watches her leaving). \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s] \\n\\njerry: hello? yeah he\\'s here. (to kramer) hey! it\\'s for you. \\n\\ngeorge: he\\'s getting phone calls here now? (he\\'s standing near the counter and eating chips out of a big bag) \\n\\njerry: (to george) again with the sweat pants? \\n\\ngeorge: what? i\\'m comfortable. \\n\\njerry: you know the message you\\'re sending out to the world with these sweat pants? you\\'re telling the world \"i give up. i can\\'t compete in normal society. i\\'m miserable, so i might as well be comfortable.\" (george is baffled) \\n\\nkramer: (to the phone) hold on a second i got another call. hello? yeah, he\\'ll call you back. (jerry and george look at each other) \\n\\njerry: (to kramer) who is it? \\n\\nkramer: that\\'s nbc. \\n\\njerry: nbc!?! give me the phone! \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m in the middle of a conversation here. \\n\\njerry: get off the phone! \\n\\nkramer: (to the phone) look, i\\'ll call you back. (hangs up) \\n\\njerry: you know i\\'m waiting to hear from them. who was it? \\n\\nkramer: russell dalrimple\\'s secretary. \\n\\njerry: all right. now you\\'re doing something to help me.

(jerry knows george is hypochondriac. see \\'the heart attack\\') \\n\\ngeorge: (to the cab driver) excuse me, do you see anything on my lip here? \\n\\ncabbie: yeah, it\\'s like a discoloration. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, my god. \\n\\ncabbie: yeah, it\\'s all white. \\n\\ngeorge: (to jerry) it\\'s all white jerry! it\\'s all white! \\n\\njerry: would you stop? \\n\\ncabbie: i would get that checked out if i were you. \\n\\ngeorge: again with the checked out. i\\'m not going to the doctor. if i don\\'t to the doctor, then nothing will happen to me. if i go he might find something. \\n\\njerry: if you go, maybe they\\'ll catch it in time. \\n\\ngeorge: catch what in time? \\n\\njerry: whatever it is. \\n\\ngeorge: you think it\\'s something? \\n\\ncabbie: ah! i hate these bums with their filthy rags. no no no, i don\\'t want it, get away, get away from my car (he starts his wipers) \\n\\njerry: (to george) you know these squeegee-- oh my god! it\\'s crazy joe devola. \\n\\njoe devola: (through the opened window\\'s cab) good luck on the pilot jerry. (the cab pulls away) \\n\\n[setting: nbc] \\n\\nstu: (to george) yeah i think i see it. it\\'s like a white discoloration. \\n\\ngeorge: (to jay) what do you think it is? \\n\\njay: it\\'s like a... white discoloration. (we understand now why a sitcom needs so many producers) \\n\\ncasting director: o.k. guys, are we ready to start? \\n\\njerry: yeah, where is russell? i thought he was gonna be here. \\n\\nstu: oh you know i don\\'t know. i saw him in the hall this morning, i said hello to him. he walked right past me. \\n\\njay: he must be worried about the fall schedule. \\n\\nstu: ah, it\\'s a real bear. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. so what\\'s going on? we\\'re gonna shoot the pilot and then it\\'s gonna be on tv the following week? \\n\\nstu: yeah. right. \\n\\ncasting director: this is mark matts. he\\'ll be auditioning for the role of george. (the guy looks very cool and casual, and has a lot of hair) \\n\\nmark: hey how you doing? \\n\\njerry: (thinking) they\\'ve gotta be kidding. \\n\\ngeorge: (thinking) this guy\\'s perfect. \\n\\ncasting director: o.k. let\\'s read this. i\\'ll be reading jerry\\'s part. \\n\\nmark: anyone call for vandelay industries? (george is the only one in the room to find mark funny) \\n\\ncasting director: no. why? \\n\\nmark: listen to me. i told the unemployment office i was close to a job with vandelay industries and i gave them your phone number. so, when you answer the phone now, you\\'ve got to say \"vandelay industries\". \\n\\ncasting director: i\\'m vandelay industries? \\n\\nmark: right. \\n\\ncasting director: what is that? \\n\\nmark: you\\'re in latex. \\n\\ncasting director: what do i do with latex? \\n\\nmark: i don\\'t know, you manufacture it. \\n\\ncasting director: this is michael barth. another george. (he\\'s in sweat pants, bald, with glasses) \\n\\nall: hi michael. how you doing? \\n\\njerry: everything all right? \\n\\nmichael: i just came from the podiatrist. i have a mole on my foot. i\\'ve got a little gangrene, they\\'re probably gonna have to amputate. (everyone laugh except george) \\n\\ncasting director: any questions? \\n\\nmichael: yeah. what are we looking at here? is this guy like a real loser? \\n\\ngeorge: no, not a loser! \\n\\ncasting director: let\\'s start with the second scene. you have it here? \\n\\nmichael: a man gave me a, you know, massage. (everyone laugh except george) \\n\\ncasting director: so? \\n\\nmichael: well, he-- he had his hands, you know, and uh, he was, huh, ... \\n\\ncasting director: he was what? \\n\\nmichael: he was you know... he was touching and rubbing. (loud laughter) \\n\\ncasting director: that\\'s a massage. \\n\\nmichael: i think it moved. \\n\\ncasting director: this is melissa shannon. \\n\\nmelissa: hi. \\n\\nall: hi. how you doing. \\n\\ncasting director: melissa is reading for elaine. \\n\\nmelissa: it\\'s like a bald convention out there! (she saw george) sorry. i, uh, made a faux pas. \\n\\njerry: no you didn\\'t. he knows he\\'s bald. \\n\\nmelissa: so how about that guy wearing sweat pants? i mean did he do that for the part or does he walk around like that? (jerry approves with a nod, george drops his notepad on the coffee table) \\n\\ncasting director: o.k. shall we start? (melissa and the casting director sit down) \\n\\njerry: (getting up) uh, you know what? i\\'ll read with her. \\n\\nmelissa: oh, great. \\n\\njerry: alright, want to start? \\n\\nmelissa: yeah. \\n\\njerry: o.k. \\n\\nmelissa: ahem. what was that look? \\n\\njerry: what look? \\n\\nmelissa: that look you just gave me? \\n\\njerry: i gave a look? \\n\\nmelissa: yes. \\n\\ngeorge: thank you! thank you very much. (jerry and melissa stop and look at george) \\n\\ncasting director: let\\'s see some more kramers. \\n\\nall: hi. how you doing? \\n\\ntom: (to jerry and very seriously) how you doing? \\n\\njerry: (smiling and surprised at the way tom is talking) good. \\n\\ncasting director: what is this about? \\n\\ntom: (standing) levels. \\n\\ncasting director: levels? \\n\\ntom: yeah. i\\'m getting rid of all, all my furniture. all of it! i\\'m building... levels... with steps... completely carpeted... (making the gesture of carpeting steps) with pillows. (everyone laugh. he sits down) like ancient egypt. \\n\\ncasting director: i don\\'t know how you\\'re gonna be comfortable like that? \\n\\ntom: oh! i\\'ll be comfortable. (laughter, applause. he gets up, goes to the coffee table) \\n\\ngeorge: very nice \\n\\njerry: very good \\n\\ngeorge: very nice tom, that was terrific. \\n\\ntom: may i? (pointing the box of raisins) \\n\\ngeorge: sure. thank you for coming in. (tom eats some raisins) \\n\\njerry: (to george) it was a wonderful reading. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. really. \\n\\ntom: well, bye. \\n\\ngeorge: take care. take it easy. (tom leaves with the casting director) \\n\\nstu: now, i thought he was really good, very funny. \\n\\njerry: yeah, i liked him. \\n\\ngeorge: what happened to the raisins? \\n\\njay: yeah, there was a box of raisins there! \\n\\ngeorge: did he just steal the raisins? \\n\\nstu: you think he stole them? \\n\\ncasting director: (enters with the real kramer) this is martin van nostrand. \\n\\njerry: (to kramer) what are you doing here? \\n\\ncasting director: you two know each other? \\n\\nstu: wait a minute, i know you. you\\'re the guy from the calvin klein underwear ads. \\n\\nkramer: that\\'s true. \\n\\nkramer: (acting very bad) i saw joe dimaggio in dinky doughnuts again, but this time, i went in. (pause, stops acting) oh! uh, where\\'s the bathroom? \\n\\nstu: i think if you go down the hall, it\\'s on the right at the very end. \\n\\nkramer: yeah. be right back. (kramer leaves) \\n\\n(we see kramer, groaning and holding his stomach, running down the hall, and opening the bathroom\\'s door. someone in there says: \"sorry buddy, full house.\" we then see kramer outside leaving the building and running across the street to a restaurant \"sorry, customers only\" ...running into a movie theater \"hey you need a ticket!\" ...running through the park...) \\n\\n[setting: monk\\'s] \\n\\nelaine: so who\\'s playing elaine? \\n\\njerry: oh, don\\'t worry about it. very talented, very takented young actress. \\n\\nelaine: really? \\n\\njerry: yes. \\n\\nelaine: who is it? \\n\\njerry: she\\'s an eskimo, actually. \\n\\nelaine: oh, my god (not in the mood to be kidding) \\n\\njerry: she came down from juno by sleigh, she was in the iditarod. got to the finish line, just kept going. she\\'s got the dogs with her in the hotel room. \\n\\nelaine: listen, was russell at the casting? \\n\\njerry: no, he didn\\'t show up. \\n\\nelaine: you know, i\\'m a little bit worried about him. i don\\'t understand. we had one date two months ago. am i that charming and beautiful? \\n\\njerry: no. no you\\'re not. \\n\\nelaine: why do i keep setting you up? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know. \\n\\nelaine: (to the waitress) could we get a little more? (she doesn\\'t listen and walks away) aghh... you know ever since this new owner took over, the service here is *really* slow. \\n\\njerry: yeah. have you noticed anything else that\\'s different since the new management? \\n\\nelaine: mmm. they\\'re putting a little lemon in the tuna. i love that. \\n\\njerry: beside that. look at the waitresses. \\n\\nelaine: yeah? (we see that all the waitresses have big breasts) \\n\\njerry: what physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them? \\n\\nelaine: ah... \\n\\njerry: i mean look at this. every waitress working here has the same proportions. wouldn\\'t you say? \\n\\nelaine: yes, i would say. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s going on here. how is that possible? \\n\\nelaine: do you think it\\'s a coincidence? \\n\\njerry: no. i haven\\'t seen four women like this together outside of a russ meyer film. \\n\\nelaine: (to the waitress) hi. excuse me. who does all the hiring waitresses here? \\n\\nwaitress: he does. (pointing to the manager, mr. visaki) in fact we\\'re looking for another girl if you know anyone. (she walks away) \\n\\nelaine: you know what? that\\'s discriminatory. that is unfair. why should these women have all the advantages? it\\'s not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too? \\n\\njerry: hey that\\'s life. good-looking men have the same advantages. you don\\'t see any handsome homeless. \\n\\n[setting: doctor\\'s clinic] \\n\\ngeorge: you see, it\\'s right here. it\\'s all white... \\n\\ndoctor: oh yeah. yeah. i\\'ve never seen this before. \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'ve never seen this before? \\n\\ndoctor: i\\'m gonna have to take a biopsy on that. (george grabs the doctor\\'s arm) \\n\\ngeorge: (dramatically) a what? \\n\\ndoctor: a biopsy. \\n\\ngeorge: a biopsy? \\n\\ndoctor: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: cancer? is it cancer? do i have cancer? \\n\\ndoctor: well i don\\'t know what it is. \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s] \\n\\ngeorge: a biopsy! \\n\\njerry: what did he say? \\n\\ngeorge: he said he didn\\'t know what it was. \\n\\njerry: alright. so? \\n\\ngeorge: when i asked him if it was cancer, he didn\\'t give me a \"get outta here\". that\\'s what i wanted to hear \"cancer? get outta here?\" \\n\\njerry: well, maybe he doesn\\'t have a \"get outta here\" kind of personality. \\n\\ngeorge: how could you be a doctor and not say \"get outta here\"? it should be part of the training at medical school \"cancer? get outta here!\" \"go home! what are you crazy? it\\'s a little test. it\\'s nothing. you\\'re a real nut. you know that?\" (jerry gives him half of his sandwich to hopefully shut him up) i told you that god would never let me be successful. i never should\\'ve written that pilot. now the show will be a big hit, we\\'ll make millions of dollars, and i\\'ll be dead. dead jerry. because of this. (showing his lip) \\n\\njerry: can\\'t you at least die with a little dignity? \\n\\ngeorge: no i can\\'t. i can\\'t die with dignity. i have no dignity. i want to be the one person who doesn\\'t die with dignity. i live my whole life in shame. why should i die with dignity? \\n\\njerry: hey. what happened to you yesterday? \\n\\nkramer: i got mugged. \\n\\ngeorge: you got mugged? \\n\\njerry: mugged? \\n\\nkramer: well, i wouldn\\'t have minded it so much but i was running home to go to the bathroom. \\n\\njerry: why didn\\'t you use the bathroom in the building? \\n\\nkramer: it was full. i tried a few other places, you know, but that didn\\'t work. i mean it was an emergency jerrry. i was really percolating... so i decided to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me and... \\n\\njerry: yeah? \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s me. \\n\\njerry: come on up. \\n\\nkramer: but now i have a big problem, buddy. \\n\\njerry: what is it? \\n\\nkramer: well, i waited so long i-- i missed my chance. \\n\\njerry: you didn\\'t go? \\n\\nkramer: no. and now i can\\'t get it back. \\n\\njerry: the % thing to do is just not think about it. \\n\\nkramer: how could you not think about it? \\n\\nelaine: hey. \\n\\nkramer: (mumbles and leaves) \\n\\nelaine: what\\'s the matter with him? \\n\\njerry: he\\'s a little backed up. \\n\\nelaine: oh... \\n\\ngeorge: elaine. \\n\\nelaine: so i spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop. \\n\\njerry: oh, the sisters (he sits at the table) \\n\\ngeorge: (to jerry) have you seen the waitresses in there lately? i never had so much coffee in my life. \\n\\nelaine: so we decided i should go over there and apply for a job myself. \\n\\ngeorge: apply for a job? what for? \\n\\nelaine: because, it\\'s discriminatory (she comes back wearing one of jerry\\'s shirts, untucked) \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s a coincidence. \\n\\njerry: this is what you gonna wear? \\n\\nelaine: yeah. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re not gonna get the job. \\n\\nelaine: exactly. \\n\\njerry: (to the phone) hello. oh, hi. yeah i guess we could do that. at what time? all right. i\\'ll see you there. o.k., bye. (hangs up) \\n\\nelaine: who was it? \\n\\njerry: tv elaine. she wants to get together and talk about the part. \\n\\nelaine: what about the dogs? \\n\\njerry: they\\'re having sex in the hotel room. \\n\\n[setting: peter mcmanus cafe, same table as earlier] \\n\\n(jerry and tv elaine: sandi robbins) \\n\\nsandi: so, the elaine character is based on someone you know. \\n\\njerry: yes. \\n\\nsandi: and she\\'s really your ex-girlfriend? \\n\\njerry: uh, huh, yeah. \\n\\nsandi: i want to get to know her from the inside. what is she like? tell me about her. \\n\\njerry: well, she\\'s fascinated with greenland. she enjoys teasing animals, banlon, and seeing people running for their lives. she loves throwing garbage out the window, yet she\\'s extremely dainty. \\n\\nsandi: how would she eat a hamburger? \\n\\njerry: with her hands. \\n\\nsandi: what about pasta? \\n\\njerry: also with her hands. \\n\\nsandi: seriously... i want to experience everything she\\'s experienced. \\n\\njerry: everything? \\n\\nsandi: everything. \\n\\njerry: all right she cuts her pasta with a knife. \\n\\nsandi: that\\'s good. what\\'s her favorite movie? \\n\\njerry: shaft. \\n\\nsandi: you got to get me a picture. what about sex? \\n\\njerry: she likes talking during sex. \\n\\nsandi: oh... dirty talking? \\n\\njerry: no. just chitchat, movies, current events, regular stuff. you know sandi-- (looking at his watch) \\n\\nsandi: elaine. \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nsandi: call me elaine. \\n\\njerry: all right. elaine. \\n\\nsandi: how does elaine kiss? \\n\\njerry: well-- \\n\\nsandi: does she kiss... like this? (she kisses jerry) \\n\\njerry: actually she has a thing where she spirals her tongue around, it\\'s like-- \\n\\nsandi: like this? (kisses again but with the spiral) \\n\\njerry: i think you got it. \\n\\n[setting: monk\\'s] \\n\\nkramer: i like to eat spaghetti with just a fork. because i can keep the strands long, and i can slurp it out to my mouth. like this look. (faking to slurp spaghetti) now sex, i like the bottom. let them do all the work. you should be writing this stuff down... (waitress comes to take the order) bran lakes...100%. i got a big problem. \\n\\ntom: i\\'ll have a hamburger. that\\'s it. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, that\\'s good. oh, now i like to play golf. \\n\\ntom: this stuff doesn\\'t matter to me. see, i\\'m gonna do the character like me, not like you. \\n\\nkramer: you gotta play him like me. i\\'m kramer. \\n\\ntom: i\\'m kramer. \\n\\nkramer: whoa, i\\'m kramer. \\n\\nmr. visaki: (foreign accent) what can i do for you? would you like a table. \\n\\nelaine: no, i\\'d like to apply for a waitress job. \\n\\nmr. visaki: (looks elaine up and down) have you ever waited on tables before. \\n\\nelaine: oh yeah. i\\'ve been a professional waitress for the last 10 years. i\\'ve worked all over the city. these, uh, are my references. i\\'m sure you\\'ll find that i\\'m more than qualified. \\n\\nmr. visaki: i don\\'t think i need anyone else right now. \\n\\nelaine: you\\'re in big trouble mister. and i mean trouble with a capital \\'t\\'. (she leaves) \\n\\nmr. visaki: what? what did i do? \\n\\n[setting: the equal employment opportunity commission office] \\n\\nelaine: anyway there\\'s at least four of them, and they\\'re all huge. and one is bigger than the next. it\\'s like a russ meyer movie. \\n\\nfred: who\\'s russ meyer? \\n\\nelaine: oh, he\\'s this guy who made these terrible movies in the 70\\'s with these kinds of women. he\\'s obsessed. he\\'s obsessed with breasts. that\\'s hard to say. \\n\\nfred: anyway, go on. \\n\\nelaine: um... well, there\\'s not really much more to tell. he was looking for waitresses, and i went in to apply for the job. and, he looked me up and down and he rejected me. \\n\\nfred: (to a guy in the hall at the water cooler machine) paul. come in for a second. i want you to listen to this. \\n\\npaul: (to elaine) hi. \\n\\nelaine: hi. \\n\\nfred: paul, woman here claims there\\'s a restaurant on the west side that\\'s only hiring large-breasted women. \\n\\npaul: (to elaine) really? \\n\\n[setting: nbc, pilot\\'s set] \\n\\ntom: what do you mean made up? \\n\\njerry: it\\'s made up. haagen-dazs is made up. it\\'s not danish. \\n\\ntom: you\\'re crazy. \\n\\njerry: no i\\'m not. (to michael) george. is haagen-dazs danish? \\n\\nmichael: what do you mean danish? \\n\\ngeorge: (to the guy next to him) this guy stinks. (speaking of michael) \\n\\njerry: danish. is it from denmark? \\n\\nmichael: no, they make it in new jersey. it\\'s just a danishy name. \\n\\ntom: i can\\'t believe that. they fooled *me* jerry. \\n\\nrita: (to jay) boy, talk about a show about nothing. (jay, the integral producer, smiles stupidly) \\n\\ngeorge: uh, excuse me. (stopping them from rehearsing) excuse me. (he walks to the guy\\'s in charge of yelling \"take #!\") this--this is not right. may i? (the guy looks at george with a bothered face. george then walks up to tom and takes him away from jerry and michael to talk to him in private)(to tom) you see, you\\'re going \"they fooled *me* jerry!\" (george shakes his head with disapproval) you wanna hit \\'fooled\\' more \"they *fooled* me jerry!\". you see the difference? \\n\\ntom: i\\'m not gonna say it like that. \\n\\ngeorge: just a suggestion. (chuckles and walks back to the yelling guy) \\n\\nyelling guy: (with the same bothered face and while he\\'s looking at george) all right everybody, take a five. \\n\\ngeorge: (very casual and raising his hand in the air) yep. that\\'s five! \\n\\njerry: george? (walks away to talk privately. george, still casual, taps on jerry\\'s shoulder) i don\\'t have a lot of experience with this acting stuff. but from what i can gather, they\\'re a little touchy about being told how to say the lines. \\n\\ngeorge: why is that? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know, but they don\\'t seem to like it. by the way how am i doing? \\n\\ngeorge: oh, you\\'re fine... you\\'re fine. (looking at tom in the back and then quieter to jerry) so you think this guy playing kramer took the raisins? \\n\\njerry: why would he steal a box of raisins? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, it\\'s bizarre. (they both look around them suspiciously) \\n\\nrita: (to jay about russell) what\\'s with him? (to russell) russell? (louder) russell? \\n\\nrussell: what? \\n\\nrita: you o.k.? \\n\\nrussell: yeah. no, uh, i was just thinking of something. i\\'ll be back in a second. (he gets up and leaves) \\n\\nsandi: what\\'s the matter? \\n\\njerry: nothing. \\n\\nsandi: you\\'re acting weird. is anything wrong? \\n\\njerry: no. \\n\\nsandi: are you breaking up with me? \\n\\njerry: are we going out? \\n\\nsandi: you\\'re breaking up with me, aren\\'t you? (almost crying) \\n\\njerry: do you want me to break up with you? \\n\\nsandi: if that\\'s what you want. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t even know what you\\'re talking about. \\n\\nsandi: fine. break up with me. \\n\\njerry: all right. we\\'re broken up. \\n\\nsandi: (little pause) can we still be friends? (jerry raises his head, staring ahead and wondering what\\'s going on) \\n\\ngeorge: remember when you came to audition for us? \\n\\ntom: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: there was a box of raisins on the coffee table. did you, by any chance, take them with you when left? \\n\\ntom: what are you talking about? \\n\\ngeorge: well we were all eating the raisins. and i remember you--you were eating some of the raisins. and then you left, and the raisins were gone. and i was just wondering if, you know (chuckles), maybe you took them with you. \\n\\ntom: are you accusing me of stealing the raisins? \\n\\ngeorge: oh, no, no-- \\n\\ntom: (angry) why would i steal a box of raisins!? \\n\\ngeorge: no you wouldn\\'t. nobody would. it\\'s just that... they were missing, and... well i\\'m just inquiring. (chuckles nervously) \\n\\ntom: let me give you a word of advice. o.k.? i want you to stay away from me. i don\\'t wanna talk to you, and i don\\'t wanna hear anymore of your stupid little notes and suggestions. i don\\'t like you. so if you got any other problems whether it\\'s raisins, prunes, figs, or any other dried fruit, just keep it to yourself and stay out of my way, o.k.? \\n\\ngeorge: mm-hmm. mm-hmm. all right. i don\\'t think we\\'re gonna have any problem with that. (chuckles nervously) good talking to you tom. really. \\n\\nrussell: (nervously, almost desperately) elaine. elaine. what do you want? what can i do? is it my job? is that what it is? elaine i can\\'t go on like this. will you call me? would you call me? well, why? all right. may i call you? elaine? elaine?

(elaine drops her bag, takes off her jacket and walks into jerry\\'s bedroom) well, if we have to (un-tucks his shirt) we have to. \\n\\n[location: karen\\'s bedroom] \\n\\nkaren: mmmm, oh george, oooh. \\n\\ngeorge: please, it\\'s not necessary. \\n\\nkaren: mmm what\\'s not necessary? \\n\\ngeorge: the little extra moan you threw in there. laying it on a bit thick, don\\'t you think? \\n\\nkaren: what are you talking about? \\n\\ngeorge: what am i talking about? come on. (laughing) you don\\'t think i bought all that? (does a little move) \\n\\nkaren: what, what? \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'re very good. very good with the moanings and the gyrations. y-you really had me going there for a minute. \\n\\nkaren: you think i was faking? \\n\\ngeorge: come on \\'oh george, oh geeeooorge!\\' come on! not that i don\\'t appreciate the effort that was put into it. \\n\\nkaren: i\\'d like you to leave. \\n\\ngeorge: what? \\n\\nkaren: i said, i would like you to leave. come on, just get your clothes on and get out. \\n\\ngeorge: but why? \\n\\nkaren: because i said so. (pushes george off the bed) \\n\\ngeorge: i-i-i can\\'t find my glasses. \\n\\nkaren: well hurry up. \\n\\ngeorge: i need to look for my glasses. \\n\\nkaren: (seen through george eyes all blurry) get out! get out!! get out!!! \\n\\n[location: jerry\\'s bedroom] \\n\\njerry: it\\'s all george\\'s fault. all that talk about impotence. it got to me. and that orgasm stuff orgasm this and orgasm that. it\\'s a lot of pressure! \\n\\nelaine: you know i\\'m a little hungry. you wouldn\\'t happen to have any of that mango left? \\n\\nthe female orgasm is kinda like the bat cave, very few people know where it is and if you\\'re lucky enough to see it you probably don\\'t know how you got there and you can\\'t find you way back after you left. there are two types of female orgasms: the real and the fake. and uh i\\'ll tell you right now, as a man, we don\\'t know. we do not know, because to a man sex is like a car accident and determining the female orgasm is like being asked \\'what did you see after the car went out of control?\\'. \\'uh i heard a lot of screeching sounds, uh i remember i was facing the wrong way at one point. and in the end my body was thrown clear. \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\ngeorge: i can\\'t believe this. \\n\\njerry: oh, it won\\'t be for that long. \\n\\ngeorge: how can i do this? how can i move back in with those people? please, tell me. they\\'re insane. you know that. \\n\\njerry: hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents. \\n\\ngeorge: how can you compare you parents to my parents?! \\n\\njerry: my father has never thrown anything out. ever! \\n\\ngeorge: my father wears his sneakers in the pool! sneakers! \\n\\njerry: my mother has never set foot in a natural body of water. \\n\\ngeorge: (showing jerry up) listen carefully. my mother has never laughed. ever. not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.. never went \\'ha!\\' \\n\\njerry: a smirk? \\n\\ngeorge: maybe!.. and i\\'m moving back in there! \\n\\njerry: i told you i\\'d lend you the money for the rent. \\n\\ngeorge: no, no, no, no. borrowing money from a friend is like having sex. it just completely changes the relationship. \\n\\nkramer: alright. i\\'m ready. (to george) you know, i still don\\'t understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents? \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t want to! i\\'m outta money! i got 714 dollars left in the bank. \\n\\nkramer: well, move in here. \\n\\njerry: (stopping the notion) what\\'s that? \\n\\nkramer: why doesn\\'t he just move in here? \\n\\ngeorge: (sarcastic) yeah, yeah. i\\'m gonna move in with him. he doesn\\'t even let you use the toilet! \\n\\nkramer: you can move in with me, if you want. \\n\\ngeorge: (sincerely) thank you.. i, uh.. that might not work out. \\n\\n[setting: the costanza\\'s house] \\n\\nestelle: careful! careful with the suitcases! we just painted! \\n\\nkramer: hello, mrs. costanza. \\n\\njerry: (quietly) hello, mrs. costanza. \\n\\nestelle: (not really noticing jerry said hello) hello, kramer. close the door. \\n\\nkramer: well, i gotta bring in more stuff. (heads for the door) \\n\\nestelle: more stuff?! \\n\\nkramer: yeah. (exits) \\n\\nestelle: (to george) how much is there?! \\n\\ngeorge: (annoyed) there\\'s more. \\n\\nestelle: so, how are ya, jerry? \\n\\njerry: fine, mrs. costanza. (attempts to get estelle to laugh) hey, i got a terrific joke for you.. \\n\\nestelle: (sits down on the couch) nah, not interested. \\n\\njerry: no, no. it-it\\'s really funny. there\\'s these two guys- \\n\\nestelle: (interrupting) tell it to the audience. (george gives jerry an \\'i told you so\\' look) here, (picks up a plate full of sandwiches) i made some bologna sandwiches. \\n\\ngeorge: bologna?! no one eats bologna anymore! \\n\\nestelle: what are you talking about?! (to jerry) have a sandwich. \\n\\njerry: (setting down a box) no thanks. \\n\\nestelle: oh, stop it! you don\\'t want one, kramer? \\n\\nkramer: uhh.. no thanks. (goes back out the door) \\n\\nestelle: i think you\\'re all a little touched in the head. (puts the plate down) you\\'re so worried about your health.. you\\'re young men. \\n\\njerry: i really don\\'t eat it. \\n\\nestelle: what am i gonna do with all these sandwiches?! will you take them home? give them to someone in your building? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know if i\\'d feel comfortable handing out bologna sandwiches in the building.. \\n\\nkramer: (enters with a box) alright, that\\'s it. anything else? \\n\\ngeorge: (muttering) no, that\\'s it. \\n\\nkramer: oh, i gotta go move the car. alright (leaves) \\n\\njerry: well, i guess we\\'ll be going.. (heads for the door) \\n\\ngeorge: (runs over to him, not wanting him to leave) what? you\\'re going? \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: wha - what are you doing later? \\n\\njerry: oh, elaine and i are going out to dinner with kramer and his new girlfriend. \\n\\ngeorge: really? \\n\\njerry: yeah, you can\\'t believe this woman. she\\'s one of those low-talkers. you can\\'t hear a word she\\'s saying! you\\'re always going \\'excuse me?\\', \\'what was that?\\' \\n\\ngeorge: yeah.. may - maybe i\\'ll meet ya? \\n\\nestelle: no, george. we\\'re going out to eat tonight with your father. \\n\\ngeorge: (mutters) oh.. okay.. talk to you later. \\n\\njerry: yeah, take it easy. (leaves) \\n\\ngeorge: oh, my god.. (buries his face into his hands) \\n\\n[setting: a restaurant] \\n\\nelaine: okay, well, he had this idea of a pizza place where you make your own pie! (laughs) \\n\\njerry: right. \\n\\neliane: you remember that? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, well, that was a good one. \\n\\njerry: well.. \\n\\nelaine: what\\'s that? \\n\\njerry: excuse me? \\n\\njerry: yeah.. yeah. \\n\\nelaine: yep. yeah.. \\n\\nkramer: you know that, uh, leslie (points to her) is in the clothing business? she\\'s a designer. \\n\\nelaine: (interested) oh? \\n\\nkramer: in fact, she\\'s come up with a new one that is going to be the big new look in men\\'s fashion.. it\\'s a, a puffy shirt. (leslie mumbles to kramer) well, yeah, it - it\\'s all puffy. like the pirates used to wear. \\n\\nelaine: oh, a puffy shirt. \\n\\njerry: puffy. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, see, i think people want to look like pirates. you know, it\\'s the right time for it.. to be all puffy, and devil-may-care.. \\n\\nkramer: (still laughing) that\\'s true.. (gets up) i\\'ll be right back. (walks off laughing. jerry and elaine are left with the low-talker. a moment passes) \\n\\nelaine: uh, o... (remembers something they could talk about) jerry\\'s going to be on the \"today\" show on friday. \\n\\njerry: yeah, that\\'s right! \\n\\nelaine: yep.. yep. um, he\\'s promoting a (pauses) benefit for goodwill, you know, they, uh, they clothe the (clears her throat) poor, and the homeless.. \\n\\njerry: (points at elaine) and the indigent. \\n\\nelaine: and the indigent, yeah.. i, i do volunteer work for them. i-i set the whole thing up, and i got jerry to do it. \\n\\njerry: sure. \\n\\nelaine: ohh, yeah. yeah.. yep. \\n\\njerry: uh-huh. \\n\\nelaine: yep. \\n\\njerry: yep.. \\n\\nelaine: mmm \\n\\n[setting: a restaurant] \\n\\nestelle: maybe you should take a civil service test. \\n\\ngeorge: (studying the salt shaker) i\\'m not taking a civil service test. \\n\\nfrank: look at this, george. (takes a coin out of his pocket) you ever seen a silver dollar? \\n\\ngeorge: yes, i\\'ve seen a silver dollar. \\n\\nelaine: why don\\'t you want to take a civil service test? \\n\\ngeorge: to do what?! work in a post office? is that what you want me to do? \\n\\nfrank: would you believe when i was 18, i had a ssssilver dollar collection? \\n\\nestelle: i don\\'t understand. you get job security - you get a pay check every week.. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m a college graduate. you want me to be a mailman? \\n\\nfrank: (still looking at his coin) you know, i couldn\\'t bring myself to spend one of these. i got some kind of a-a-a-a-a phobia. \\n\\nestelle: so what are you gonna do?! \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t know. i do know that i have some kind of a talent - something to offer. i just don\\'t know what it is yet! \\n\\nfrank: i bet that collection would be worth a lot of money today. (does a form of magic trick making the coin disappear as he shows george an empty hand) \\n\\ngeorge: (looks fed up with his parents) oh my god.. \\n\\nfrank: i don\\'t like this waiter. (holds up his hand to get the waiters attention - starts snapping) look at him.. he sees us.. he doesn\\'t want to come over. \\n\\ngeorge: (needing to get away from his parents, he gets up) i need some air.. \\n\\nestelle: george, where are you going?! \\n\\ngeorge: (walks off) i got a lot of thinking to do. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, i\\'m sorry. i\\'m terribly sorry.. (bends down, and starts picking up her things) \\n\\nwoman: look at what you\\'ve done! you spilled my bag! \\n\\ngeorge: (stuttering) i, i, i, .. here, let me - let me help you.. \\n\\nwoman: no, no ,no. it\\'s all right. (begins helping him pick her things up) \\n\\ngeorge: it - it\\'s just that i\\'m here with my parents, and my mother wants me to take a civil service test - and to tell you the truth, i don\\'t even think i\\'d pass it.. so.. \\n\\nwoman: hmm.. \\n\\ngeorge: what? \\n\\nwoman: (looking at both his hands intensely) your hands. \\n\\ngeorge: what about them? \\n\\nwoman: they\\'re quite exquisite! \\n\\ngeorge: they are? \\n\\nwoman: (mesmerized) extraordinary! have you ever done any hand modeling? \\n\\ngeorge: hand modeling? (shakes his head \\'no\\') \\n\\nwoman: (fishes a card out of her purse, then hands it to george) here\\'s my card. why don\\'t you, uh, give me a call? (walks off) \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\njerry: (shrugs) i - i don\\'t get it. \\n\\ngeorge: me neither! \\n\\njerry: what is it? \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t know. \\n\\njerry: they\\'re hands! \\n\\ngeorge: this woman just set me up for a job! \\n\\njerry: (gets up, and displays his own hands) well, what about my hands? i don\\'t see how your hands are any better than my hands. \\n\\ngeorge: what, are you kidding? (points at the flaws of jerry\\'s hands) the knuckles are all out of proportion. you got hair over there - where do you get off comparing your hands to my hands?! this is a one-in-a-million hand. (points to his own hand) \\n\\njerry: well, that\\'s what comes from avoiding manual labor your whole life. \\n\\ngeorge: this is it! it happened to me, jerry! i was sitting in the restaurant, the two nut jobs were talking - i couldn\\'t take it any more. i got up, and (makes a noise) i bop into this woman.. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s just like in the movies. \\n\\nkramer: hey. (he\\'s carrying a suit cover. he hangs it on jerry\\'s coat hooks) \\n\\njerry: hey. \\n\\nkramer: hey, george! (holds out his hand. george shakes it - a hand buzzer goes off. george starts freaking out. kramer laughs) \\n\\ngeorge: oh!!!! what are you, crazy?! are you, crazy?! \\n\\nkramer: what?! \\n\\ngeorge: you coulda damaged my hand! \\n\\nkramer: (laughing) but, it\\'s only a toy! \\n\\njerry: (explaining) george has become a hand model. \\n\\nkramer: a hand model? \\n\\njerry: yes. \\n\\nkramer: (to george) really? let me see your hands. \\n\\ngeorge: (defensively) you can look at them, but do not touch them. (holds them out) \\n\\nkramer: let\\'s see.. (studies them) oh, those are nice. you know, i\\'ve never noticed this before? they\\'re smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet (turns to jerry) masculine. \\n\\ngeorge: (takes two oven mitts from his back pack) alright, (puts them on) i gotta get going. \\n\\njerry: oven mitts? \\n\\ngeorge: (embarrassed) that\\'s all i could find. (a moment passes) would you mind getting the door? \\n\\nkramer: yeah.. \\n\\njerry: alright. (jerry opens the door for george) \\n\\ngeorge: thank you very much. (walks out) \\n\\nkramer: you\\'re not going to believe what happening with leslie. you know, ever since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on the today show, she\\'s been getting all these orders from boutiques and department stores.. \\n\\njerry: uh-huh.. (finally realizes what kramer said, he looks up) since i said what? \\n\\nkramer: agreed to wear the puffy shirt. (starts unzipping the suit cover) \\n\\njerry: what are you talking about? \\n\\nkramer: when you said that you\\'d agree to wear the puffy shirt on the today show. (takes the ridiculous puffy shirt out of the cover) \\n\\njerry: (goes up to it) this? \\n\\nkramer: yea. \\n\\njerry: i agreed to wear this?! \\n\\nkramer: yeah, yeah. \\n\\njerry: but, when did i do that? \\n\\nkramer: when we went to dinner the other night. \\n\\njerry: what are you, crazy?! \\n\\nkramer: what were you talking about when i went to the bathroom? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know! i couldn\\'t understand a word she was saying! i was just nodding! \\n\\nkramer: (makes his pop sound) there you go. \\n\\njerry: where i go? you mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt on national tv, and i said \\'yes\\'?! \\n\\nkramer: yes, yes! you said it! \\n\\njerry: but, i - i didn\\'t know what she was talking about. i couldn\\'t hear her! \\n\\nkramer: (takes it off the hook, and starts walking toward jerry with it. he backs defensively backs away from it) well, she asked you. \\n\\njerry: i - i can\\'t wear this puffy shirt on tv! i mean, look at it! it looks ridiculous! \\n\\nkramer: well, you gotta wear it now! all those stores are stocking it based on the condition that you\\'re gonna wear this on the tv show! the factory in new jersey is already makin\\' em. \\n\\njerry: they\\'re making these? \\n\\nkramer: yes, yes. this pirate trend that she\\'s come up with, jerry, this-this is gonna be the new look for the 90\\'s. you\\'re gonna be the first pirate! \\n\\njerry: (like a little kid) but, i don\\'t want to be a pirate! \\n\\n[setting: the costanza house] \\n\\nestelle: i knew it. i knew it.. i always knew you always had beautiful hands. i used to tell people. frank, didn\\'t i use to talk about his hands? \\n\\nfrank: (looking up from his paper) who the hell did\\'ya ever mention his hands to? \\n\\nestelle: (getting annoyed) i mentioned his hands to plenty of people! \\n\\nfrank: you never mentioned them to me! \\n\\ngeorge: (snaps, then points to the coffee table) hand me an emory board. \\n\\nestelle: i always talk about your hands - how they\\'re so soft and milky white.. \\n\\nfrank: no! you never said milky white! \\n\\nestelle: (getting angry) i said milky white! \\n\\ngeorge: (to estelle) scissor. (she gets the scissors from the coffee table and hands them to george with the point facing him) don\\'t hand them to me with the point facing out! \\n\\nestelle: i\\'m sorry. \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'re sorry?! \\n\\nestelle: (apologizing) i\\'ll try to be more careful. \\n\\ngeorge: (stern, angered) i hope so. (takes the scissors) \\n\\nestelle: georgie.. (nudges george\\'s arm, disrupting his work with the scissors) oh, georgie, would you like some jell-o? \\n\\nfrank: (to estelle, referring to the jell-o) why\\'d you put the bananas in there?! \\n\\nestelle: (yelling) george likes the bananas! \\n\\nfrank: (trying to match her tone) so let him have bananas on the side! \\n\\ngeorge: alright! please, please! i cannot have this constant bickering!.. stress is very damaging to the epidermis! now, i have an important photo session in the morning - my hands have got to be in tip-top shape, so please - keep the television down, and the conversation to a minimum. \\n\\nestelle: (meek) but georgie.. what about the jell-o? \\n\\ngeorge: (definite) i\\'ll take it in my room.

(stagehand leaves) jerry! five minutes! \\n\\nkramer: now that\\'s a great looking shirt! (gets up, admiring the shirt) aye captain! (growls like a pirate) yeah! i\\'m glad i ironed it. it\\'s perfect. (walks around jerry, inspecting the shirt) look at it! it\\'s fantastic! \\n\\njerry: (resisting) kramer, how am i gonna wear this?! i-i can\\'t wear this! \\n\\nkramer: (reassuring) hey, this look\\'s better than anything you own. you know, in two months time, everybody\\'s gonna be wearing the (imitates a pirate) pirate look! \\n\\nkramer: yeah. \\n\\nelaine: hi, kramer. guess what - i just saw bryant gumbel, he said he might help out at the benefit! \\n\\nkramer: great. \\n\\nelaine: (between laughs) what is that?! \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s the puffy shirt. look at it, eh? whatd\\'ya think? is it cool or what? \\n\\nelaine: (to jerry) why\\'re you wearing that now? \\n\\njerry: (obviously mad at the situation he\\'s in) \\'why am i wearing is now?? i\\'ll tell you why i\\'m wearing it now - because the lowtalker asked me to, that\\'s why! and i said \\'yes\\'. do you know why? because i couldn\\'t hear her! \\n\\nelaine: when did she, (snickers) when did she ask you this? \\n\\njerry: when we were at dinner, when kramer went to the bathroom. \\n\\nelaine: i didn\\'t hear anything. \\n\\njerry: (yelling out) of course not! nobody hears anything when this woman speaks! \\n\\nelaine: (just now making the matter serious) well, you can\\'t wear that on the show. \\n\\nkramer: (to elaine, muffled, low, and threatening) elaine, you want to stop? \\n\\nelaine: (turning around to kramer) wha- what? no. (back to jerry) jerry, you are promoting a benefit to clothe homeless people. you can\\'t come out dressed like that! you\\'re all puffed up!.. you look like the count of monte cristo! \\n\\njerry: (arms out, complaining) i have to wear it! the woman has orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on tv.. they\\'re producing them as we speak! \\n\\nelaine: (arguing) yeah, but you\\'re supposed to be a compassionate person! that cares about poor people! you look like you\\'re gonna.. swing in on a chandelier! \\n\\nstagehand: (looking down at a clipboard, enters) okay, let\\'s go. (looks up, points at jerry\\'s puffy shirt) is that what you\\'re wearing? \\n\\n[setting: a photographer\\'s studio] \\n\\nman: i\\'ve never seen hands like these before.. \\n\\nwoman: they\\'re so soft and milky white. \\n\\nphotographer: you know who\\'s hands they remind me of? (pauses for effect) ray mckigney. \\n\\nman: ugh.. ray. \\n\\nphotographer: he was it. \\n\\ngeorge: who was he? \\n\\nphotographer: the most exquisite hands you\\'ve ever seen.. oh, he had it all. \\n\\ngeorge: (hands still out, even though they\\'ve stopped looking at them) what happened to him? \\n\\nman: (clears throat) tragic story, i\\'m afraid. he could\\'ve had any woman in the world.. but none could match the beauty of his own hand.. and that became his one true love.. \\n\\ngeorge: you mean, uh..? \\n\\nman: yes. he was not.. master of his domain. \\n\\ngeorge: (makes a gesture saying he understands. the man nods) but how.. uh..? \\n\\nman: (quick, to the point) the muscles.. became so strained with.. overuse, that eventually the hand locked into a deformed position, and he was left with nothing but a claw. (holds hand up, displaying a claw-like shape) he traveled the world seeking a cure.. acupuncturists.. herbalists.. swamis.. nothing helped. towards the end, his hands became so frozen the was unable to manipulate utensils, (visibly disgusted by this last part) and was dependent on cub scouts to feed him. i hadn\\'t seen another pair of hands like ray mckigney\\'s until today. you are his successor. (george looks down at his hands) i uh only hope you have a little more self-control. \\n\\ngeorge: (smiling to himself) you don\\'t have to worry about me. (nodding, gloating) i won a contest. \\n\\nphotographer: ok, let\\'s get to work. \\n\\n[setting: the today show] \\n\\nbryant: (talking directly to the camera) back now, 746. on tuesday the 19th here in new york there will be a benefit for the goodwill industries - a used clothing organization that provides services to the needy. one of the performers will be comedian jerry seinfeld. (turns to face jerry) jerry, good morning. \\n\\njerry: (mumbling out) thank you, bryant. \\n\\nbryant: (pointing out) and speaking of clothing, that is a very, very unusual shirt you have on. \\n\\njerry: (looking down at the shirt; mumbling) oh, thank you. \\n\\nbryant: you\\'re all kinda, (waves his hands around) kinda \"puffed up\". (chuckles) \\n\\njerry: yeah, it\\'s a puffy shirt. \\n\\nbryant: (laughing) you look kinda like a pirate. \\n\\njerry: (nervous laughter) yeah.. like a pirate.. (attempting to get on another subject) anyway, ah, you know, we\\'re hoping to, um, raise enough money.. with this.. uh.. \\n\\nbryant: (rudely interrupting, still snickering at the shirt) you.. ah, look, i\\'m sorry, it is just a very unusual shirt. it could be kind of a whole new look for you.. you know, you could put a patch over an eye, you could be kind of like the pirate-comedian. \\n\\njerry: uh-huh, yeah. (smiling, nodding, clearly wanting bryant to shut up) \\n\\nbryant: are you going to be wearing the shirt at the concert? \\n\\njerry: (losing it, mad) look, it\\'s not my shirt. \\n\\nbryant: (confused) whose shirt is it? \\n\\njerry: what\\'s the difference? i agreed to wear it. it\\'s - it\\'s a puffy shirt. i feel ridiculous in it, and i think it\\'s the stupidest shirt i\\'ve ever seen, to be perfectly honest with you. (nodding) \\n\\nleslie: (off camera, shrill, high pitched yelling) you bastard! \\n\\nbryant: (to jerry) did you hear that? \\n\\njerry: (pointing off screen, nodding) that i heard. \\n\\n[setting: photographer\\'s studio] \\n\\nphotographer: (instructing george) alright, a little to the left.. little higher, little higher. good. perfect! perfect. \\n\\ngeorge: like that? \\n\\nphotographer: just like that. hold it. (takes picture) good, ok, let me get just one more, one more. (takes another picture) good, that\\'s it. you\\'re done. \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s it? \\n\\nphotographer: (smiling) that\\'s it. \\n\\nman: (pulling a slip of paper out of his coat pocket) and here\\'s your check. (george accepts) thank you very much. (pats him on the back) it was an honor. \\n\\nwoman: it was great working with you. (somewhat coy) your hands are beautiful. \\n\\ngeorge: (modest) oh, thank you very much. (chuckles) \\n\\nwoman: you know, i was wondering - if you\\'re not doing anything later, maybe you\\'d like to get together..? \\n\\n[setting: park] \\n\\n[setting: today show dressing room] \\n\\nleslie: you ruined me! you ruined my career! \\n\\njerry: oh, just keep your voice down. everyone can hear you. \\n\\nleslie: (shouting out) oh, i don\\'t give a damn! \\n\\njerry: (reasoning) you know, if you talked this loud to begin with, i wouldn\\'t be in this costume in the first place! \\n\\ngeorge: (quick, excited talking) hey, hey! you can\\'t believe this. look at this check! (hands it to jerry) they told me i had the most beautiful hands they\\'d ever seen in their lives - except for this mckigney guy - this great looking girl gave me her phone number.. i got it! i got it all! i\\'m busting. jerry, i\\'m busting! \\n\\nelaine: hey, i\\'ve never noticed your hands before. let me see. \\n\\ngeorge: alright. (holds them up) \\n\\nelaine: (obviously not impressed, dull) yeah, real nice. \\n\\ngeorge: (turning back to jerry, he takes the check back. he just now notices the shirt jerry\\'s wearing, and snickers, pointing) nice shirt.. (laughs, jerry shrugs) what is this? is this what you wore on the show? \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: what, have you completely lost your mind? \\n\\nkramer: (faint, trying to shut george up) hey.. \\n\\ngeorge: who\\'s dressing you? (laughs) you look like a complete idiot! you know, i wouldn\\'t wipe my- (unable to take anymore, leslie gets up and shoves george violently. his hands go straight for the hot iron sitting on the dressing room table. george screams out in agony) aahhhh!!!!! (his voice is heard outside the building, on the street, and in the park were a bunch of pigeons are scared by the yelling) \\n\\n[setting: a restaurant] \\n\\nelaine: you ready? \\n\\ngeorge: ow! hot! hot! \\n\\nelaine: (sincere) i\\'m sorry. \\n\\ngeorge: (reflecting on his life gone wrong) this mckigney guy had a few good years.. (to kramer, bitter) how could you forget to turn off an iron? \\n\\nkramer: well, i was excited because jerry was putting on the puffy shirt. \\n\\ngeorge: my whole life is ruined because of the (mocking, bitter tone) \"puffy shirt\". \\n\\njerry: (pointing out) it didn\\'t do me any good either! that benefit was the worst show i ever did. some of those heckles were really uncalled for \"avast ye matey\" - what the hell does that mean?! \"20 degrees off the starboard side - the spanish galleon!\" - there\\'s no comeback for that! \\n\\nelaine: (reflecting) well, it got me fired from the benefit committee. \\n\\nkramer: you know all those stores canceled out on her? she\\'s finished. (concluding) we\\'re (leslie and him) finished. \\n\\njerry: really? what happened? \\n\\nkramer: (showing pure irony) i just can\\'t be with someone who\\'s life is in complete disarray. \\n\\njerry: what happened with all the shirts? \\n\\nkramer: they gave them all to goodwill. \\n\\nhomeless man: ahh, can you spare a little change for an old buccaneer? \\n\\njerry: (while digging in his pocket for some money, he looks over the shirts one last time) you know, it\\'s really not a bad looking shirt.. \\n\\nelaine: do you ever spit on anybody from here? \\n\\njerry: no. you? \\n\\nelaine: no. do you ever think about it? \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\nelaine: me too. \\n\\nkramer: hey. \\n\\njerry: hey. \\n\\nkramer: well i got it! \\n\\njerry: you got me the air conditioner? \\n\\nkramer: what do you think? \\n\\njerry: beautiful! \\n\\nelaine: what air conditioner? \\n\\nkramer: well my buddy works in an appliance store and he got us thirty percent off. \\n\\njerry: is it a good one? \\n\\nkramer: good one? it\\'s the commando 8. \\n\\njerry: commando 8? \\n\\nkramer: 12,000 btu\\'s. \\n\\nelaine: i thought you hated air conditioning. you\\'ve never had an air conditioner. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, but amy likes air conditioning. \\n\\nelaine: oooh, you\\'re getting an air conditioner for amy. (in a wining voice) amy doesn\\'t like the temperature up here. she\\'s a little hoooot. \\n\\njerry: all right. \\n\\nkramer: okay, so, i\\'m gonna measure the window up, okay buddy? \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\nkramer: yeah. (george enters the apartment wearing goggles) yeah, rock on! \\n\\ngeorge: i gotta get out of this city. \\n\\njerry: so you\\'re tunneling to the center of the earth? (elaine laughs silently) \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m at the health club and while i\\'m in the pool, some guy walks off with my glasses. who steals prescription glasses? \\n\\nelaine: you don\\'t have an old pair? \\n\\ngeorge: i broke \\'em playing basketball. \\n\\njerry: he was running from a bee. (elaine laughs) \\n\\ngeorge: now if i wanna see anything i gotta wear these. \\n\\nelaine: george, those are prescription goggles? what is there to see in a health club pool? \\n\\njerry: there\\'s a lot of change down there. \\n\\ngeorge: when i find that guy, this much i vow those glasses will be returned to their rightful owner. \\n\\njerry: we\\'re behind you, aquaboy. godspeed! \\n\\ngeorge: what kind of a sick, demented person wants another person\\'s glasses? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, especially those frames. \\n\\nkramer: you know what you ought to do? go see my friend dwayne at j & t optical on columbus avenue. he\\'ll give you thirty percent off. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, come on. \\n\\njerry: hey, he just got me thirty percent off on an air conditioner. \\n\\ngeorge: really? \\n\\nkramer: retail is for suckers. \\n\\ngeorge: wow. uh, what do i have to do? \\n\\nkramer: you just gotta mention my name. \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s it? \\n\\nkramer: that\\'s it. (smacks george on the forehead with a ruler) \\n\\ngeorge: what about these? \\n\\nelaine: they look good. i liked the other one too. i\\'ve liked about five of them. \\n\\ngeorge: well, it\\'s a tough decision. i have to wear these every day. i\\'m deciding on a new face. \\n\\njerry: (bored) come on, george. pick a face and go with it. \\n\\nelaine: now those look good, they\\'re very bold. \\n\\ngeorge: yes, they are bold. jerry, what do you think? \\n\\njerry: (while looking at posters of women wearing glasses) i think these women would be pretty good looking if they weren\\'t wearing glasses. \\n\\nelaine: hi there, little doggy. (to owner) do you mind if i pet your dog? \\n\\ndog owner: it\\'s okay with me. \\n\\nelaine: hey little doggy. (elaine pets the dog and he bites her) aaah! \\n\\ndwayne: hey, you can\\'t have that dog in here. \\n\\njerry: are you okay? did he bite ya? \\n\\ngeorge: can you believe that guy? \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m okay, it\\'s just a nip. \\n\\ngeorge: he just walked away! and once again i\\'m standing here like a little man. well not this time! (george leaves the store and follows the dog owner) you! dog man! \\n\\nelaine: my leg looks pretty bad. \\n\\njerry: oh i\\'m gonna take you over to the emergency room. \\n\\nelaine: okay. \\n\\njerry: (to george) hey, any luck? did you catch \\'em? \\n\\ngeorge: uuh, no, no. \\n\\njerry: all right, i\\'m gonna take elaine over to the hospital. \\n\\ngeorge: (in a really strange way) good, good, do that. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s the matter? \\n\\ngeorge: oh, no, nothing. \\n\\njerry: what is it? \\n\\ngeorge: i can\\'t tell you. \\n\\nelaine: (pulling on jerry\\'s pants from the ground) jerry, can we go? \\n\\njerry: yeah, yeah, in a second, in a second.

\\n\\nelaine: that\\'s that\\'s correct, i-i felt that the character doesn\\'t like to be ch-ch-chilly... \\n\\nlippman: i see, (reads another excerpt) \"i pulled the lever on the machine, but the clark bar didn\\'t come out!\" exclamation point? \\n\\nelaine: well, yeah, you know how frustrating that can be when you keep putting quarters and quarters in to machine and then (prrt) nothing comes out... \\n\\nlippman: get rid of the exclamation points... \\n\\nelaine: ok, ok ok ... \\n\\nlippman: i hate exclamation points... \\n\\nelaine: ...ok i\\'ll just.... \\n\\njerry: \\'dear barry. consider this letter to be official termination of our relationship effective immediately.\\' \\n\\nkramer: exclamation point. \\n\\nelaine: you still have no proof. \\n\\nkramer: elaine, he was sniffing like crazy around me. \\n\\njerry: \\'i will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later than the 18th\\'. \\n\\nkramer: double exclamation point! \\n\\nnewman: will that take care of ours too?

(starts doing a little dance) i am on a roll. i\\'m just willing these great parking spots. \\n\\njerry: george... \\n\\ngeorge: maybe the baby would like to see my spot. a positive, uplifting message to start his life out with. huh, you can still get a great space in this city - if you apply yourself. \\n\\njerry: (to elaine) where\\'s kramer? shouldn\\'t he be here by now. \\n\\nelaine: did you give him the room number? \\n\\njerry: ya, 1397. \\n\\nkramer: 1937, 1937, 1937... \\n\\npatient: excuse me. do you know where the elevator is? \\n\\nkramer: uh ya, it\\'s right around the corner there. \\n\\nkramer: 1937. \\n\\nkramer: oh! god, it\\'s a pig man! a pig man! \\n\\nstan: ..so anyway, jerry, elaine, we have something we want to ask you. \\n\\ngeorge: you gotta look at this. i pulled it in perfectly equidistant from the car in front of me and the car behind me. \\n\\njerry: will you shut up george. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m taking a cab home. i can\\'t this anymore. \\n\\njerry: you were saying stan? i-i\\'m sorry about that. \\n\\nstan: myra and i would like you and elaine to be the godparents of steven. \\n\\nelaine: huuh, wow. \\n\\njerry: me? godfather? \\n\\nstan: yes. \\n\\njerry: (a la \"don corleone\") never go against the family, elaine. \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\nkramer: hey, i just saw a pig man! a pig man! ya know he was sleeping and then he woke up and he looked up at me an-and he made this horrible sound, this (quells like a pig). \\n\\ngeorge: kramer, what the hell are you talking about? \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m talking about the pig man. i went into the wrong room and there he was. \\n\\ngeorge: a pig-man? \\n\\nkramer: a pig-man. half pig, half man! \\n\\nelaine: that\\'s great kramer... so-so, anyway, tell us what\\'s involved in being a godparent. \\n\\njerry: (a la \"don corleione\") elaine, never ask me about my business!.... (sheepish) \"godfather.\" \\n\\nstan: the most important thing is you help with the bris. \\n\\njerry: the bris? \\n\\nkramer: a bris? you mean circumcision? \\n\\nstan: ya. \\n\\nkramer: i would advise against that. \\n\\nelaine: wha, kramer. it\\'s a tradition. \\n\\nkramer: ya well, so was uh sacrificing virgins to appease the gods, but we don\\'t do that anymore. \\n\\njerry: well, maybe we should. \\n\\ngeorge: (knocks on the window) hey, why are all those people milling around my car? \\n\\nkramer: i don\\'t know. \\n\\njerry: maybe they\\'re admiring your spot. \\n\\nkramer: they\\'re all looking up. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, there\\'s a guy up the roof. \\n\\nkramer: whoa. that\\'s the guy that i told where the elevator was. \\n\\ngeorge: oh well, i hope he doesn\\'t jum... \\n\\ngeorge, elaine, kramer, jerry, & stan: oh my! \\n\\ngeorge: my car! my caaaaarrrr! \\n\\nelaine: a mohel! what the hell is a mohel? \\n\\njerry: a mohel is the person that performs the circumcision. \\n\\nelaine: where am i going to find a mohel? (looking through the yellow pages, muttering) motels, models... how do you find a mohel? \\n\\njerry: oh, finding a mohel is a piece of cake. any idiot can find a mohel. i have to hold the baby while they do it. that\\'s a tough job. how would you like that? \\n\\nelaine: hey jerry, you ever seen one? \\n\\njerry: you mean that wasn\\'t uh. \\n\\nelaine: yeah. \\n\\njerry: no.. you? \\n\\nelaine: ya. \\n\\njerry: what\\'d you think? \\n\\nelaine: (shakes her head) no, had no face, no personality. it was like a martian. but hey, you know that\\'s me. \\n\\njerry: hey. \\n\\ngeorge: well i just got the estimate. it\\'s going to cost more to fix that roof than the car\\'s worth, so i\\'m going over to see that hospital administrator today. someone is gonna pay for this damage and it\\'s not gonna be me. \\n\\njerry: ah, you\\'re screwed. \\n\\ngeorge: i know, swan dives from twenty floors up, lands right on top. what do i got a bulls eye up there? he couldn\\'t move over two feet? land on the sidewalk. it\\'s city property. \\n\\nelaine: well i have to interview a mohel. \\n\\njerry: how about our little elaine huh? attended the finest finishing schools on the eastern seaboard. equestrian competitions. debutante balls. look at her now. interviewing mohels. \\n\\nkramer: yea! \\n\\njerry: what\\'s the matter? \\n\\nelaine: are you alright? \\n\\nkramer: don\\'t even question my instincts, because my instincts are honed. (repaper) look at that. \\n\\njerry: what now? \\n\\nkramer: look look. \\n\\njerry: (kramer shows jerry and elaine the paper) \"hospital receives grant to conduct dna research\"..\" government funds genetic research at area hospital\" ... yeah, so? \\n\\nkramer: pig-man, baby. pig-man. \\n\\nelaine: if i hear about this pig-man one more time... \\n\\nkramer: hey, i\\'m tellin ya the pig-man is alive. the government has been experimenting with pig-men since the fifties. \\n\\njerry: oh, will you stop it. just because a hospital studying dna research doesn\\'t mean they\\'re creating a race of mutant pig-men! \\n\\nkramer: jerry wake up to reality. it\\'s a military thing. they\\'re probably creating a whole army of pig warriors. \\n\\ngeorge: i tell you something. i wish there were pig-men. you get a few of these pig-men walking around suddenly i\\'m looking a whole lot better. then if somebody wants to fix me up at least they could say, \"hey he\\'s no pig-man!\" \\n\\njerry: believe me, there\\'d be plenty of women going for these pig-men. whatever the deformity is there\\'s always some group of perverts that\\'s attracted to it. \"oo that little tail really turns me on.\" \\n\\nelaine: (mumbles) that\\'s just about enough \\n\\njerry: oh, what\\'s the matter this doesn\\'t interest you? \\n\\nelaine: oh, no, it\\'s fascinating, but could you do me a favor, could ya tape the rest of the pig-men and the women who love them discussion and i\\'ll listen to it the next time i\\'m here. i\\'ve gotta go find a mohel. \\n\\nkramer: you know, you should call this off, elaine. it\\'s a barbaric ritual. \\n\\nelaine: well, perhaps one day when the pig-men roam free it will be stopped kramer. until then, off with their heads. \\n\\ngeorge: but kramer, isn\\'t it a question of hygiene? \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s a myth. besides, it makes sex more pleasurable. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. so how does that help me? \\n\\njerry: (to george) hey george, you ever see one? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, my roommate in college. \\n\\njerry: so what\\'d you think? \\n\\ngeorge: (thinks for a second) i got used to it. \\n\\njerry: alright, i\\'m waiting. i-i want to see the pig-man. show me the pig- man. \\n\\nkramer: oh, don\\'t worry. i\\'m gonna show you, and you\\'ll never be the same. \\n\\njerry: maybe he\\'s just a guy with a nose like this. (holds his nose up like a pig) you know a lot of people have a nose like this, they\\'re not necessarily pig-men. \\n\\nkramer: believe me, jerry, somewhere in this hospital the anguished \"oink\" of pig-man cries out for help. \\n\\njerry: well, if i hear an anguished \"oink\", i\\'m outta here. i-i don\\'t see any pig-men. look (he points at passerby) human, human, human... (he looks down corridor, with alarm.) (with mock alarm) wait a second! (grabs kramer) \\n\\nkramer: what?! \\n\\njerry: oh, it\\'s george. \\n\\ngeorge: alright the administrator\\'s on the third floor. i\\'ll meet you guys back at the car. \\n\\nkramer: wait wait george. you got room in the car for the pig-man huh? \\n\\ngeorge: the pig-man can take the bus. \\n\\nkramer: george, if the pig-man had a car, he would give you a ride. \\n\\ngeorge: how do you know? what if pig-man had a two-seater? \\n\\nkramer: be realistic george. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'ll tell you what, if pig-man shows up, we\\'ll squeeze him in. i\\'ll see you later. \\n\\nkramer: yea. \\n\\nmrs. sweedler: mr. costanza, come in, come in. it\\'s been a very trying couple of days around the hospital. doctors, patients, everyone, just grief stricken over this unfortunate occurrence. \\n\\ngeorge: well, i join them in their grief. \\n\\nmrs. sweedler: horrible thing. flew right past the children\\'s wing. all the sick children, in the playroom, looking out the window, just traumatized by the incident. apparently, they thought he was flying. you know how children are, \"oh look. a man is flying. a man is flying\" and then, splat... \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s where i come in. umm, on splat. uh, you see, mrs. sweedler, or is it hospital administrator sweedler? \\n\\nmrs. sweedler: mrs. sweedler\\'s fine. \\n\\ngeorge: mrs. sweedler thank you. y-you see, this tragedy affected me in a very, very personal way. \\n\\nmrs. sweedler: how is that? \\n\\ngeorge: yes, well you see, the deceased landed on my car. the uh splat, as it were, actually occurred on the roof of my car. now of course i can\\'t help but feel that had it been a convertible this whole tragedy might have been averted but i\\'ve never been the kind of guy to buy a convertible, what with the baldness and everything. \\n\\nmrs. sweedler: well i have known bald men who owned convertibles. they wore a hat. \\n\\ngeorge: yes but then everything is all pulled down and it\\'s jus.. anyway. the damage, unfortunately, has marred an otherwise fine automobile, rendering it virtually undriveable. \\n\\nmrs. sweedler: (stiffening) yes, well, that is a shame. \\n\\ngeorge: yes, a shame. that is exactly how i would put it. now mrs. sweedler, with all due discretion and sensitivity, and taking in the whole scope of the situation, i just can\\'t help but think that, the hospital is somehow responsible for compensating the other, still living \\'victim\\' of horrendous, horrendous tragedy. \\n\\nmrs. sweedler: mr.constanza. \\n\\ngeorge: yes. \\n\\nmrs. sweedler: a man plummeted tragically to his ultimate demise - \\n\\ngeorge: yes. \\n\\nmrs. sweedler: ... and you greedily, callously want to profit from it? \\n\\ngeorge: (pulling out estimate out of his pocket) well, profit. i think you\\'ll see from the estimate that i\\'m not really profiting that much. they might be a little high, but.. \\n\\nmrs. sweedler: get out! get out, now! get out of my office. \\n\\ngeorge: should i leave this..? \\n\\nmrs. sweedler: get out! \\n\\nkramer: excuse me. what happened to the man, that was in this room before? \\n\\nresident: i don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about. \\n\\nkramer: you know. (he pushes his nose up with his thumb). \\n\\nresident: no. \\n\\nkramer: (still holding his nose up ) this doesn\\'t look familiar to you? \\n\\nresident: uh, sir? \\n\\nkramer: look, i know what\\'s going on. the oink, oink. \\n\\nresident: yes well if you\\'ll excuse me. i really have some patients i have to attend to. \\n\\nkramer: (tough talking) now listen to me you little quack, there was a half man, half pig in that room over there. now where is he?! where is he?! \\n\\nresident: half-what? \\n\\nkramer: you know what i mean - pork, sausage, (a la porky pig) a-deek-a-deek-a- deek th-th-th-that\\'s all folks. \\n\\nresident: i think he\\'s been released. \\n\\nkramer: he\\'s lying. \\n\\njerry: alright kramer, enough of this. let\\'s go find george. \\n\\nkramer: alright you go ahead. \\n\\njerry: kramer. \\n\\njerry: where\\'s the mohel? \\n\\nelaine: he\\'ll be here. \\n\\njerry: he\\'s late already. \\n\\nelaine: relax. you\\'d think you were getting whacked. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know why he asked me to be the godfather. we\\'re not even that close of friends. just cause we\\'re on the softball team, i\\'m the pitcher, he\\'s the catcher he thinks we have a special relationship? \\n\\nelaine: i thought pitchers and catchers did have a special rapport. \\n\\njerry: well maybe in hardball with all the signals and everything but i\\'m just lobbing it in. we don\\'t have any conferences. he doesn\\'t come out to the mound and encourage me. \\n\\nelaine: what about me? i mean i just watched a few games with her sitting in the stands. \\n\\njerry: don\\'t they have any closer friends. they\\'re level jumping on our friendship. \\n\\nelaine: yes it is level jumping. \\n\\ngeorge: so uh... been to a bris before? \\n\\nwoman: no. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'ve been to a few of em. if you uh start to get woozy later, which is quite common, stay close to me. i\\'ll get you through it. (chuckles) \\n\\nwoman: i\\'m a cardiologist. i think i\\'ll manage. \\n\\ngeorge: oh. \\n\\nkramer: we\\'re not talking about a manicure. imagine, this is going to be his first memory. of his parents just standing there while some stranger (does some motions of cutting; myra sobs more) cutting off a piece of his manhood and then serves a catered lunch. \\n\\nstan: (seeing myra run away sobbing) myra? \\n\\nelaine: kramer, what\\'s the matter with you? \\n\\nkramer: me? \\n\\nelaine: (to everyone) oh, that\\'s the mohel. \\n\\nall: (adlib) it\\'s the mohel! the mohel is here! thank god, the mohel is here. \\n\\nelaine: hello. \\n\\nmohel: (to elaine) hello, hello (shaking hands with jerry) hello, i\\'m the mohel. \\n\\njerry: hello. \\n\\nmohel: (cont\\'d) (shakes stan\\'s hand) it\\'s very nice to meet you all... (a pan clangs to the ground. the mohel snaps.) oh! what was that?!? jeez. scared the hell out of me. my god. i almost had a heart attack! (the crowd grows uneasy) (calming down) ok, i\\'m fine, i\\'m fine. anyway, we\\'re here to perform the mitzvah of the bris... (the baby starts crying) (with increasing tension) ...is the baby gonna cry like that? is that how the baby cries, with the loud, sustained, squealing cry, \\'cause that could pose a problem. do you have any control of your child \\'cause this will be the time to exercise it when baby is crying in that high-pitched, squealing tone that can drive you insane!!! \\n\\nelaine: did you find the place alright? \\n\\nmohel: did i find it alright? could you send me to a more dangerous neighborhood? i\\'m dreading walking back to the subway, someone shouldn\\'t crack me over the head and steal my bag, because i\\'ll be lying there and people will spit on me and empty my pockets. i\\'ll be lying in the gutter like a bum, like a dog, like a mutt, like a mongrel, like an animal! god forbid anybody should help me or call an ambulance. oh no, that\\'s too much trouble to pick up a phone and press a few buttons. ahh! what\\'s the point. \\n\\nelaine: (setting down her glass) oh, ya haha. \\n\\nmohel: (to elaine interrupting) darling, you see where that glass is? how that glass is near the edge of the table. you got the whole table there to put the glass, why you chose the absolute edge, so half the glass is hanging off the table, you breath and that glass falls over, then you\\'re gonna have broken glass on the carpet, embedded in the carpet fibers, deep, deep in the shag, broken glass, bits of broken glass that you never get out. you can\\'t get it out with a vacuum cleaner. even on your hands and knees with a magnifying glass, you can\\'t get all the pieces, and then you think you got it all and two years later, you\\'re walkin\\' barefoot and you step on a piece of broken glass and you kill yourself, is that what you want? i don\\'t think you want that, is it? .. do ya? huh? \\n\\nelaine: (to myra) he\\'s very highly recommended. so... \\n\\nmohel: (to george) you\\'re holding the baby? \\n\\ngeorge: (getting up out of his chair to get out of the mohel\\'s way) no, no. \\n\\nmohel: hello! who\\'s holding the baby?!? who\\'s holding the baby? \\n\\njerry: (uncertain) yeah. i\\'m holding the baby. \\n\\nelaine: (pushing jerry over to the mohel) ok, go. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m going. \\n\\nelaine: go. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m going. \\n\\nelaine: c\\'mon \\n\\njerry: don\\'t push me. \\n\\nmohel: okay. you sit here. now i need the baby. bring me the baby. i need the baby! \\n\\nkramer: no, i\\'m not going to let this happen. \\n\\nall: (numerous voices) kramer! let go of the baby! kramer! \\n\\nmohel: people compose yourselves. (shouting as the struggle ends) this is a bris. we are performing a bris here, not a burlesque show. this is not a school play! this is not a baggy pants farce! this is a bris. an sacred, ancient ceremony, symbolizing the covenant between god and abraham... or something. (the mohel opens his bag to start the process but drops it and his instruments fall out. people attempt to help him out) no! don\\'t touch it! don\\'t touch a thing! \\n\\nelaine: ok. \\n\\nmohel: (muttering to jerry).. i coulda been a kosher butcher like my brother. the money\\'s good. there\\'s a union, with benefits. and, cows have no families. you make a mistake with a cow, you move on with your life... anyway. \\n\\njerry: hurry up george! step on it! \\n\\ngeorge: alright, alright! \\n\\njerry: that damn mohel - he circumcised my finger! the mohel circumcised my finger! \\n\\nelaine: you flinched. \\n\\njerry: flinched? i did not flinch. george, did i flinch? \\n\\nelaine: oh how would he know. he blacked out. he fainted. \\n\\ngeorge: it was very traumatic. the last thing i remember is you flinching. then, everything went black. \\n\\njerry: who\\'s got a tissues? i need more tissues! look at this thing. it\\'s my phone finger! \\n\\ngeorge: be careful, you\\'re getting blood all over the car. \\n\\nkramer: what about the baby? \\n\\njerry: oh the baby\\'s fine. they just took him to the hospital as a precautionary measure. but look at me. i\\'m the one who\\'s hurt. \\n\\nelaine: would you stop it? you\\'re just gonna need a few stitches. \\n\\njerry: a few stitches? i\\'ve never had stitches. i\\'ll be deformed. i can\\'t live with that. it goes against my whole personality. it\\'s not me! \\n\\ngeorge: hey look a that - boy are you lucky - another great spot - right in front of the hospital. in an emergency yet! how lucky are you huh? is that unbelievable? how unbelievable is that huh? come on, give it to me, give it to me. \\n\\ngeorge: i have never seen a mohel like that. \\n\\njerry: that was a one in a million mohel. \\n\\nelaine: i said i\\'m sorry. \\n\\njerry: look at this. \\n\\nkramer: oh you\\'ll be ok. i\\'ll see you later. \\n\\ngeorge: wha, where is he going? \\n\\njerry: oh well if it isn\\'t shakey the mohel! nice job on the circumcision but it\\'s not supposed to be a finger. \\n\\nmohel: (rejerry) the circumcision was perfect. the finger was your fault! you flinched! \\n\\njerry: oh who made you a mohel? whadya, get your degree from a matchbook? \\n\\nmohel: (he makes a sudden movement) ya see! he flinched again! \\n\\njerry: nice mohel picking, elaine. you picked a helluva mohel! \\n\\nmohel: one more peep out of you and i\\'ll slice you up like a smoked sturgeon. \\n\\njerry: oh don\\'t threaten me, butcher boy. \\n\\nmohel: butcher boy?! \\n\\njerry: ya what was this?

(to elaine) here\\'s my card. \\n\\nkramer: (off screen) outta my way! \\n\\njerry: (struggling to open a bottle with his bandaged finger) i can\\'t do it. (a la godfather) look what they did to my boy, they massacred my boy. \\n\\nelaine: you really do the worst godfather i ever heard. you\\'re not even close. \\n\\njerry: (walking over the the buzzer to answer it) oh, that\\'s the flicks. \\n\\ngeorge: (on phone) it\\'s a \\'76 chevy impala. they stole it right in front of the hospital. i saw the guy drive off in it. well he\\'s about five feet tall, hairless, pink complexion.. (elaine puts her finger on her nose) looks like a pig. yeah, alright alright, thank you, thank you. (kramer enters) so any word from the \"pig-man\"? \\n\\nkramer: no. \\n\\ngeorge: no. and he\\'s not a pig-man is he? \\n\\nkramer: no, he\\'s not.. just a fat little mental patient. \\n\\njerry: myra, stan. \\n\\nmyra: don\\'t touch him \\n\\njerry: what\\'s the matter? \\n\\nstan: you\\'re out, jerry. you\\'re out as godfather. you too, elaine. you\\'re both out. \\n\\nelaine: but i didn\\'t do anything. \\n\\nstan: no, no buts. we made up our minds. (turns to kramer) we want kramer. he showed us how much he cares about steven. \\n\\nkramer: (leaving a la godfather) don\\'t ever go against the family jerry. \\n\\nstan: (grabbing kramer\\'s hand) godfather. \\n\\nmyra: (grabbing kramer\\'s other hand) godfather. \\n\\nkramer: yes \\n\\n*note: during this closing monologue; jerry\\'s finger is bandaged the same way it was during this episode. \\n\\njerry: professional tennis. to me i don\\'t understand all the shushing. why are they always shushing. shh, shh. don\\'t the players know that we\\'re there? should we duck down behind the seats so they don\\'t see us watching them? to me tennis is basically just ping-pong and the players are standing on the table. that\\'s all it is. and that goofy scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you\\'re up by 15. two points, 30-love. 30-love. sounds like an english call girl. \"that\\'ll be 30, love... and could you be a little quieter next time, please, shh.\" \\n\\njerry: are these seats unbelievable or what? \\n\\ngeorge: where\\'s the sunblock? \\n\\njerry: here. \\n\\ngeorge: 25? you don\\'t have anything higher? \\n\\njerry: what, are you on mercury? \\n\\ngeorge: i need higher. this has paba in it, i need paba-free. \\n\\njerry: you got a problem with paba? \\n\\ngeorge: yes, i have a problem with paba. \\n\\njerry: you don\\'t even know what paba is. \\n\\ngeorge: i know enough to stay away from it. \\n\\nannouncer: 30-love \\n\\ngeorge: so are you going to todd\\'s party this weekend? \\n\\njerry: i\\'ll go if someone else drives. you going? \\n\\ngeorge: gwen really wants to go. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re bringing a date to a party? \\n\\ngeorge: no good? \\n\\njerry: a party is a bad date situation. it doesn\\'t matter who you\\'re with. you could be with j. edgar hoover. you don\\'t want to sit and talk with hoover all night. you want to circulate. (makes hand motions) ho, ho, ho. \\n\\ngeorge: why\\'d you pick hoover? was he that interesting to talk to? \\n\\njerry: well i would think, with the law enforcement and the cross dressing. seems like an interesting guy. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah i guess. what can i do? i gotta take her with me. todd introduced us, i\\'m obligated. \\n\\njerry: that woman is absolutely stunning. \\n\\ngeorge: who, the croat? [the tennis player] \\n\\njerry: not the croat, the lineswoman. that is the most beautiful lineswoman i\\'ve ever seen. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, she\\'s a b.l. \\n\\njerry: b.l.? \\n\\ngeorge: beautiful lineswoman. alright listen uh i\\'m going to go to the concession stand and get some real sunblock. you want anything? jerry?

(elaine looks pleased) \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t take my eyes off that lineswoman. the woman is absolutely mesmerizing. \\n\\ngeorge: boy you are really smitten. \\n\\njerry: i gotta talk to her. what do you think? \\n\\ngeorge: cold? how are you going to do that? you\\'re not one of those guys. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m going to psyche myself into it like those people that just walk across the hot coals. \\n\\ngeorge: they\\'re not mocked and humiliated when they get to the other side. \\n\\njerry: i have to. i won\\'t be able to live with myself. \\n\\ngeorge: wait a minute jerry, there\\'s a bigger issue here. if you go through that wall and become one of those guys i\\'ll be left here on this side. take me with you. \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t. \\n\\ngeorge: what are you going to say? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know, \"hi\". \\n\\ngeorge: (laughing) you think you\\'re going to the other side with \"hi\"? you\\'re not going to make it. \\n\\nradio: base to 92 come in \\n\\ndriver: yes this is 92 \\n\\nradio: after this go back to city for a 600 pickup \\n\\ndriver: righteo \\n\\nradio: 794 bleeker the party\\'s hanks. tom hanks. \\n\\nelaine: tom hanks? after me you\\'re picking up tom hanks? i love him. \\n\\ndriver: so i guess your hearing goes in and out huh? \\n\\nelaine: (realizing he caught her) yeah. yes it does... \\n\\ndriver: yeah. you know what i think? i think you made that whole thing up. \\n\\nelaine: no no, no no. \\n\\ndriver: yeah yeah, i know your type. you\\'re too good to make conversation with someone like me. oh god forbid you could discuss the jumbles. but to go so far as to pretend you\\'re almost deaf, i mean that is truly disgusting. and mr. tom hanks, may i say he too would be disgusted by your behavior. \\n\\njerry: excuse me. (woman ignores him) excuse me? (still ignores him) oh that\\'s nice. that\\'s right ignore me. that\\'s real polite. yea nobody\\'s even talking to you. all you big lineswoman. oh you\\'ve got some kind of a cool job. i know your type thinking your too good for everyone, but it\\'s women like you (woman turns around and notices him) oh well, what are you deaf? \\n\\nlaura: bingo. \\n\\nkramer: and you\\'re saying she\\'s deaf. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m not *saying* she\\'s deaf, she\\'s deaf. \\n\\nkramer: can\\'t hear a thing. \\n\\njerry: can\\'t hear a thing. \\n\\nkramer: and you\\'re going to go out with her. \\n\\njerry: yeah, isn\\'t that something? \\n\\nelaine: hey. \\n\\njerry & kramer: hey. \\n\\nkramer: hey i know how to sign. \\n\\njerry: really? \\n\\nkramer: yeah when i was 8, i had a deaf cousin who lived with us for about a year. (signing as he speaks) so i haven\\'t been able to do it in a while. \\n\\nelaine: what is this about? \\n\\njerry: i met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match. \\n\\nelaine: you are kidding. that is amazing. (she pushes jerry, jerry falls back into kramer.) i just took a car service from work and to get the driver to not talk to me, i pretended i was going deaf. \\n\\njerry: wow good plan. \\n\\nelaine: oh didn\\'t work. he caught me hearing. alright it\\'s terrible, but i\\'m not a terrible person. \\n\\njerry & kramer: no. \\n\\nelaine: no. when i shoo squirrels away, i always say \"get out of here\". i never ever throw things at them and try to injure them like other people. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s nice. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, and when i see freaks in the street i never, ever stare at them. yet, i\\'m careful not to look away, see, because i want to make the freaks feel comfortable. \\n\\njerry: (turning to kramer) that\\'s nice for the freaks. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, and i don\\'t poof up my hair when i got to a movie so people behind me can see. i\\'ve got to make it up to this guy or i won\\'t be able to live with myself. what can i do? \\n\\njerry: why don\\'t you get him some tickets or something, how about that friend of yours that works at the ticket agency. \\n\\nkramer: yeah yeah pete, he can get you great tickets to something. \\n\\nelaine: really? \\n\\nkramer: like a rock concert. whatever you like. \\n\\nelaine: oh great, thanks kramer. \\n\\nkramer: you got it. hey jerry, do me a favor. the next time you see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs. i would love to be able to do that. \\n\\njerry: kramer, i think perhaps you\\'ve overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity. it\\'s ball *boys*, not ball men. there are no ball men. \\n\\nelaine: yeah i think he\\'s right. i\\'ve never seen a ball man. \\n\\nkramer: well there ought to be ball men. \\n\\njerry: all right i\\'ll talk to her. if you want to be a ball man go ahead, break the ball barrier.

(moves his arm slowly) i can control it if i really concentrate. but otherwise, (arm moves) oh. \\n\\ndoctor: uh huh. yes, well, i\\'m going to have to be perfectly honest with you. \\n\\ngeorge: please, doctor. \\n\\ndoctor: i\\'ve examined you. \\n\\ngeorge: yes. \\n\\ndoctor: i\\'ve looked at your x-rays. \\n\\ngeorge: uh-huh. \\n\\ndoctor: and i find that there\\'s absolutely nothing wrong with you. \\n\\ngeorge: hmm. really? nothing? \\n\\ndoctor: nothing, that would indicate involuntary spasms. \\n\\ngeorge: well, it\\'s kind of a mystery, isn\\'t it? \\n\\ndoctor: no, not really. \\n\\ngeorge: how so? \\n\\ndoctor: may i suggest the possibility that you\\'re faking? \\n\\ngeorge: faking? what makes you think that i have time to see doctors, take x-rays, make appointments, when there\\'s absolutely nothing wrong with me? what kind of a person would do a thing like that? \\n\\ndoctor: i don\\'t know what kind of a person would do something like that. obviously a very sick person. a very immature person. a person who has no regard for wasting other people\\'s valuable time. good-bye. \\n\\ngeorge: now, see here, doctor. \\n\\ndoctor: i said, good-bye. \\n\\ngeorge: fine. (hits his arm on the desk) ow! \\n\\nelaine: jerry, come on, look. let\\'s go over to that yogurt store. \\n\\njerry: look, elaine, i\\'ve been thinking about this. this has got to be a massive conspiracy. who knows how deep it goes. hey, look, wait a second, (looking at the tv) kramer, turn that up. \\n\\nkramer: huh, okay. \\n\\nnews: rudy giuliani, who underwent a physical last week, received some startling news today, when his cholesterol count turned out to be a whopping 375. what effect this will have on the minds of the voters remains to be seen. in another development, mayor dinkins has fired his top advisor, lloyd braun, who is believed to be responsible for the name tag fiasco. we now take you to giuliani headquarters where rudy giuliani is about to make a statement. \\n\\ngiuliani: it\\'s hard to understand. because i\\'ve been doing everything i normally do. i\\'ve been watching my diet very carefully. i exercise regularly. my only indulgence, i guess, would be that i eat a lot of frozen yogurt. but it\\'s non-fat. \\n\\njerry: non-fat yogurt? oh, my god. they got giuliani and he doesn\\'t even know it. \\n\\nelaine: (pointing to kramer) now look what you\\'ve done. \\n\\njerry: well, we\\'ve got to do something. (grabs his phone) i\\'m calling giuliani\\'s headquarters. \\n\\ngeorge: name tags! name tags! what kind of an idiot thinks anybody would be interested in an idea like that. \\n\\nfrank: i don\\'t think it\\'s so bad. people should wear name tags. everyone would be a lot friendlier. \"hello, sam.\" \"how are you doing, joe?\" (george\\'s arm moves and hits the lamp) hey, your arm. it moved again. i thought you said it went away. \\n\\ngeorge: i banged it on the desk in the doctor\\'s office. an (worriedly rubbing his arm) aaaa . . . \\n\\nestelle: be quiet. they\\'re starting the press conference. \\n\\ngiuliani: my campaign staff has received some very disturbing information regarding the fat content in yogurt that\\'s being sold throughout the city. i pledge to you now, that if i\\'m elected mayor, as my first order of business i\\'ll appoint a special task force to investigate this matter. i promise you, my fellow new yorkers, that mayor giuliani will do everything possible to cleanse this city of this falsified non-fat yogurt. \\n\\njerry: the old yogurt was so much better. oh, this is terrible. \\n\\ngeorge: phew! \\n\\nelaine: oh, it stinks. \\n\\nkramer: mine, too. i got one more day. \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t eat this. \\n\\nnewman: (from the corner of the yogurt shop) hey, jerry. thanks a lot. i hope you\\'re happy. \\n\\njerry: it had fat in it, it\\'s not good for you. \\n\\nnewman: i don\\'t care. it was good. i was enjoying it. had to interfere. couldn\\'t leave well enough alone. well, i will get even with you for this. you can count on it. \\n\\nelaine: hey, you guys, listen to this. listen to this. (reading from the newspaper) apparently some blood spilled into mr. giuliani\\'s test tube causing his cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was initially reported. ironically, the mishap by bringing the non-fat yogurt scandal to the attention of the public, probably clinched the election for the republican. it was the one issue which seemed to electrify the voters and swept giuliani into office. \\n\\njerry: so, in effect, the yogurt won him the election. \\n\\nelaine: i wonder what actually happened in that lab. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, me, too. \\n\\nnewman: i can\\'t eat this. \\n\\nmatthew: (hits jerry to get his attention) thanks for ruining my daddy\\'s business, you fat *beep*(fuck). \\n\\njerry: the old-fashioned barber shop is unfortunately becoming a thing of the past, now what went wrong? well first of all there\\'s a twenty thousand dollar chair to make a three dollar tip. i say cut back on the chair, update the magazines. why do barbers always display that license? there\\'s no laws in hair cutting, except show every person the back of their head that\\'s the one law. i don\\'t want to see the back of my head. why do i want to see something that i\\'m never going to see at any other time? when i buy pants two salesmen don\\'t lift me up by the legs and go \"how do you like crotch?\" if i wanted to see everything i would have been a fly. \\n\\nmr. tuttle: well george we here at sanalac like to think of ourselves as a fairly progressive company. we have a small but prestigious group of clients. \\n\\ngeorge: well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious. \\n\\nmr. tuttle: that\\'s funny george. you\\'re very quick. i feel like i, like i don\\'t have to explain every little thing to you. you understand everything immediately. \\n\\ngeorge: i enjoy understanding. \\n\\nmr. tuttle: i want you to have this job. of course... \\n\\nsecretary: mr. zimmer is on line 2. \\n\\nmr. tuttle: thanks. i\\'ve got to take this call. listen, i\\'m really glad that you came in. \\n\\ngeorge: i want you to have this job. of course... \\n\\njerry & elaine: yeah? \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s it. \\n\\njerry: what do you mean that\\'s it? \\n\\ngeorge: he never finished the sentence. he got a call, that was the end of the interview. \\n\\njerry: \"of course\" was the last thing he said? \\n\\ngeorge: maybe he was going to say \"of course i have to check with my associates.\" \\n\\nelaine: \"i want you to have this job, of course the board of directors is under indictment and will be serving time.\" \\n\\njerry: \"i want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a prerequisite.\" \\n\\ngeorge: all right. \\n\\nelaine: why don\\'t you go ahead and call him? \\n\\ngeorge: because he made a big deal about how i understand everything immediately. that\\'s what impressed him. \\n\\njerry: so if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose the job. \\n\\ngeorge: and if i don\\'t call... \\n\\njerry: you might have the job, but you\\'ll never know it. what kind of company is it? \\n\\ngeorge: rest stop supply. \\n\\nelaine & jerry: oh. \\n\\nelaine: good for you. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, yeah, yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: hey \\n\\njerry: hey \\n\\nkramer: hey. \\n\\njerry: shower? \\n\\nkramer: haircut. \\n\\njerry: oh. \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m very happy with this. \\n\\njerry: who\\'d you use? gino? \\n\\nkramer: oh course. i wouldn\\'t let that other butcher cut my hair. \\n\\nelaine: what butcher? \\n\\nkramer: the uncle enzo. that\\'s the guy jerry uses. \\n\\njerry: well i\\'ve been going with him for 12 years. i can\\'t switch. i\\'d hurt his feelings. \\n\\nelaine: you never get good haircuts. \\n\\nkramer: you can get a good one today. it\\'s enzo\\'s day off. gino\\'s there all by himself. \\n\\njerry: really? \\n\\nelaine: yeah. you know what, you should go over there and get one to look good for my bachelor auction. \\n\\nkramer: what bachelor auction? \\n\\nelaine: oh it\\'s a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors for charity. \\n\\nkramer: and you didn\\'t ask me to do it? i could raise enough money to cure polio. \\n\\njerry: i believe they\\'ve had a cure for polio for quite some time. \\n\\nkramer: polio? \\n\\nelaine: will you go ahead? you need a haircut. \\n\\njerry: okay. \\n\\nkramer: what are you all dressed up for? \\n\\ngeorge: i had a job interview. \\n\\nkramer: yeah. how\\'d it go? \\n\\ngeorge: good. of course... \\n\\nenzo: oh jerry. \\n\\njerry: oh hi enzo. \\n\\nenzo: oh, you\\'ve come for the haircut. \\n\\njerry: no, actually i was just gonna... \\n\\nenzo: it\\'s my day off, but i take care of you anyway because you\\'re my favorite customer. you\\'ve been with me for so long. you\\'re so loyal. \\n\\njerry: well i, if it\\'s your day off i really... (tries to leave) \\n\\nenzo: (he pulls jerry into the barber chair. jerry is trying to get away but can\\'t.) eh, what\\'s the difference. it takes 10 minutes. jerry, today i\\'m going to do something special for you. \\n\\njerry: well i don\\'t want to take too much off. \\n\\nenzo: hey who\\'s your barber, eh? you tell the joke, i cut the hair. \\n\\nman: gino, you\\'ve outdone yourself this time. this is the best haircut i\\'ve ever had. \\n\\ngeorge: he massacred you. \\n\\njerry: i know. \\n\\ngeorge: you look like you\\'re five years old. \\n\\njerry: what if i shampoo? sometimes a shampoo helps. \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'ve got to start seeing someone else. get out of this relationship. \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t. he loves me. he says i\\'m his most loyal customer. plus he\\'s right there on the corner. i\\'d have to pass him every day when i go by. \\n\\ngeorge: well, you gotta do it. \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t, i can\\'t. i\\'d break his heart. \\n\\nkramer: no way my gino did that. it\\'s an enzo. \\n\\njerry: he was in the shop. i thought you told me he wasn\\'t going to be there. \\n\\nkramer: so what? \\n\\njerry: i didn\\'t want to hurt his feelings. \\n\\nkramer: his feelings? you can\\'t continue seeing him. you\\'re destroying yourself. \\n\\njerry: yea but... \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m not going to let you. if you don\\'t call him i will. \\n\\njerry: no, no kramer. i don\\'t want you to do that. you can\\'t do that. \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m going to call gino, you\\'re going to see him, and we\\'re going to get that haircut fixed up. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t want you to call him. \\n\\nkramer: all right, geez. you\\'re crazy. \\n\\ngeorge: so i still haven\\'t heard about that job. \\n\\njerry: yeah that\\'s a tough one. what are you going to do about that? \\n\\ngeorge: i have an idea. \\n\\njerry: yeah? \\n\\ngeorge: i show up. \\n\\njerry: what do you mean you show up? \\n\\ngeorge: i show up. i pretend i have the job. the guy\\'s on vacation. if i have the job, it\\'s fine. if i don\\'t have the job, by the time he comes back, i\\'m ensconced. \\n\\njerry: hmm. not bad. \\n\\ngeorge: what\\'s the worst thing that could happen? \\n\\njerry: well, you\\'d be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a large group of people and have to walk out in shame with your tail between your legs. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, so? \\n\\njerry: yeah, i see what you mean. i forgot who i was dealing with here. \\n\\ngeorge: (to various people as he walks in) good morning. good morning. good morning. hi nice to see you. how are you. good morning. (to the secretary) good morning. \\n\\nsecretary: how can i help you? \\n\\ngeorge: the name\\'s george constanza. i\\'m starting work here today. i was wondering if you could tell me where my office is. \\n\\nsecretary: i wasn\\'t aware that, uh, mike, this is george constanza. he\\'s starting here today. \\n\\nmike: welcome aboard. \\n\\ngeorge: thanks mike. nice to be aboard. \\n\\nmike: i wasn\\'t aware that mr. tuttle was finished interviewing. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, well, he was probably just getting anxious to start his vacation. \\n\\nsecretary: he wants to know where his office is. \\n\\nmike: oh, ah, let\\'s see, we\\'ve got two. there\\'s a big one down the hall there and a small one over here. you know i should ask jack. \\n\\ngeorge: oh leave jack alone. jack\\'s got enough problems. i\\'ll just take the small office. \\n\\nmike: really? \\n\\ngeorge: yes. i like to feel cozy. i have a very small apartment. i like to feel tucked in, nestled in. love to be nestled. \\n\\nmike: all right, it\\'s 808 right down there. meanwhile, i\\'ll get you the pensky file, you can start working on that. \\n\\ngeorge: yes, yes of course. the pensky file. ho ho, can\\'t wait to sink my teeth into that. wow that pensky. well we\\'ll straighten him out. \\n\\n(camera shot at the clock on his wall. the clock says 9: 00.) \\n\\n(a moment later, the clock flips to 5: 00.) \\n\\njerry: so what did you do there all day? \\n\\ngeorge: they gave me the pensky file. \\n\\njerry: so it\\'s a nice place to work? \\n\\ngeorge: you know i\\'m enjoying it very much. i think my coworkers are really taking to me. \\n\\ngeorge: (continuing) i feel like a family. in fact, yesterday was grace\\'s birthday. she\\'s such a sweet woman so, we had a little party, with cake and champagne. i made a toast. \\n\\njerry: what about your boss? the guys you interviewed you? \\n\\ngeorge: he\\'ll be back on monday. \\n\\njerry: hi. \\n\\nelaine: hi. how come you\\'re wearing a hat? \\n\\njerry: i got a haircut. \\n\\nelaine: oh yeah? can i see it? \\n\\njerry: oh there\\'s nothing to see. \\n\\nelaine: come on. let me see it. \\n\\njerry: forget it. \\n\\nelaine: come on. \\n\\njerry: all right. \\n\\njerry: alright, that\\'s very good. thank you. \\n\\nelaine: (still laughing, tears in her eyes) i\\'m sorry. i\\'m so sorry. \\n\\njerry: well i\\'ll tell you this, you can forget about me going to that bachelor auction. \\n\\nelaine: what? no jerry, you have to go. \\n\\ngeorge: you know elaine, i\\'d do it but i\\'m working that day. \\n\\nelaine: (dryly) yeah, too bad. \\n\\nkramer: it the worst haircut jerry\\'s ever had. you gotta fix it. \\n\\ngino: sure, i fix. but you gotta make sure you no tell anybody. he\\'s a little crazy. i don\\'t know what he\\'d do if he found out i touch jerry\\'s hair. \\n\\nkramer: yeah yeah yeah. \\n\\ngino: (enzo enters) so i love the edward scissorhands. that\\'s the best movie i\\'ve ever seen. \\n\\nenzo: oh ah, again with the edward scissorhand. how can you have hand like a scissor, huh? show me one person who\\'s got hand like a scissor. \\n\\ngino: hey, it\\'s a beautiful dream. i\\'d love to be this man. \\n\\nenzo: did you ever think about what you\\'re going to do on the toilet?

(2 co-workers enter elaine\\'s office) oh jer, i gotta go. i gotta go. (she hangs up) \\n\\njoanne: hi, we just saw your boyfriend at a bus stop. \\n\\nelaine: oh, yeah? \\n\\njoanne: yeah. what\\'s his name? \\n\\nelaine: joel... \\n\\njoanne: joel what? \\n\\nelaine: uh... (clears her throat) rifkin. \\n\\nmichael: rifkin? joel rifkin? \\n\\nelaine: yeah. it\\'s just a coincidence obviously. \\n\\nmichael: guess you better keep on his good side. \\n\\nelaine: very funny. that\\'s very funny. \\n\\njoanne: i wouldn\\'t sleep with my back to him if i were you. \\n\\nelaine: all right. well that\\'s enough of that. that\\'s enough. \\n\\nmichael: hey elaine listen. if you smell anything decaying in the trunk of his car... \\n\\nelaine: (she\\'s upset, gets up and yells) ok look this is my boyfriend we\\'re talking about ok? and he\\'s a gentlemen, he\\'s good looking, he\\'s a good shaver and he hasn\\'t thrown up in eigth years so just shut up about him! shut up! \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s] \\n\\nelaine: the whole city is talking about this monster joel rifkin, and i am dating a joel rifkin. \\n\\njerry: but you like your joel rifkin. \\n\\nelaine: yeah. i just wish he has a different name. \\n\\njerry: ask him to change it. \\n\\nelaine: you can\\'t ask a person to change their name. \\n\\njerry: why not? \\n\\nelaine: would you change yours? \\n\\njerry: if someone asked me nicely. i\\'m claude seinfeld. \\n\\nelaine: hey, how many people did rifkin strangle? eighteen? \\n\\njerry: yeah. eighteen strangles. \\n\\nkramer: you know why rifkin was a serial killer? because he was adopted. (saying it as he\\'s taking a lot of paper towels from jerry\\'s roll; elaine and jerry are confused at kramer\\'s statement) just like son of sam was adopted. so apparently adoption leads to serial killing. (kramer leaves and we don\\'t know why he needed so much paper towels) \\n\\nelaine: you know joel and i have an extra ticket to the giants game. \\n\\nkramer: i\\'ll go. \\n\\nelaine: o.k. i\\'ll leave the ticket for you at will call. \\n\\nkramer: yeah! ooh! (leaves again) \\n\\nelaine: you think i should have asked george? \\n\\njerry: hey did you hear that george got back with karen? \\n\\nelaine: karen? \\n\\njerry: risotto. (we see a flashback from the mango where karen tells george that she feels full after a risotto, as opposed to when she has sex with him) \\n\\nelaine: oh! the risotto broad. \\n\\njerry: yeah. he\\'s really got a good thing with her. in fact i\\'m doubling with them tonight. \\n\\nelaine: i tought you didn\\'t like double dates. \\n\\njerry: george likes them, he feels it\\'s a good personality showcase. he likes a date to see him with a friend so she can get a window into his nondate personality. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'ve looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the blinds. \\n\\njerry: he feels he\\'s funnier, more relaxed. \\n\\nelaine: and you\\'re taking... \\n\\njerry: jody the masseuse. \\n\\nelaine: hey, did you get a massage yet? \\n\\njerry: no! how many times do i have to go out with her before i get a massage? \\n\\nelaine: jerry, she gives massages all day. she doesn\\'t wanna to give them on dates. \\n\\njerry: yeah i know... she just wants to have sex. \\n\\nelaine: so what? \\n\\njerry: so it\\'s like going to idhao and eating carrots. i like carrots, but i\\'m in idhao, i want a potato. \\n\\n[setting: the chinese restaurant (the same as in \\'the chinese restaurant\\')] \\n\\ngeorge: (george is telling a story. karen is laughing and she seems to be the only one to find him funny) so i go into this clothing store and the saleswoman is wearing this (whistling) low cut thing. so i said to her \"can i ask you a question? when you put on a top like that, what\\'s your tought process? what\\'s going on in your mind?\" \\n\\nkaren: that is so funny. \\n\\ngeorge: (to jody) you\\'re listening to this? \\n\\njodi: yeah. i heard you. \\n\\njerry: (to jody) my neck is killing me. right in this spot. very tender over here. \\n\\njodi: (to george) so what did she say? \\n\\ngeorge: well nothing. i didn\\'t actually say that. (karen is still laughing) \\n\\njodi: you just said that you said it. \\n\\ngeorge: sweetheart, i was exaggerating. \\n\\nkaren: i\\'m learning a lot about you tonight george. i\\'ve never seen you like this. \\n\\njerry: (touching the back of his neck) it\\'s like somebody\\'s pulling on wires back here. \\n\\ngeorge: you know it\\'s like you never see a really attractive woman getting a traffic ticket. \\n\\njodi: how can you say that? my sister got a ticket last week. are you saying she\\'s not attractive? \\n\\ngeorge: well i\\'ve never met your sister but obviously these are not hard-and-fast rules. (to the waitress) darling, the tea is getting a little cold sweetheart. \\n\\njodi: (to jerry) can we go? \\n\\njerry: yeah. let\\'s go. \\n\\nkaren: so soon? (they get up) \\n\\njerry: yeah. good seeing you again karen. \\n\\nkaren: yeah. \\n\\njodi: nice meeting you karen. \\n\\nkaren: yeah. nice to meet you too and i\\'m gonna call you about that massage. \\n\\njodi: oh yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: jody let\\'s do this agian real soon (he tends his arms for a hug but she avoids him) \\n\\njodi: yeah. (she and jerry walk away) \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s place later that night] \\n\\njerry: i strained my neck last night. \\n\\njodi: really, how? \\n\\njerry: i tried brushing my teeth by holding the brush and moving my head from side to side. it didn\\'t work. \\n\\njodi: so what\\'s the deal with your friend george? \\n\\njerry: no deal. why? \\n\\njodi: what was all that \"attractive women not getting tickets\" nonsense? \\n\\njerry: oh well, he was just showcasing his nondate pesonality. \\n\\njodi: i don\\'t know how you can hang out with that guy. \\n\\njerry: yeah. sometimes he really makes me tense (he takes jody\\'s hand and put it on his shoulder) \\n\\njodi: did you see the way that he was eating? \\n\\njerry: yeah, he\\'s disgusting. (putting her hand back on his shoulder. she unconsciously starts to massage a little while watching tv) \\n\\njodi: i have to tell you, i really don\\'t like him. \\n\\njerry: yeah, me either. (he takes her other hand and put it on his other shoulder) \\n\\njodi: it\\'s just i hate that type. \\n\\njerry: yeah, he\\'s a bad seed. \\n\\njodi: now you however, you, i like. (she stops massaging and kisses jerry) \\n\\njerry: what are you doing? \\n\\njodi: what do you think i\\'m doing? (he won\\'t get his massage...) \\n\\n[setting: the chinese restaurant] \\n\\ngeorge: so, what do you think? \\n\\nkaren: really enjoyed it. \\n\\ngeorge: jody\\'s nice. \\n\\nkaren: she\\'s very nice. (grabs george\\'s hand) let\\'s discuss this later. \\n\\ngeorge: you think she liked me? she seemed to like me. \\n\\nkaren: yeah \\n\\ngeorge: i was personable. don\\'t you think i was personable? \\n\\nkaren: you were extremely personable. \\n\\ngeorge: i tought i picked up a little something. i\\'m very good at this. did you pick up anything? \\n\\nkaren: i didn\\'t pick up anything. \\n\\ngeorge: the second time i sent the noodles back, i tought she made a face... \\n\\nkaren: i didn\\'t see a face. \\n\\ngeorge: i tought i saw a face. \\n\\nkaren: anyhow, what is the difference? \\n\\ngeorge: no difference. i could care less. she\\'s jerry\\'s girlfriend. \\n\\nkaren: george, george, instead of talking about this, we could be... you know... (she makes a move with her head like george did in \\'the mango\\' while saying \"instead of the movie...\") \\n\\ngeorge: he he he he \\n\\nkaren: ah ah ah ah \\n\\ngeorge: so you think she likes me? \\n\\n[setting: elaine\\'s place] \\n\\nelaine: (as he touches her) uhh! what are you doing? \\n\\njoel: massaging your neck. \\n\\nelaine: oh. huh. of course. massaging. \\n\\njoel: uh, boning up on football? (talking about the magazine she\\'s reading as he sits beside her) \\n\\nelaine: yeah, yeah. you know what? there are a lot of players named deon these days. what a cool name, deon. if i were gonna change my name, i\\'d go with deon. \\n\\njoel: deon benes? \\n\\nelaine: well as a woman, it makes no sense. but, i mean, let\\'s say i was you. and i decided i was gonna change my name for no real reasons whatsoever-- deon rifkin. wow! that is so cool. \\n\\njoel: d-deon rifkin? \\n\\nelaine: well maybe you\\'re not the dion type. o.k. then let\\'s see, let\\'s see, what do we got? (looking at the magazine, she starts to gasp and loses it) oh! oh oh oh! o.j.! o.j. rifkin! you don\\'t even use a name, it\\'s just initials. oh please please please change your name to o.j.! please, it would be so great! \\n\\njoel: elaine! what is going on? \\n\\n[setting: monk\\'s] \\n\\ngeorge: she stayed over? \\n\\njerry: yeah. (disappointed) \\n\\ngeorge: the sex wasn\\'t so good? \\n\\njerry: no. the sex was fabulous. \\n\\ngeorge: so? \\n\\njerry: i want the massage! \\n\\ngeorge: did you ask her? \\n\\njerry: i tried putting her hands there (on his neck) but she pulls it away immediately, she\\'s not into it. \\n\\ngeorge: why not? \\n\\njerry: i guess \\'cause it\\'s her job. it\\'s very frustrating. \\n\\ngeorge: so we had a good time... the four of us. \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: we all got along. everyone seemed very pleasant. \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: what did jodi say? \\n\\njerry: she had a good time. \\n\\ngeorge: is that it? \\n\\njerry: pretty much. \\n\\ngeorge: did she say anything about, uh... \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\ngeorge: nah. it\\'s all right. great! she had a good time. \\n\\njerry: yeah (a so-so yeah as he takes a sip of coffee) \\n\\ngeorge: you just hesitated. \\n\\njerry: i was blowing on the coffee. \\n\\ngeorge: she didn\\'t like me? \\n\\njerry: look it\\'s not like you\\'re gonna be spending a lot of time with her. \\n\\ngeorge: so she doesn\\'t like me? \\n\\njerry: no. \\n\\ngeorge: she said that? \\n\\njerry: yes. \\n\\ngeorge: she told you she doesn\\'t like me! \\n\\njerry: yes. \\n\\ngeorge: what were her exact-- \\n\\njerry: \"i don\\'t like him.\" \\n\\ngeorge: uh-huh (gulp) why didn\\'t she like me? \\n\\njerry: not everybody likes everybody! \\n\\ngeorge: i tried to be nice. i wasn\\'t nice? \\n\\njerry: you were very nice! \\n\\ngeorge: i bent over backwards for that woman! is it that thing i said about her sister? \\n\\njerry: it has nothing to do with her sister. \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t even know her sister but believe me, if she\\'s getting traffic tickets, she\\'s not that good-looking! woah \\n\\n[setting: hall in jerry\\'s building] \\n\\ngeorge: you vomited in 1987. \\n\\njerry: oh no. that was the dry heaves. \\n\\njerry: jodi. \\n\\njodi: hey, jerry. \\n\\ngeorge: ha! ha! hey! (moving his arms like it\\'s so great to be all here) \\n\\njerry: what are you doing here? \\n\\njodi: i was giving kramer a massage. \\n\\njerry: kramer! (tries to hide he\\'s upset and jealous) \\n\\njodi: i got to run. i have an appointment downtown. \\n\\ngeorge: here. let me take your tabe downstairs for you. \\n\\njodi: no that\\'s o.k. \\n\\ngeorge: please give it to me. i love to help people. this is what i do. come on. i\\'m going this way. (he takes the table from jodi\\'s hands and she has no choice but to follow him) \\n\\njerry: i\\'ll see you tonight. (he\\'s opening his door apartment as kramer comes out of his in a bathrobe) \\n\\nkramer: hey! i am looser than creamed corn! \\n\\njerry: who told you to get a massage from her. i haven\\'t gotten a massage from her yet! \\n\\nkramer: you don\\'t know what you\\'re missing buddy. \\n\\n[setting: street in front of jerry\\'s building] \\n\\ngeorge: no one hails a cab like me. my hailing technique is unmatched. i get the wrist going from side to side and boom! cabs are crashing into themselves to just pick me up. (a cab stops) all right, here we go. let me get door. feminists aside, i know women like the door holding. here we are all righty. o.k. jodi let\\'s get together again real soon and say hello to your sister for me. \\n\\njodi: you\\'ve never met. (the cab starts and george is following to keep talking to jodi) \\n\\ngeorge: whatever. believe me, if i wasn\\'t involved right now, i wouldn\\'t mind being set up. something tells me she\\'s a knockout. (we see, from the camera inside the cab, george\\'s hand waving as the cab drives away) \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\nkramer: (kramer is talking much more slowly and smoother than usual) first she sets the mood perfectly with this new age music played over ocean sounds. then she lays you out on this table, and she proceeds to rub oil over your entire body. and she rubs long... and deep... jerry, she rubs with love. (jerry is obviously cutting much harder than the cheese needs it as he listens to kramer) every muscles she touches just... (long pause) ooo-zz-es. beneath those silky, soft fingers, you can scarcely contain yourself, buddy. (jerry slams down the knife and goes to the couch) \\n\\njerry: so you had a good time. \\n\\nkramer: oh... yeah... \\n\\njerry: enjoyed yourself. \\n\\nkramer: very... much... \\n\\njerry: all right now you listen and you listen good! (he grabs kramer\\'s legs and throws him down the couch) \\n\\nkramer: what! (kramer is back to his usual way of speaking) \\n\\njerry: the massages are out! \\n\\nkramer: wha-- \\n\\njerry: ahh!!! they\\'re out! \\n\\nkramer: why?! \\n\\njerry: because if i can\\'t get one, you\\'re not getting one. \\n\\nkramer: wait a minute! wait a minute! i need my massages! can\\'t you see i\\'m burned out! \\n\\njerry: i\\'m sorry, kramer. (he goes back to the kitchen) \\n\\nkramer: why? why? look, i paid for her. (jerry stops walking) \\n\\njerry: don\\'t you ever talk about her like that! \\n\\nkramer: but why? \\n\\njerry: that\\'s final!!! \\n\\nkramer: ah!!! yahh!!! \\n\\n[setting: giants stadium] \\n\\nannouncer: ladies and gentlemen, welcome to giants stadium. \\n\\nelaine: oh, you have photos in your wallet? \\n\\njoel: yeah. why? is that weird? \\n\\nelaine: no, it\\'s normal. you\\'re very normal. you\\'re totally normal. who\\'s this? \\n\\njoel: that\\'s my mother. \\n\\nelaine: oh yeah. i see the resemblance. \\n\\njoel: no, there\\'s no resemblance. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, there is, right here you see-- \\n\\njoel: elaine, i was adopted. \\n\\nelaine: (pause) oh. that\\'s nice. \\n\\njoel: oh, the game\\'s about to start. i wonder where your friend kramer is. \\n\\n[setting: ticket counter] \\n\\nkramer: (to the ticket man) uh, yeah, a ticket for kramer. \\n\\nticket man: here it is. i need some i.d. \\n\\nkramer: oh, yeah. (snaps fingers) you know, i forgot my wallet. \\n\\nticket man: well, i can\\'t give it to you then. \\n\\nkramer: are you kidding me? \\n\\nticket man: i\\'m afraid not. \\n\\nkramer: come on, just look at me. tell me i\\'m not kramer. \\n\\nticket man: i\\'m sorry. i need proof. \\n\\nkramer: look, i\\'ll drive out here tomorrow and i\\'ll show the i.d. i got nothing to do all day. \\n\\nticket man: neither do i. but without i.d., i need confirmation from the person who left the ticket. \\n\\nkramer: where\\'s a phone? \\n\\n[setting: back to elaine and joel watching the game] \\n\\nannouncer: ladies and gentlemen, may i have your attention, please? would joel rifkin report to the stadium office. joel rifkin...telephone. (the crowd stops cheering and we see a football player, lawrence taylor of the n.y. giants, distracted from the game while hearing the announcer saying joel rifkin) \\n\\njoel: who would be calling me here? (he stands up and look around) \\n\\nelaine: (to the person in front of her) he\\'s not the murderer. \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\nkramer: oh, god. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s the matter with you? \\n\\nkramer: jerry, i need another massage! \\n\\njerry: you just had one yesterday. what do you need another one for? \\n\\nkramer: because of the giant game! i told you, it went overtime! you know what those seats are like. they\\'re very unforgiving. \\n\\njerry: oh please. \\n\\nkramer: and then the game-winning field goal went over the net and into the crowd and i dove over three rows! my back, it\\'s killing me! (whining) it\\'s killing me jerry! \\n\\njerry: well, did you get the ball? \\n\\nkramer: oh i got the ball. \\n\\njerry: well, i never even caught a foul ball at a baseball game. \\n\\nkramer: well, it\\'s quite a thrill. \\n\\njerry: why don\\'t you get somebody else? \\n\\nkramer: because nobody does it like she does. she\\'s the best. \\n\\njerry: well, that\\'s it! tonight\\'s the night. i\\'m getting one. no \"if and\\'s or but\\'s\". \\n\\nkramer: what about my massage? \\n\\njerry: (whining like kramer) ask newman. \\n\\n[setting: monk\\'s] \\n\\ngeorge: so i lugged that table. that big heavy massage table all the way down to the cab! you ever seen one of those things? \\n\\nkaren: of course. \\n\\ngeorge: no, i don\\'t know. maybe you haven\\'t. you know, not everybody\\'s seen a massage table. \\n\\nkaren: what, do you think i\\'ve never had a massage before? \\n\\ngeorge: anyway, i don\\'t even get a thank you. i don\\'t get it! \\n\\nkaren: george, frankly, i\\'m getting a little tired of hearing about her. \\n\\ngeorge: i wanna know what i did to this woman. \\n\\nkaren: what, you got a little thing for her? \\n\\ngeorge: no, no! she\\'s going out with a friend of mine. it\\'s only courteous that we should try and like each other. \\n\\nkaren: what difference does it make? who cares if she doesn\\'t like you? does everybody in the world have to like you? \\n\\ngeorge: yes! yes! everybody has to like me. i must be liked! \\n\\n[setting: elaine\\'s apartment] \\n\\nelaine: of course i support your decision to change your name. \\n\\njoel: after the giant game i realized that this--this problem isn\\'t going away. \\n\\nelaine: well, listen, i just want you to know that i was more than willing to stick it out with joel rifkin. \\n\\njoel: sure? \\n\\nelaine: (she fakes a strangling) rrr... \\n\\njoel: o.k. you got your list? \\n\\nelaine: yeah. yeah. 10 names. \\n\\njoel: right. \\n\\nelaine: o.k. and if somebody objects, you can just veto it. \\n\\njoel: o.k. \\n\\nelaine: o.k. you start. what\\'s your first choice? \\n\\njoel: stuart. \\n\\nelaine: (right away) no. second choice. \\n\\njoel: stu--stuart\\'s no good? \\n\\nelaine: i have never met a normal guy named stuart. \\n\\njoel: o-o.k. my second choice is... todd. \\n\\nelaine: (repeating to hear how it sounds) todd. (pause) no. veto. \\n\\njoel: all right. oh, hey, i think you\\'re gonna like my first my third choice. \\n\\nelaine: great... \\n\\njoel: alex. \\n\\nelaine: i gotta tell ya, i have a bad association with the name alex. \\n\\njoel: bad bad association? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, in college i sat next to an alex in art history. and he was always drinking coffee and after every sip he would go \"ahh\". i mean every two seconds \"ahh\". and he would take like 40 sips and after everyone \"ahh\". i had to drop the class. \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s place] \\n\\njodi: hey. \\n\\njerry: hi. \\n\\njodi: hi. (kiss) i was running late and i didn\\'t have a chance to drop off my stuff before i came over. \\n\\njerry: ah, no problem. that\\'s fine. \\n\\njodi: what\\'s with this music? \\n\\njerry: that\\'s new age music. sounds of the forest. i find it soothing. hey, look at this! what do you know? a massage table! this is great! (he starts to install the table) \\n\\njodi: what are you doing? \\n\\njerry: just checking it out. look at how this thing is made. can i tell you something? that\\'s a hell of a piece of equipment. \\n\\njodi: actually, i should get a new one. \\n\\njerry: no, nonsense. this one\\'s fine. (as he sits on the table) \\n\\njodi: so, where do you wanna go? (as she puts her hand on his shoulder) \\n\\njerry: go? why go anywhere? (as he places his hand over hers. she starts to massage his shoulders a little) ahh, that feels good. yeah. that\\'s, uh... that\\'s good. (he tries to go further. he grabs her hands over his shoulders and he lies down on the table on his chest) yeah, that\\'s nice. that\\'s very nice. \\n\\njodi: (she stops massaging) no. no, this isn\\'t good. i can\\'t do this. \\n\\njerry: why, what\\'s wrong? (he grabs her hands and force her to keep them on his shoulders) \\n\\njodi: i can\\'t (she tries harder to pull her hands away) \\n\\njerry: no. yes you can. (he hangs on) \\n\\njodi: no, i can\\'t! \\n\\njerry: come on! i know it\\'s something you wanna do! (she pulls harder and he falls right off the table) \\n\\n[setting: karen\\'s place] \\n\\ngeorge: you know what? i should really go talk to her. nothing confrontational. just two adults sitting down trying to clear the air. you know, i just know if i could spend some time alone with her. i\\'ve got to. (he grabs his jacket) i\\'ve got to. \\n\\nkaren: you\\'re going now? \\n\\ngeorge: i think i can still catch her. \\n\\nkaren: all right george. i have had just about enough of this. \\n\\ngeorge: what? what are you talking about. \\n\\nkaren: i am talking about you and jodi. you\\'re completely obsessed with her! \\n\\ngeorge: i know. i know. \\n\\nkaren: who is more important to you, her or me? i like you, she doesn\\'t. who are you gonna pick? \\n\\ngeorge: (he thinks a little about it... and as he puts his hand on his knee and gets up) i\\'m sorry karen. i know i care for you, but i just can\\'t stand when someone doesn\\'t like me. (he opens the door) \\n\\nkaren: well, now i hate you! \\n\\ngeorge: that i\\'m used to. (he leaves) \\n\\n[setting: back to elaine\\'s place] \\n\\njoel: ned? \\n\\nelaine: what is wrong with ned? \\n\\njoel: ned\\'s a guy who buys irregular underwear. next! \\n\\nelaine: ellis. \\n\\njoel: ellis?! you might as well go with alex. it\\'s the same thing! \\n\\nelaine: ellis and alex aren\\'t even close. \\n\\njoel: next! \\n\\nelaine: ohh, what is the point? \\n\\njoel: no, no. come on! \\n\\nelaine: o.k. o.k. remy. \\n\\njoel: remy rifkin? should i get a beret? \\n\\nelaine: oh, stuart\\'s a lot better! (talking like a baby) little stuart rifkin likes to go shopping with his mother. \\n\\njoel: grrrr! \\n\\n[setting: back to jerry\\'s] \\n\\njerry: what do you mean, no? \\n\\njodi: no means no. \\n\\njerry: look, who are you kidding? you come up to my apartment with your table and your little oils, and i\\'m not supposed to expect anything? you\\'re a massage teaser. \\n\\njodi: listen. i massage who i want, when i want. i don\\'t submit to forcible massage. (he tries desperately to get her hands on his shoulders again but she pulls them away immediately) i\\'m getting out of here. \\n\\njerry: fine. go. \\n\\ngeorge: jerry, could you excuse us for a few minutes, please? \\n\\njerry: what for? \\n\\ngeorge: we need to talk. \\n\\njerry: you need to talk? \\n\\njodi: we have nothing to talk about. \\n\\ngeorge: look it\\'s no secret what\\'s going on between us. (to jerry) she doesn\\'t like me. now jerry if you don\\'t mind. \\n\\njerry: george, anything you have to say to her, you can say in front of me. \\n\\ngeorge: (he makes a sign to jodi to wait and turns to jerry) jerry... this woman hates me so much. i\\'m starting to like her. \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\ngeorge: she just dislikes me so much... it\\'s irresistable. \\n\\njerry: i can see that. \\n\\njodi: i\\'m getting out of here. (to jerry) don\\'t call me. \\n\\njerry: don\\'t worry. (she leaves) \\n\\ngeorge: a woman that hates me this much comes along once in a lifetime. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re a lucky guy. \\n\\ngeorge: i got to go after her. \\n\\njerry: george. i wouldn\\'t push for the massage. (george nods) \\n\\ngeorge: jodi! (he starts running after her) \\n\\njerry: the swedish are very big massagers. you know? they like the swedish meatballs, swedish massage. they like having meat in their hands these people, for some reason. but it\\'s weird because they have the highest suicide rate, they\\'re rubbing each other\\'s necks all the time for a neutral country they seem kinda tense. i don\\'t really like the idea of getting a professional massage. i don\\'t want people touching me that don\\'t know me and don\\'t want to have sex with me. you know what are you bothering me for? you get me all loosened up, juices flowing, and then that\\'s it ok, you\\'re done. it\\'s like having chocolate rubbed all over your face, you know you wanna go \"excuse me, i think you missed a spot.\" \\n\\njerry: you can always tell what was the best year of your father\\'s life, because they seem to just freeze that clothing style and just ride it out to the end, don\\'t they? and it\\'s not like they don\\'t continue shopping, it\\'s just they somehow manage to find new old clothes. every father is like this fashion time capsule, you know what i mean. it\\'s like they should be on a pedestal, with someone next to \\'em going \\'this was nineteen sixty-five\\'. to me the worst thing is shopping for pants. i hate dressing and undressing in that little room. what men need is a place to shop where you go in, you check your pants at the door, and you just walk around the store in your underwear. that would be the best way. then you\\'d really have to lie to the salesman. \\'need some help?\\' \\'no, just getting some air.\\' \\n\\njerry: how would you describe the smell in this house? \\n\\nelaine: (sniffing) dandruff? \\n\\njerry: yeah, that\\'s part of it. (sniffs) kasha? \\n\\nelaine: there\\'s some kasha. \\n\\njerry: yeah. dandruff, kasha, mothballs, cheap carpeting. it\\'s pot pourri, really. \\n\\nelaine: alright, let\\'s go, come on. \\n\\ngeorge: wha... you\\'re going? \\n\\nelaine: yeah. you know we shouldn\\'t have bowled that last game, i\\'m gonna be late. \\n\\nkramer: egh. these aren\\'t candies. \\n\\ngeorge: wha? did you use those? these are guest soaps! (he grabs the soaps and begins examining them for damage) \\n\\nkramer: well i\\'m a guest. \\n\\ngeorge: now my parents are gonna know i had people over. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re not allowed to have people over? \\n\\ngeorge: i can\\'t have any parties while they\\'re out of town. (he leaves to return the soaps) \\n\\nkramer: what, this is a party? \\n\\nelaine: not any more. come on, get your ball, we\\'re leaving. let\\'s go, let\\'s go. \\n\\ngeorge: (yells) wow! who put this cup right on the new table! \\n\\njerry: (picks it up) i was having coffee, i put it on the coffee table. \\n\\ngeorge: but you didn\\'t use a coaster, jerry, you left a stain! (he runs to kitchen) \\n\\nkramer: whoah boy. there\\'s always one at every party, huh? \\n\\nelaine: (impatient) come on! \\n\\njerry: what\\'s the big rush? \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m having people over. \\n\\njerry: who? \\n\\nelaine: the girls for poker night. you know, joanne, renee, winona... \\n\\njerry: eh, eh, ah. winona\\'s gonna be there? \\n\\nelaine: yeah. and she broke up with the vitamin guy. \\n\\njerry: (interested) really? \\n\\nelaine: i\\'ll put in a good word for you. \\n\\njerry: thanks, because i would really like... (distractedly puts coffee cup back on the table) \\n\\ngeorge: (screaming) aaahh!! \\n\\njerry: alright, i\\'m sorry. i\\'m sorry. (picks it up again) \\n\\ngeorge: but jerry, this is not coming out! \\n\\njerry: just put a coffee table book over it. \\n\\ngeorge: my parents don\\'t read! they\\'re gonna wonder what a book is doing on the table! \\n\\nkramer: hey, hey, hey, hey. you know what would make a great coffee table book? a coffee table book about coffee tables! get it? \\n\\nelaine: got it! c\\'mon, let\\'s go, let\\'s go. bye george. \\n\\ngeorge: wait, wait wait, not so fast. jerry, you gotta take me to get this thing refinished. \\n\\nelaine: now?! \\n\\ngeorge: yes, now. it\\'s gonna take a few days and my parents are gonna be back. i gotta have it back before them! \\n\\nelaine: jerry, you promised you\\'d get me home by seven. \\n\\nkramer: alright, we\\'ll take the subway. \\n\\njerry: there you go. that\\'ll get you home in time. \\n\\nelaine: oh! the subway? from queens? \\n\\ngeorge: alright, jerry, i\\'m gonna get my coat. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m sorry elaine, i\\'ll make it up to you. \\n\\nelaine: i need something to read on the subway. \\n\\njerry: (handing her a magazine) here, read this. \\n\\nelaine: (looks at it) tv guide? \\n\\nkramer: like a history of coffee tables, celebrities and their coffee tables. it\\'s a natural. this is a story that must be told. \\n\\nelaine: (engrossed in magazine) hmm-mmm. \\n\\nkramer: so, you\\'re gonna talk to your boss about it, huh? \\n\\nelaine: (still paying no attention) hmm-mmm. first thing in the morning. \\n\\nkramer: (claps hands) yes indeed. \\n\\ntannoy (v.o.): next stop, queensboro plaza. \\n\\nkramer: oh, queensboro plaza.

(gives a big grin) \\n\\njerry: i was always excited as a kid, when that new tv guide would come. somehow when that front cover\\'s nice and flat, seems like there\\'s good fresh tv shows in. then, as the weeks go by you start to hate the tv guide. all the shows stink. everything\\'s getting all crumpled and ripped from being sat on, thrown across the room. tv guide is always thrown, never handed, to another person. it\\'s the world\\'s most thrown reading material. \\'where\\'s tv guide?\\' (mimes throwing) \\'there it is.\\' you know in the back of the tv guide, they have a phone number, ninety-five cents a minute, they will give you the answers to the tv guide crossword puzzle? my question is, if you can\\'t do the tv guide crossword puzzle, where are you coming across ninety-five cents? \\n\\njerry: you know doctor is supposed to be such a prestigious occupation. but its really like one of the only jobs where you have to have your diploma right up there on the wall. it makes them seem so insecure, doesnt it? \"i really am a doctor you know. you think im not, just check it out.\" i dont know why they need these little bits of psychological leverage over us all the time. \"go in that little room, take your pants off, wait 15 minutes, and ill give you my opinion.\" after that, anyone that comes in with pants on seems like they know what theyre talking about. in any difference of opinion, pants always beats no-pants. \\n\\ngeorge: can i say one word to you? lobster. the lobster here is unbelievable.

(takes a drag on the cigarette) \\n\\nhotel clerk: well you can wait for them outside. \\n\\ncorinne: yeah, (she blows smoke out as she speaks -- it rises as in front of her) i guess i\\'d better. i wouldn\\'t want to take any attention away from the hookers! \\n\\nhotel clerk: all right, all right. out, out. \\n\\ncorinne: whatever you say, cro..w-well! \\n\\ndiane: what\\'s going on over here? \\n\\nwoman at beach: there is a beached whale, she\\'s dying. \\n\\nvoice: is anyone here a marine biologist? \\n\\ntestikov: here is latest draft. i see you next week. same time, same day. (smacks the manuscript into elaines hand) on time please. \\n\\nelaine: (quietly) ok. \\n\\njerry: it was nice meeting you \\n\\ntestikov: aah. \\n\\njerry: youre a real pleasure. (jerry is being sarcastic) \\n\\ntestikov: ya ya. (wipes his nose with a handkerchief) \\n\\nelaine: uh-oh-ah, by the way mr. testikov um, do you remember the other day when we were in the limo and ah, my organizer started making noise and you threw it out the window? \\n\\ntestikov: (quietly) yes. how could i forget? heehe. \\n\\nelaine: ( laughs) well um, would you believe that it actually, hit somebody in the head. \\n\\njerry: right in the head! (leans in and points at testikov) \\n\\nelaine: boing! hehe hehe. (makes a hand gesture to her forehead and away) \\n\\ntestikov: (shouting) what is that noise! \\n\\nelaine: oh thats nothing. um and anyway um \\n\\ntestikov: whats going on huh! (he grabs elaines purse) that noise! \\n\\nelaine: no, no that\\'s my purse! \\n\\ntestikov: that noise! \\n\\nelaine: no, get-get off my purse! \\n\\ntestikov: agh, its recorder! \\n\\nelaine: no that\\'s radio! \\n\\ntestikov: ha! (he clicks the player off) you are spying on me! \\n\\ncrowd: come on! save the whale! you gotta do it! \\n\\ndiane: save the whale george... for me. \\n\\ngeorge: so i started to walk into the water. i won\\'t lie to you boys, i was terrified! but i pressed on -- and as i made my way passed the breakers a strange calm came over me. i-i don\\'t know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but i tell you jerry at that moment  i was a marine biologist! \\n\\nelaine: george ive just reading this thing in the paper, it\\'s unbelievable! \\n\\ngeorge: i know i was just telling them the story. \\n\\nkramer: well come on george, finish the story. \\n\\ngeorge: the sea was angry that day my friends like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli! \\n\\ngeorge: i got about fifty-feet out and suddenly, the great beast appeared before me. i tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a foot. as if sensing my presence he let out a great bellow. i said, \"easy big fella!\" and then, as i watched him struggling i realized, that something was obstructing its breathing. from where i was standing i could see directly into the eye of the great fish! \\n\\njerry: mammal. \\n\\ngeorge: whatever. \\n\\nkramer: well then, what did you do next? \\n\\ngeorge: well then, from out of nowhere, a huge tidal wave lifted me, tossed like a cork and i found myself right on top of him, (elaine gasps quietly ahhhh) face to face with the blow-hole. i-i, i could barely see from the waves crashing down upon me but, i knew something was there so i reached my hand in, felt around and pulled out the obstruction! \\n\\nkramer: what is that a titleist? \\n\\ngeorge: (silently squinches his mouth and nods at kramer) \\n\\nkramer: a hole in one eh. \\n\\njerry: well the-the crowd must have gone wild! \\n\\ngeorge: ohh yes, yes. yes jerry they were all over me. it was like rocky 1, hm. diane came up to me, threw her arms around me \\n\\nkramer: (quietly) um-hm. \\n\\ngeorge: kissed me. we both had tears streaming down our faces. i never saw anyone so beautiful. it was at that moment that i decided to tell her that, i was not a marine biologist. \\n\\njerry: wow! what\\'d she say? \\n\\ngeorge: told me to \"go to hell!\" and i took the bus home. \\n\\njerry: all right lets go. \\n\\nelaine: what, are you in a bad mood? \\n\\njerry: ahhh got my laundry back. \\n\\nelaine: ohhh! golden boy? \\n\\njerry: he didn\\'t make it. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m sorry. (pats him on the arm) \\n\\njerry: yea. (pulls at the t-shirt) this is golden boy\\'s son baby blue. \\n\\nkramer: (to george) what\\'s with you? \\n\\ngeorge: sand. it\\'s everywhere \\n\\nkramer: yep. \\n\\njerry: aren\\'t mannequins an insult to your imagination? you couldn\\'t possibly visualize a sweater so we\\'ll show you on this life size snotty puppet. i guess when they finish with them they become crash test dummies. that\\'s the end of the line for a mannequin. \"what ever happened to bob?\" \"have you seen that new volvo commercial? he\\'s got a bulls eye right in his face.\" mannequins are only used for car accidents and fashion, i guess these are the two situations that it\\'s impossible for us to imagine ourselves. well dressed or getting killed. i\\'m sure there is some pro-mannequin organization that doesn\\'t even like you to use the term mannequin. \"hey they\\'re not mannequins, they\\'re the life deprived.\" \\n\\naudrey: hum! that was really good! \\n\\njerry: yeah. are you full? \\n\\naudrey: oh no, i\\'ve had just enough. \\n\\njerry: ah, here we go... apple pie! best apple pie in the city. (jerry starts eating) mmm, delicious. i\\'m not waiting for you. take some. \\n\\naudrey: no thanks. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re not gonna have any? \\n\\naudrey: no (with a disgusted face) \\n\\njerry: do you not like apple pie? \\n\\naudrey: no, it\\'s not that. \\n\\njerry: well, at least taste it. \\n\\naudrey: no (a resolute \"no\") \\n\\njerry: you won\\'t even taste it? \\n\\naudrey: no. \\n\\njerry: come on, try it! (audrey shakes her head doing \"no\") a little taste! (still shaking) come on. (still shaking) \\n\\njerry: she wouldn\\'t so much as taste it. \\n\\ngeorge: did she say why? \\n\\njerry: no. she wouldn\\'t say anything. she just kept shaking her head like this (imitating audrey) \\n\\ngeorge: maybe she\\'s diabetic. \\n\\njerry: no. she carries entemanns doughnuts in her purse. \\n\\ngeorge: maybe you said something that offended her. \\n\\njerry: the only thing i can think of is i told her we should have those moving walkways all over the city. \\n\\ngeorge: like at the airport? (getting excited) \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s a great idea!!! \\n\\njerry: tell me about it! \\n\\ngeorge: we could be zipping all over the place. \\n\\njerry: they could at least try it. \\n\\ngeorge: they never try anything. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s the harm? \\n\\ngeorge: no harm! \\n\\njerry: (still talking to george) i\\'m sorry. there\\'s no reason for her not to taste that pie. \\n\\nelaine: who wouldn\\'t taste a pie? \\n\\njerry: audrey. \\n\\nelaine: dump her. \\n\\njerry: boy, i never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie??? \\n\\nelaine: (piffling) i once broke up with someone for not offering me pie. \\n\\njerry: you did? \\n\\nelaine: he could be eating a gyro, he wouldn\\'t offer me anything. it\\'s a sickness. \\n\\ngeorge: well, i can\\'t walk anywhere now. i\\'m just gonna be wishing there were walkways. (seeing elaine removing her shoe) what are you doing? \\n\\nelaine: i got a pebble. \\n\\njerry: boy, i never heard of that happening to a woman? \\n\\nelaine: what the hell does that mean? \\n\\nkramer: hey! elaine. go like this. (imitating a mannequin posture) \\n\\nelaine: what? why? \\n\\nkramer: do it. do it. this. \\n\\nelaine: like... (doing it) like this? \\n\\nkramer: oh yeah! it\\'s you! \\n\\nelaine: what\\'s me? \\n\\nkramer: (to the gang) there\\'s a clothing store downtown. they got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like elaine. \\n\\nelaine: get out! \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s uncanny! it\\'s like they chopped off your arms and legs, dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together again, and stuck you on a pedestal. it\\'s really quite exquisite. \\n\\ngeorge: kramer, what\\'s the name of the store with the mannequin? \\n\\nkramer: rinitze. (he takes jerry\\'s spatula and starts rubbing his back with it) oh yeah... \\n\\njerry: (to kramer) uh... may i help you? (wondering what the hell\\'s kramer doing) \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s this itch. i was watching tv without my shirt on, and one my couch cushions didn\\'t have any fabric on it. \\n\\ngeorge: wait a minute, rinitze? don\\'t they have somme really cool suits in there? \\n\\nkramer: real boss! \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m going down there. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m gonna go with you. i gotta get a new suit. i got a second interview with mackenzie, and i think i\\'m really close. they\\'re all taking me out to lunch on friday. \\n\\nelaine: (grabbing george by the arm, hurried to leave) let\\'s go. \\n\\ngeorge: all right. all right. (they both leave) \\n\\nkramer: (leaving too, with the spatula) are you gonna need this? \\n\\njerry: keep it. (implied please) \\n\\nelaine: it looks exactly like me. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s like some pod landed from another planet and took your body. don\\'t fall asleep elaine. \\n\\nelaine: what\\'s going on here? how do you think this happened? \\n\\ngeorge: whoa, look at this. this is a beautiful suit. huh? \\n\\nelaine: you think that could be a coincidence george? is that possible? \\n\\nsaleswoman: (european accent) you are perfect for that suit. \\n\\ngeorge: you think so? \\n\\nelaine: (to the saleswoman) excuse me. where did this come from? \\n\\nsaleswoman: i don\\'t know. \\n\\ngeorge: you really think this looks o.k. on me? \\n\\nsaleswoman: fabulous. perfect fit. and it\\'s the last one we have. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m sorry. you can\\'t tell me where the mannequin came from? \\n\\nsaleswoman: i told you, i don\\'t know. \\n\\nelaine: (irritated, but still polite) well, is there somebody around here i could talk to who would know? \\n\\nsaleswoman: why? \\n\\nelaine: isn\\'t it obvious? this mannequin looks exactly like me. \\n\\nelaine: (upset) did you just roll your eyes at him? because let me tell you something, if anobody should be rolling their eyes, it is me at him about you. \\n\\nsaleswoman: i think maybe you\\'re flattering yourself. that mannquein is wearing a twelve hundred dollar gaultier dress. \\n\\nelaine: what are you saying, that i\\'m not good enough for this hideous dress? (looking at her name tag) listen natasha... i wouldn\\'t be caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags. (to george) i\\'ll meet you outside. \\n\\nsaleswoman: what is her problem? \\n\\ngeorge: ah, pfft! what can you do? (looking at a tag on the suit) is this the price tag? \\n\\nsaleswoman: yes. \\n\\ngeorge: yes, hello. party\\'s over. (taking off the suit) \\n\\nsaleswoman: i\\'ll tell you a little secret. we\\'re having an unadvertised sale starting friday, that suit will be half-price. \\n\\ngeorge: so you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me? \\n\\nsaleswoman: oh, i\\'m afraid i could\\'t do that. it wouldn\\'t be fair to the other customers. \\n\\ngeorge: oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair. (placing the suit further away in the rack) \\n\\nelaine: so, i found out who supplies the mannequins and i called \\'em up. \\n\\nkramer: well, how did they get your face? \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t know. they wouldn\\'t tell me. (jerry is not listening, he\\'s looking at two women sitting in the other booth) jerry? je... hello? \\n\\njerry: (jerry gets up and walk to these persons) uh... excuse me. i couldn\\'t help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie. \\n\\nwoman 1: that\\'s right. \\n\\njerry: and you waved it away. \\n\\nwoman 2: right. \\n\\njerry: did you give her a reason? \\n\\nwoman 2: yes, i was full. \\n\\njerry: you were full. so you gave a reason. you didn\\'t just shake your head. \\n\\nwoman 2: no, i\\'m not a psycho. \\n\\njerry: exactly. you\\'re not a psycho. you\\'ve been very helpful. thank you very much. allow me to leave the tip. (sits back with elaine and kramer) well, i think we proven who the psycho is. \\n\\nelaine: we certainly have. \\n\\nkramer: hey, elaine scratch my back. \\n\\nelaine: no way! \\n\\nkramer: come on, one lap around. \\n\\nelaine: no. \\n\\nkramer: it will be a funky adventure. \\n\\nelaine: kramer, forget it. \\n\\nkramer: jerry, how about you? \\n\\njerry: i think you know my policy. \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m going home to spatula. (picks up the check and walks to the cashier) \\n\\nelaine: i thought george was meeting us here? \\n\\njerry: no he\\'s going downtown to guard the suit. \\n\\nelaine: he\\'s guarding a suit? \\n\\nolive: (the cashier; to kramer) do you need some help with that itch? \\n\\nkramer: madam, i pray you\\'re not toying with me. (olive shows her long finger nails) whoa. \\n\\nolive: turn around. \\n\\nkramer: oh, all right. (olive scratches, kramer enjoys, elaine and jerry watch.) \\n\\nsaleswoman: (makes a guy trying the suit) it fits you perfectly. \\n\\nbob: you think so? (she nods and walks away) \\n\\ngeorge: (outside, looking the guy trying the suit through the window, and thinking out loud) what\\'s this? can\\'t i leave this place for a second? (goes in, take off his jacket, walks to the guy and talks to him with an european accent) can i help you? \\n\\nbob: i\\'m buying the suit. \\n\\ngeorge: no, no, no, this suit is not for sale. (tries to take off the suit from the guy) \\n\\nbob: excuse me, do you work here? \\n\\ngeorge: (leaving the european accent) no. (laughs) \\n\\nbob: then what the hell business is it of yours? \\n\\ngeorge: look, i\\'m doing you a favor. they\\'re having an unadvertised sale. this suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... monday. \\n\\nbob: really? \\n\\ngeorge: yea yea yea \\n\\nbob: this monday? \\n\\ngeorge: yes. now take off those pants. \\n\\nsaleswoman: actually, the unadvertised sale starts on friday. \\n\\nbob: friday? thanks. (gives a dirty look at george and leaves) \\n\\ngeorge: (to the saleswoman) you know honey for an unadvertised sale, you\\'re doing a lot of yapping about it. \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t beleive your father owns this place. so how are the desserts here? \\n\\naudrey: everything is delicious. \\n\\njerry: you\\'ve tasted them? \\n\\naudrey: um-hmm, i think almost all of them. \\n\\njerry: oh i see they have apple pie. \\n\\naudrey: mmm-hmm. \\n\\njerry: you\\'ve had the apple pie? \\n\\naudrey: many times. \\n\\njerry: audrey, i got to be honest with you. i\\'m a very curious guy. it\\'s my nature. i need to know things. not tasting the apple pie the other day, i can\\'t get past it. you obviously like pies. you carry doughnuts in your bag, you\\'re not averse to pastry. surely you could see how such a thing would prey on my mind. \\n\\naudrey: can we drop this? \\n\\njerry: (like a frustrated child) why can\\'t i know? \\n\\naudrey: ah! poppie. \\n\\npoppie: sweetheart, hello. \\n\\naudrey: poppie, this is jerry. \\n\\npoppie: welcome (shakes jerry\\'s hand) \\n\\njerry: hello poppie. \\n\\npoppie: don\\'t fill up on the bread. i\\'m making you a very special dinner. very special. (he leaves) \\n\\njerry: the pies. i\\'m going to the bathroom. you know. (he leaves) \\n\\n[poppie\\'s restaurant: bathroom] \\n\\npoppie: ah, jerry! tonight you in for a real treat. i\\'m personnaly going to prepare the dinner for you and my audrey. \\n\\naudrey: jerry are you ok? \\n\\njerry: huh? \\n\\naudrey: is anything wrong? \\n\\njerry: no, nothing. \\n\\naudrey: you look like you\\'ve seen a ghost. \\n\\nolive: (to another cashier) i\\'ll see you tomorrow. \\n\\nkramer: hey. these are for you olive. \\n\\nolive: thank you. \\n\\nkramer: ohh! \\n\\npoppie: here it is. \\n\\naudrey: wait till you taste this.

(not very interested) \\n\\nelaine: there\\'s this blind guy at a party i was at, and he felt my face for a really long time. you know, to see what i looked like. he almost put his finger up my nose. \\n\\njerry: (very disinterested) hum... ok, what else you got? \\n\\nelaine: ok, i\\'m not gonna tell you the rest of the list. \\n\\njerry: oh, because i didn\\'t think the blind guy did it? \\n\\nelaine: because you have an attitude. \\n\\njerry and elaine: oh! \\n\\njerry: georgio! nice duds! \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'re telling me. (he walks around and the suit makes a swooshing sound) so, what do you think? \\n\\njerry: did you hear something? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, like a swoosh. \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\nelaine: (feels the fabric) it must be the fabric. it\\'s rubbing between you thighs when you walk. that\\'s what\\'s making that swooshy sound. \\n\\ngeorge: i probably didn\\'t hear it on the way over because of the street noise. (he panics) this is no good! i got to meet these guys from mackenzie for lunch in half an hour! \\n\\njerry: so what? what would they care? \\n\\ngeorge: this mackenzie, he\\'s a bit of a nut. someone told me he fired the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed. \\n\\njerry: so you think you\\'re not gonna get the job because your pants make a noise? \\n\\ngeorge: let\\'s say it comes down to me and one other guy. he\\'s got a nice quiet suit, and i\\'m whooshing all over the place! who do you think he\\'s gonna hire? \\n\\njerry: you know, i think all these interviews are making you nuts. \\n\\nkramer: hey jerry, i saw your girlfriend was in here before. \\n\\njerry: audrey? \\n\\nkramer: yep. sat down, had herself a piece of pie. \\n\\njerry: was it apple? \\n\\nkramer: what else? \\n\\njerry: this woman is bending my mind into a pretzel! \\n\\nstranger: do i know you? \\n\\nelaine: hmm... no you don\\'t. \\n\\nstranger: yeah! you were wearing a g-string and one of those bras with points. \\n\\nelaine: the mannequin! \\n\\njerry: oh, i got to see this thing. \\n\\njerry: boy, the resemblance is uncanny. \\n\\nelaine: you think you can pose me however you want? that\\'s my ass in your window! \\n\\nsaleswoman: it\\'s our store and our mannequin, we can do whatever we want with it. \\n\\nelaine: no! you take that mannequin down right now, or i\\'m pressing charges.

(mackenzie stops talking and walking, george too) did you hear something? \\n\\ngeorge: no, i didn\\'t hear anything. \\n\\nmackenzie: huh, that\\'s strange. (they start walking again) it\\'s quieter here. we can concentrate without people wooshing around... (he stops again, george too) that sound again. sure you didn\\'t hear anything? \\n\\ngeorge: no, can\\'t say as i did. \\n\\nmackenzie: kind of like a... rustling. \\n\\ngeorge: could be the leaves... \\n\\naudrey: that\\'s right. poppie\\'s on 77th. ok we\\'ll see you at 800. bye-bye. \\n\\njerry: hello. \\n\\naudrey: what are you doing here? \\n\\njerry: so how was the pie? \\n\\naudrey: what pie? \\n\\njerry: the apple pie you had today at monks \\n\\naudrey: i\\'m very busy here. \\n\\njerry: pretty good, wasn\\'it? i told you you should\\'ve tasted it. \\n\\naudrey: you better not let poppie see you here. \\n\\nhealth inspector: all right, i\\'m looking for someone named poppie. \\n\\naudrey: uh, who are you? \\n\\nhealth inspector: board of health, we\\'ve had several complaints. \\n\\njerry: oh, about the... uh (jerry pretend to wash his hands) \\n\\nhealth inspector: are you poppie? \\n\\npoppie: i\\'m poppie. \\n\\nhealth inspector: i think you\\'d better come with me. \\n\\npoppie: what\\'s the problem? \\n\\naudrey: what do they want from poppie? \\n\\njerry: well, poppie\\'s a little sloppy. \\n\\nmackenzie: you taught i\\'d care about your pants wooshing? \\n\\ngeorge: i heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted. \\n\\nmackenzie: no, no, no. he got fired because he wasn\\'t a team player. that\\'s something we don\\'t joke about at mackenzie. you\\'ll find we\\'re team here george. we don\\'t tolerate dissent. if you want to go your own way, you\\'re in the wrong place. \\n\\ngeorge: no problem there. conformity is an obsession with me. \\n\\nwaiter: chocolate cream pie. compliments of the house. \\n\\nmackenzie: oh! hope you saved room for dessert. \\n\\nwaiter: (to george) the chef said that he made it special for you. \\n\\ngeorge: oh...

(turns back to jerry) jerry give me the keys. (jerry throws his keys to kramer) well, i guess we\\'re gonna go for a drive now. she really loves that. \\n\\ngeorge: did you ever solve the riddle of the pie? \\n\\njerry: no. that\\'s one for the ages. but i think they\\'re gonna put poppie away for a long long time. \\n\\nelaine: you guys are not gonna believe this. i just got a letter from a friend of mine in chicago who was shopping, and she said she saw a mannequin that looked just like me. what if there\\'re more. where are they coming from? \\n\\nricky\\'s boss: ricky, we\\'ve been getting a tremendous response to your tr-6 mannequin. \\n\\nricky: tr-6? i prefer to think of her as... elaine. \\n\\n[setting: comedy club] \\n\\nopening monolog: the bus is the single stupidest, fattest, slowest, most despised vehicle on the road. isn\\'t it? you ever notice when you get behind the bus, people in your car go \\'what are you doing? get away, come on.\\' the back of the bus is like an eclipse isn\\'t it? people are just like \\'the sun, where\\'s the sun?\\' it\\'s like this huge metal ass taking up the whole wind shield of your car. when it pulls out it even sounds like a fat uncle trying to get out of a sofa. (acts like he is trying to get out of a car and makes the sound of a bus/guy starting to get going) \\n\\n[setting: jerry and george on a bus] \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s just not good, it\\'s not good. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s not good. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m bored. she\\'s boring, i\\'m boring, we\\'re both boring. we got out to eat, we both read newspapers. \\n\\njerry: well at breakfast everybody reads. \\n\\ngeorge: no. lunch we read, dinner we read. \\n\\njerry: you read during lunch? \\n\\ngeorge: ya \\n\\njerry: oh, well. \\n\\ngeorge: there\\'s nothing to talk about. \\n\\njerry: ya, what\\'s there to talk about. \\n\\ngeorge: well at least you and i are talking about how there\\'s nothing to talk about. \\n\\njerry: why don\\'t you talk to her about how there\\'s nothing to talk about? \\n\\ngeorge: she knows there is nothing to talk about. \\n\\njerry: at least you\\'ll be talking. \\n\\ngeorge: oh shut up. \\n\\nal: hey, look who\\'s here. \\n\\njerry: hey, al. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, al. how\\'s it going? \\n\\nal: (extremely happy) deeply in love. we have soo many things to talk about. sometimes we\\'ll talk all night, till the sun comes up (pauses in his happiness; to george) so how about you? \\n\\ngeorge: oh i\\'m seeing someone, yes. you know her, daphne bower. \\n\\nal: great girl. \\n\\ngeorge: we have no need to speak. we communicate with deep soulful looks. \\n\\njerry: like dwight and mamie eisenhower. \\n\\nal: (to jerry) oh did you hear about fulton? \\n\\njerry: ya. \\n\\nal: i went by the hospital to see him a few days ago (looking at jerry) think he\\'d really like you to come visit. \\n\\njerry: me? \\n\\nal: ya, he said he could use a good laugh. \\n\\ngeorge: what about me? \\n\\nal: (to george) he didn\\'t mention you. (looks toward the front of the bus) this is my stop. uh see ya. \\n\\ngeorge: ya \\n\\njerry: ya, see ya. \\n\\ngeorge: deeply in love. if you can\\'t say anything bad about a relationship, you shouldn\\'t say anything at all. \\n\\njerry: (points to george) ya. \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\ngeorge: i didn\\'t even know fulton was in the hospital. \\n\\njerry: could use a good laugh. you know what kind of pressure that is? come on, come with me. \\n\\ngeorge: na no, i\\'m not good in these situations. i can\\'t hide my pity. i..i make em feel worse. \\n\\njerry: oh, stop it. \\n\\ngeorge: ya and also i\\'m afraid that people in that state are finally going to tell me what they really think of me. you know they got nothing to lose what do they care? \\n\\njerry: so you\\'re not gonna come? \\n\\ngeorge: no but say hello for me. \\n\\nkramer: hey! \\n\\njerry: hey! hey mick. \\n\\nmickey: hey jerry. \\n\\nkramer: what\\'s doing? \\n\\njerry: nothing, what\\'s doing with you? \\n\\nkramer: same old, same old. \\n\\njerry: george this is mickey. \\n\\ngeorge: hi, nice to meet you. \\n\\nmickey: pleasure. \\n\\njerry: how\\'s work going you guys? \\n\\nmickey: lets not even talk about it. \\n\\ngeorge: (to kramer) you got a job? \\n\\nkramer: ya, mickey. he hooked me up. we\\'re stand-ins for the actors on \\'all my children.\\' mickey, he\\'s a stand-in for an eight year old kid and i stand in for the kids father. \\n\\nmickey: (to jerry then both jerry and george) but i got a big problem. the kid i stand in for, he\\'s growing. he was four feet last month, now he\\'s like four-two and a half. he shot up two and a half inches. i can do four-two, four-three is a stretch, any higher than that and i\\'m gonna be out on my ass doing that para-legal crap. \\n\\njerry: how do you stop a kid from growing? \\n\\nkramer: (to mickey) i told you, you should offer him some cigarettes. \\n\\nmickey: i offered him cigarettes, (to jerry and george) but his stupid mother is hanging around. she won\\'t let him have any. \\n\\nkramer: (to mickey) what about lifts? \\n\\nmickey: (to kramer) out of the question. \\n\\ngeorge: (to mickey) can\\'t you just switch with another midget? \\n\\nmickey: (turns and moves up to george, points his finger at him) it\\'s little people, you got that? \\n\\nkramer: easy mickey, easy. \\n\\ngeorge: yap.. \\n\\nkramer: alright we gotta get back to the show. what are you guys doing? \\n\\njerry: i\\'m going to the hospital, to visit fulton. \\n\\nkramer: (on his way to the door) oh, oh well say hello for me. \\n\\nkramer: now look, we\\'re going to stop at the shoe maker right now. you gotta get some lifts for your shoes. \\n\\nmickey: lifts?! look kramer you don\\'t understand, this kind of thing is just not done. \\n\\nkramer: you wanna keep your job don\\'t you? \\n\\nmickey: ya but.. \\n\\nkramer: yah! no buts \\n\\nmickey: kramer \\n\\nkramer: (with his hand in mickey\\'s face) yaaaaah! \\n\\njerry: hey, woahoh fulton. it\\'s me. \\n\\nfulton: hey jerry, good to see ya. i could really use a good laugh. \\n\\njerry: who couldn\\'t. \\n\\nfulton: i haven\\'t cracked a smile in months. \\n\\njerry: oh don\\'t worry, you\\'ll crack. cracking\\'s inevitable, first you crack then you chuckle. that was the motto with the russians at the caesar leningrad... first you crack then you chuckle. (fulton looks at him not amused) you know because leningrad when the nazis attacked, it wasn\\'t a very happy time... because of the war, famine, plus it was cold, very cold... they were eating each other. (nervous under the pressure; fulton not finding anything jerry is saying funny) maybe this isn\\'t a good time for a visit. \\n\\nfulton: it\\'s a fine time. \\n\\njerry: oh, alright ah well... there\\'s a priest, a minister and a rabbi, and they\\'re all staring at him.... \\n\\ngeorge: (sets down his paper) so how were the eggs? \\n\\ndaphne: eggs are eggs. \\n\\ngeorge: (not amused with her answer) eggs are eggs. that is very profound.

(daphne shacks her head) what a nerve. how dare he say something like that. \\n\\ndaphne: is it true? \\n\\ngeorge: of course not. i mean sure, there may have been one or two occasions in the past, when i may have reacted in uh impulsive or somewhat immature manner, but those days are well behind me. \\n\\n[setting: abc studios] \\n\\nson: how long are you going to be away for daddy? \\n\\nfather: i\\'m not really going away, i told you, i\\'ll be back every other weekend. \\n\\nson: don\\'t go daddy, don\\'t go. \\n\\nfather: now porter, you know your mother and i love you very much, but sometimes people fall out of love. now give me a big hug. \\n\\ndirector: (walks into the scene) ...and there\\'s your scene. stand-ins \\n\\nkramer: yo \\n\\nstage hand (larry david\\'s voice): alright you guys get on their spots so we can fix the lights. \\n\\nkramer: (taps the father on the shoulder) that\\'s good work. \\n\\nmickey: (quickly with no acting) how long you going to be away for daddy? \\n\\nkramer: (trying to act like the guy playing the father) i\\'m not really going away, i told you i\\'d be back every other weekend. \\n\\nmickey: (tugs on kramer\\'s coat) don\\'t go daddy, don\\'t...go. \\n\\nkramer: now listen porter, you know your mother and i love you very much. but sometimes people fall out of love. now give me a big hug. \\n\\nmickey: ah!

(meryl goes into the other room. kramer staggers in the door in his bathrobe.) \\n\\nkramer: got any coffee? \\n\\njerry: yeah. (kramer lurches into the kitchen, trips, and falls onto the kitchen floor.) i\\'ll get it, i\\'ll get it! take it easy, why are you so tired? \\n\\nkramer: my quilt is still at the cleaners. jerry, i can\\'t sleep without my quilt. like the other night? i was cold. so, last night, i turn up the heat - it\\'s too hot. i open up a window - it\\'s too cold. (frantic) i can\\'t get into a zone! \\n\\njerry: what is that? (points to kramer\\'s pocket as meryl comes back.) \\n\\nkramer: huh? \\n\\njerry: that? \\n\\nkramer: oh, i forgot. (hands back jerry\\'s can opener.) \\n\\njerry: hey, i\\'m sorry about all that can opener stuff. \\n\\nmeryl: yeah, me too. i love you. \\n\\njerry: i love you. \\n\\nmeryl: well, goodnight. \\n\\njerry: goodnight. (they kiss goodnight, then promptly roll away from each other and go to sleep.) \\n\\ngeorge: they could kick me out of the health club if he tells them! \\n\\nelaine: so what do you want me to do? \\n\\ngeorge: talk to him! \\n\\nelaine: how can i do that? \\n\\ngeorge: you said the guy gave you an open-lipped kiss! \\n\\nelaine (enunciating clearly so george gets the point): yes, but then he wiped his hand on the top of the bottle when i offered him water! \\n\\ngeorge: well, that doesn\\'t mean anything! \\n\\nelaine: are you kidding? that\\'s very significant! if he was interested in me, he\\'d want my germs! he\\'d just crave my germs! \\n\\njerry (patiently while watching tv): she\\'s right, george. bottle-wipe is big. \\n\\ngeorge: well, what about the open-lipped kiss? \\n\\njerry: (still watching tv; sounds like basketball) bottle-wipe supercedes it. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, you\\'re right, you\\'re right. (to elaine) alright, maybe he\\'s not interested, but you still know him - can\\'t you just ask him? \\n\\nelaine: george...but if i ask him now, i will have no chance of going out with him. \\n\\ngeorge: why? \\n\\nelaine: i...i don\\'t know... \\n\\ngeorge: aha. aha. could it be because you don\\'t want him to know that you have a friend who pees in the shower, is that it?! \\n\\nelaine: no, that\\'s not it! \\n\\ngeorge: oh, i think it is! i think that\\'s exactly what it is! \\n\\nelaine: why couldn\\'t you just wait? \\n\\ngeorge: i was there! i saw a drain! \\n\\nelaine: since when is a drain a toilet?! \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s all pipes! what\\'s the difference?! \\n\\nelaine: different pipes go to different places! you\\'re gonna mix \\'em up! \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'ll call a plumber right now! (goes for the phone.) \\n\\njerry: alright, can we just drop all the pee-pipe stuff here? \\n\\nelaine (to george): okay! okay! okay, i will talk to him. (kramer enters.) \\n\\nkramer: jerry, i think that quilt is ready. \\n\\njerry: alright. \\n\\nkramer: well, you gotta pick it up for me! \\n\\njerry: alright, i\\'ll pick it up, but it\\'s the last time i\\'m doin\\' it! \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m so tired! \\n\\nelaine (to kramer): boy, you don\\'t look good. \\n\\nkramer: huh? i don\\'t? \\n\\nelaine: no, you look pale. \\n\\nkramer: pale? oh my god...i gotta meet anna\\'s parents today! (the phone rings.) \\n\\njerry: hello? oh, hi honey. (annoyed, weary) yes, i told him. i\\'ll get it. (george and elaine give each other a look, then leave jerry to argue with meryl on the phone.) whenever. okay, i\\'m sorry... \\n\\nmarty: i\\'m sorry, it\\'s not ready yet. (kramer bursts in.) \\n\\nkramer: not ready? it has to be ready! what kind of a business are you running here? \\n\\nmarty: who the hell are you? huh, it\\'s not your quilt. \\n\\njerry: he\\'s a very good friend of mine, he\\'s kind\\'ve like an older brother to me...when things don\\'t go right, he kinda takes it personally. \\n\\nmarty: well, uh...maybe tomorrow. \\n\\nkramer (angrily, to jerry): maybe. \\n\\njerry: oh, it\\'s okay, it\\'ll be okay. \\n\\nkramer: alright, i\\'m gonna see you later. \\n\\njerry: where you goin\\'? \\n\\nkramer: i gotta meet anna\\'s parents today, remember? i look terrible! i\\'m gonna hit the tanning machines. \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t believe you still do that. you know those things are bad for ya. \\n\\nkramer: hey, that\\'s how i maintain my glow. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m goin\\' home. \\n\\nkramer: ya. \\n\\npaula (to marty, in a foreign accent): excuse me? uh, how much would it cost to clean this? \\n\\nmarty: oh, about thirteen dollars. \\n\\npaula: thirteen? well, i can\\'t afford that. \\n\\nmarty: well, i\\'m sorry. \\n\\nelaine: hi, greg. \\n\\ngreg: hey, elaine. i\\'ll be off in a second. \\n\\nelaine: ok. (another guy approaches the exercise machine.) i got the machine next, buddy. (greg finishes up his workout and gets off the machine.) \\n\\ngreg (to elaine): oh, well, it\\'s all yours. (walks away. elaine looks at the machine, then george runs over.) \\n\\ngeorge: what happened? did he bring it up? \\n\\nelaine: never mind that, look at the signal i just got. \\n\\ngeorge: signal? what signal? \\n\\nelaine: lookit. he knew i was gonna use the machine next, he didn\\'t wipe his sweat off. that\\'s a gesture of intimacy. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'ll tell you what that is - that\\'s a violation of club rules. now i got him! and you\\'re my witness! \\n\\nelaine: listen, george! listen! he knew what he was doing, this was a signal. \\n\\ngeorge: a guy leaves a puddle of sweat, that\\'s a signal? \\n\\nelaine: yeah! it\\'s a social thing. \\n\\ngeorge: what if he left you a used kleenex, what\\'s that, a valentine? now you go up to him and you tell him that if he\\'s thinking of turning me in, that i got the goods on him! \\n\\nelaine: no! i won\\'t be a party to this. \\n\\ngeorge: so you\\'re gonna let me get suspended for shower urination? \\n\\nelaine: okay, i\\'ll talk to him. but you\\'re putting me in a very difficult position. (walks away.) \\n\\npaula: i won\\'t let you do this! \\n\\njerry: i want to! \\n\\npaula: but it isn\\'t right! i can\\'t. \\n\\njerry: give me the clothes. \\n\\npaula: jerry, please. what about her? \\n\\njerry: oh, the hell with her. (paula dramatically flees from the coffee shop. jerry thinks for a second, then follows her and catches up to her on the street.) \\n\\npaula: no, jerry, please! \\n\\njerry: i\\'m not gonna let you walk out of my life. \\n\\npaula (hands over the clothes): i can\\'t fight you. (they embrace and kiss passionately.) \\n\\njerry: do you want box or hanger? \\n\\npaula: you decide. (jerry considers.) \\n\\nelaine: you\\'re really working up quite a sweat today, huh? \\n\\ngreg: yeah. (spies the shapely manager of the health club.) oh, there\\'s the manager. good. i think i\\'m gonna talk to her about that guy, you know, we cannot have people like that in here. \\n\\nelaine: are you sure you want to do that? \\n\\ngreg: yeah. he\\'s disgusting! besides, i\\'ll take any chance i can to talk to her. \\n\\nelaine: you\\'re interested in...in her? (points at the manager.) \\n\\ngreg: very. \\n\\nelaine: ah. you know, uh..i\\'m engaged. (preens) yep, gettin\\' married in fifty years. (snaps the straps of her leotard against her chest and winces. george walks by the manager.) \\n\\ngreg: oh good, there he is. i wanna be able to point him out. \\n\\nelaine: you know, greg, i wouldn\\'t do that if i were you. \\n\\ngreg: why? \\n\\nelaine: well, correct me if i\\'m wrong, but isn\\'t it a violation of club policy to not wipe down a machine after using it? \\n\\ngreg: oh, i see...you\\'re friends with the urinator, aren\\'t you? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, well, at least he had a drain. \\n\\nmarty: here you go, mrs. seinfeld...with your 25% discount, it comes to $17.80. \\n\\nmeryl: here you go. (pays marty, then looks at the clothes on the hanger.) excuse me, this isn\\'t mine. \\n\\nmarty: oh, yes it is. your husband brought it in himself. \\n\\nmeryl: really? (takes her change and grabs the clothes off the hanger.) thank you. (exits.) \\n\\nanna: that\\'s him! (opens the door. kramer stands there, deeply tanned and smiling. anna and her grandfather are shocked.) \\n\\nmeryl (throws paula\\'s clothes at jerry): you son of a bitch! \\n\\njerry: i\\'m sorry. \\n\\nmeryl: who is she? i want to know who she is. \\n\\njerry: it doesn\\'t matter. i want a divorce. \\n\\nmeryl: a divorce? oh, so you can marry her and give her the discount? \\n\\njerry: yes, that\\'s right. \\n\\nmeryl: what happened to us, jerry? \\n\\njerry: i\\'ll tell you what happened. we got married. \\n\\nmeryl: i\\'m sorry, uh.. this is my fault. i pushed it on you. \\n\\njerry: no. i guess i just wasn\\'t ready for the responsibilities of a pretend marriage. \\n\\nmeryl: goodbye, jerry. oh, i forgot...(reaches in her purse)...this is your maple syrup. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s alright, i want you to have it. \\n\\nmeryl: (sentimental) okay, thanks. \\n\\njerry: we\\'ll always have...pancakes. \\n\\nmeryl: bye, jerry. (exits.) \\n\\ngrandpa (to anna): i thought you said you was bringin\\' a white boy home! i don\\'t see a white boy! i see a damn fool! \\n\\njerry: you know their timing couldn\\'t be worse. \\n\\ngeorge: is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you? \\n\\njerry: you don\\'t understand, i haven\\'t been together with rachel for like three weeks. first i was on the road, then my parents show up, i\\'m getting a little uh backed up. \\n\\ngeorge: when are they leaving for paris? \\n\\njerry: not for another three days. \\n\\ngeorge: what about her place? \\n\\njerry: she lives with her parents. \\n\\ngeorge: really? (jerry shakes his head) maybe this will become like a cool thing, living with your parents. \\n\\njerry: (sarcastically) ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. this will all be turning your way. \\n\\ngeorge: hey believe me, baldness will catch on. when the aliens come, who do you think they\\'re gonna relate to? who do you think is going to be the first ones getting a tour of the ship? \\n\\njerry: the baldies \\n\\ngeorge: hey by the way my parents really want to have your parents over dinner before they leave town. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s good, then i get the apartment for at least one night. you know i\\'m paying for this whole paris trip it\\'s their anniversary present. \\n\\nalec: (walking over to jerry and george\\'s table) hey guys. \\n\\ngeorge: hey alec \\n\\njerry: hey alec \\n\\nalec: this is joey. \\n\\ngeorge: hey joey, how you doin\\'? \\n\\nalec: (joey was about to talk) hey listen, i was wondering if either one of you guys would be interested in doing some work for the big brother program? i\\'m kinda running the local chapter. what do you say george? \\n\\ngeorge: well uh.... \\n\\njoey: (interrupts) wouldn\\'t you like to be a big brother to someone like me? please? \\n\\ngeorge: well, sure joey, sure, i would be thrilled. \\n\\nalec: that\\'s great george, thanks a lot i\\'ll get in touch with you. \\n\\njoey: wouldn\\'t you like to be a big brother.. \\n\\nalec: (grabs joey to stop him) ya alright joey that\\'s enough, let\\'s go (walking over to the counter) see ya. \\n\\njerry: what happened? \\n\\ngeorge: what could i do? did you see the mug on that kid? \\n\\njerry: (acting like joey) wouldn\\'t you like to pass the ketchup to someone like me? please? \\n\\njerry: hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on jeopardy now? \\n\\ngeorge: ya it used to be right in the middle of single jeopardy and now they do it right after single jeopardy. \\n\\njerry: ya, it\\'s much better isn\\'t it? \\n\\ngeorge: oh, n-no comparison. \\n\\njerry: hey, i gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one of those french-english dictionaries. \\n\\ngeorge: (stops jerry realizing something) hey hey hey hey hey hey. \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\ngeorge: your parents are going to paris right? \\n\\njerry: yea? \\n\\ngeorge: so i tell alec that i have to go to paris for an undetermined amount of time. then all i have to do is buy some post cards and have your parents mail them from paris. \\n\\njerry: what about little joey? \\n\\ngeorge: who? \\n\\njerry: ah, i think he\\'s probably better off. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m trying to get out of this big brother program. so when you get to paris (handing morty the postcards) all you have to do is drop \\'em in any mailbox. \\n\\nmorty: but there are no stamps on these. \\n\\ngeorge: well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps (pauses) i-i\\'ll reimburse you of course. \\n\\nhelen: why are you doing this? \\n\\njerry: he wants this guy to think he\\'s in paris. \\n\\nhelen: why? \\n\\njerry: because george is a deeply disturbed individual. \\n\\nkramer: oh hey, helen uh, could i uh, use some more of your hand lotion? \\n\\nhelen: i told you it was good.

(jerry smiling points to himself and nods with cards in his hands) so i took out my belt just to threaten him, and i got a glimpse of myself in the mirror. \\n\\nkramer: how serendipitous. \\n\\nmorty: so that night i cut off the loops and the executive was born. \\n\\nkramer: mmm \\n\\njerry: he also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized. (to morty) alright come on let\\'s play. \\n\\nkramer: did you call jack klompus yet? \\n\\nmorty: i haven\\'t been able to reach him. hey i\\'ll call him right now. \\n\\njerry: ah come on. \\n\\nmorty: just a second.

(chuckles) what kind of name is that for a clown, huh? \\n\\nrobin\\'s mother: excuse me...you must be george! i\\'m robin\\'s mother. oh, you seem like such a lovely young man! \\n\\ngeorge: well, i do what i can. (robin comes over.) \\n\\nrobin: hi mom, how\\'s everything? \\n\\nrobin\\'s mother: oh, this is just a wonderful party! \\n\\nrobin: the burgers should be ready in a minute. \\n\\ngeorge: ah, great, great. (sniffs) what\\'s that smell? smoke? (walks to the kitchen) hey everybody, i think i smell some smoke back here...(smoke boils into the doorway.) fire! fire! get out of the way! \\n\\ngeorge (to the emts): it was an inferno in there! an inferno! (eric, robin\\'s mother, and all the kids rush at george.) \\n\\neric: there he is! that\\'s him! (tries to clobber george with his big shoe.) \\n\\nrobin\\'s mother: that\\'s the coward that left us to die! \\n\\ngeorge (voice is hoarse from screaming): i...was trying to lead the way. we needed a leader! someone to lead the way to safety. \\n\\nrobin: but you yelled \"get out of my way\"! \\n\\ngeorge: because! because, as the leader...if i die...then all hope is lost! who would lead? the clown? instead of castigating me, you should all be thanking me. what kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where-where heroes are cast as villains? brave men as cowards? \\n\\nrobin: but i saw you push the women and children out of the way in a mad panic! i saw you knock them down! and when you ran out, you left everyone behind! \\n\\ngeorge: seemingly. seemingly, to the untrained eye, i can fully understand how you got that impression. what looked like pushing...what looked like knocking down...was a safety precaution! in a fire, you stay close to the ground, am i right? and when i ran out that door, i was not leaving anyone behind! oh, quite the contrary! i risked my life making sure that exit was clear. any other questions? \\n\\nfireman: how do you live with yourself? \\n\\ngeorge: its not easy. \\n\\ngeorge: so she doesn\\'t want to see me anymore. \\n\\njerry: did you knock her over too, or just the kids? \\n\\ngeorge: no, her too. and her mother. \\n\\njerry: really? her mother. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. i may have stepped on her arm, too, i don\\'t know. \\n\\njerry: you probably couldn\\'t see because of the smoke. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. but it was somebody\\'s arm. \\n\\njerry: hmm. so you feel \"women and children first,\" in this day and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion. \\n\\ngeorge: to some degree. \\n\\njerry: so basically, it\\'s every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves. \\n\\ngeorge: in a manner of speaking. \\n\\njerry: yeah, well, it\\'s honest. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. she should be commending me for treating everyone like equals. \\n\\njerry: well, perhaps when she\\'s released from the burn center, she\\'ll see things differently. \\n\\ngeorge: perhaps. \\n\\njerry: so, what was the fire? just a couple of greasy hamburgers? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. eric the clown put it out with his big shoe. \\n\\njerry: by the way, did you see this? (hands george a magazine) \\n\\ngeorge: what\\'s that? \\n\\njerry: it\\'s the leonard christian article about my show. plus my gig in miami got cancelled, i betcha it\\'s because of the article. \\n\\ngeorge: wow, he really does a number on you. (reads) \"seinfeld froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling.\" \\n\\njerry: i should have let her have it! i held back because of kramer. \\n\\ngeorge: you know what you oughta do. you should go to her office and heckle her. \\n\\njerry: yeah, right. \\n\\ngeorge: you know, like all the comedians always say, \\'how would you like it if i came to where you work and heckled you?\\' \\n\\njerry: yeah, that\\'d be something. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m not kidding, you should do it. \\n\\njerry: but wouldn\\'t that be the ultimate comedian\\'s revenge? i\\'ve always had a fantasy about doing that. \\n\\ngeorge: well, go ahead! do it! \\n\\njerry: why can\\'t i? \\n\\ngeorge: no reason! \\n\\njerry: you know what? i think i\\'m gonna do that! she came down to where i work, i\\'ll go down to where she works! \\n\\ngeorge: this is unprecedented! \\n\\njerry: there\\'s no precedent, baby! \\n\\ngeorge: what...are you using my babies now? \\n\\njerry: hey, nice shoes. what, you wear sandals to work? it\\'s always nice to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. that\\'s real conducive to the work atmosphere. i\\'m sure your co-workers really appreciate it. \\'hey, let\\'s go eat in toby\\'s office. great idea! we can check on her bunions!\\' \\n\\ntoby: you know, i have work to do here! i\\'m very busy! \\n\\njerry: oh, is this disruptive? you find it hard to work with someone...interrupting? \\n\\ntoby: well, how would you like it if i called security? \\n\\njerry: security? well, i don\\'t know how you\\'re gonna make it in this business if you can\\'t take it! ya gotta be tough! booo! boooo! \\n\\ntoby: no, (gets up out of her chair) that\\'s it. (kramer arrives; to kramer) get out of the way. \\n\\nkramer: hey, what\\'s going on? \\n\\njerry: boo! \\n\\nkramer: what\\'s happenin\\' here? \\n\\njerry: hiss! \\n\\nkramer: (going after toby) toby! toby! \\n\\ntoby: (voice; screaming) my pinky toe! \\n\\nkramer: (voice; yelling) toby! (shot of a shocked kramer is shown) oh, oh! \\n\\nkramer: what did you go up there to heckle her for? \\n\\njerry: because she came down to the club and heckled me! give her a taste of her own medicine! (george enters.) \\n\\nkramer: oh, yeah! you gave her a taste of medicine, alright. \\n\\njerry: well, i didn\\'t want her to have an accident. \\n\\ngeorge: what accident? \\n\\nkramer: well, after he heckled toby, she got so upset, she ran out of the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky toe. \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s unbelievable! \\n\\nkramer: yeah! then after the ambulance left, i found the toe! so i put it in a cracker jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital. \\n\\ngeorge: wha.. you ran? \\n\\nkramer: no, i jumped on the bus. i told the driver, \"i got a toe here, buddy - step on it.\" \\n\\ngeorge: holy cow! \\n\\nkramer: yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. well, i knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so i got out of the seat and i started walking towards him. he says, \"where do you think you\\'re going, cracker jack?\" i said, \"well, i got a little prize for ya, buddy - \" (kramer throws two quick punches and a massive uppercut) - knocked him out cold! \\n\\ngeorge: how could you do that?! \\n\\nkramer: then everybody is screamin,\\' because the driver, he\\'s passed out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! so, i grab him by the collar, i take him out of the seat, i get behind the wheel and now i\\'m drivin\\' the bus. \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'re batman. \\n\\nkramer: yeah. yeah, i am batman. then the mugger, he comes to, and he starts chokin\\' me! so i\\'m fightin\\' him off with one hand and i kept drivin\\' the bus with the other, y\\'know? then i managed to open up the door, and i kicked him out the door you know with my foot, you know - at the next stop. \\n\\njerry: you kept makin\\' all the stops? \\n\\nkramer: well, people kept ringin\\' the bell! \\n\\ngeorge: well, wha-what about the toe? what happened to the toe? \\n\\nkramer: well! i am happy to say that the little guy is back in place at the end of the line. \\n\\ngeorge: you did all this...for a pinky toe? \\n\\nkramer: well, it\\'s a valuable appendage. \\n\\njoanne: so, kramer found the toe, and they re-attached it. \\n\\nelaine: really. \\n\\njoanne: yea, poor kid. what an ordeal. \\n\\nmichael: and you know how extremely sensitive she is? \\n\\nelaine: i know. \\n\\nmichael: she\\'s gonna need our full support. \\n\\nelaine (wearily): yeah, right. \\n\\nother co-workers in hallway: look who\\'s here! toby! (toby enters on crutches.) \\n\\nmichael: toby, what can i do? can i get you something? \\n\\ntoby: oh no, no thank you. \\n\\nmichael: toby please let us help. we\\'re family. \\n\\ntoby: oh well, i could use some coffee. \\n\\njerry: she got the promotion? \\n\\nelaine (standing in the doorway): yep. \\n\\njerry: why? \\n\\nelaine: i\\'ll tell ya why. because of her pinky toe, that\\'s why. because lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn\\'t want to hurt her feelings. \\n\\njerry: too bad. \\n\\nelaine: sure, the pinky toe is cute! but, i mean, what is it? it\\'s useless! it does nothing. it\\'s got that little nail that is just impossible to cut. what do we need it for? \\n\\njerry: because elaine, that\\'s the one that goes \\'wee-wee-wee all the home.\\' \\n\\nelaine: why don\\'t you just shut the f- \\n\\nkramer (from his doorway): hey elaine, did you hear the good news? toby got promoted! \\n\\nelaine: yes, i heard, kramer - i work there, remember?? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, and you know what she told me? she said her first order of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon as possible. \\n\\nelaine: oh, wonderful! \\n\\nkramer: you know, throughout this whole thing, she always kept a smile on her face. \\n\\nelaine: oh, of course! she\\'s deranged. \\n\\njerry: i went down to the magazine, i pleaded with him to come and see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he\\'s going to write another article. \\n\\nronnie: i heard you went down to somebody\\'s office and heckled them? \\n\\njerry: damn right! we\\'ve been lapdogs long enough! \\n\\nronnie: how could you do that? i mean, everybody\\'s talking about it. \\n\\njerry: yeah well, it\\'s about time one of us drew a line in the sand. \\n\\nronnie: jerry, you\\'re like rosa parks. you opened the door for all of us. i can\\'t wait till the next time someone heckles me. \\n\\njerry: yeah, well, it won\\'t be long. \\n\\nannouncer: ladies and gentlemen, please welcome jerry seinfeld! \\n\\njerry: gotta go. (heads out on stage) \\n\\ngeorge: robin? robin! \\n\\nrobin: george, what is it? i\\'m working. \\n\\ngeorge: robin, listen to me. the most amazing thing has happened. kramer has opened my eyes. i think i\\'ve changed. \\n\\nrobin: what are you talking about? \\n\\ngeorge: o.k....(is about to explain. cut to jerry on-stage.) \\n\\njerry: i mean, bozo the clown...i mean does he really need \"the clown\" in his title, as clown? bozo, \"the\" clown? are we going to confuse him with bozo the district attorney? bozo the pope? there\\'s no other bozo... \\n\\ngeorge: ...you\\'ll see, things will be different now - if you just give me one more chance. \\n\\nrobin: l-listen, listen...i gotta think about this. (walks away.) \\n\\ngeorge: alright, but i\\'m serious about this. \\n\\nronnie (points his water gun at the bartender): alright, hand it over man! \\n\\njerry: ...that\\'s why men hunt and women nest. \\n\\ngeorge (from backstage): he\\'s got a gun! he\\'s got a gun! get out of the way! (tries to flee the bar in a mad panic. the audience in the club also goes nuts and heads for the exits. jerry stands onstage, perplexed.) \\n\\nrobin: george! this is ronnie kaye! \\n\\ngeorge: the prop comic? (ronnie holds up his water gun and smiles.) oh, hi...i didn\\'t recognize you, what...did you get a haircut? \\n\\nronnie (points to his nose): nostrils. \\n\\njerry: george - could i have a word? \\n\\nkramer: all right, get off at the next exit. \\n\\njerry: kramer, i\\'ve driven to east hampton many times, i know the exit. \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s a great house, pool, sun deck? yeah, i\\'ll be there. \\n\\njerry: (to elaine) you sure we\\'re makin\\' the right move? \\n\\nelaine: we gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we\\'ll get a weekend in the hamptons out of it. \\n\\njerry: didn\\'t they just have a baby? \\n\\nelaine: that was two years ago, remember? \\'jeh-ree, you gotta see the bay-bee! you gotta see the bay-bee!\\' \\n\\njerry: is it possible they\\'re just having babies to get people to visit them? \\n\\nkramer: hey jerry, you ever wear silk underwear? \\n\\njerry: no. \\n\\nkramer: put that on the top of your list. \\n\\njerry: no, not for me. a little too delightful. well, george and jane should be almost there by now. \\n\\nelaine: oh, isn\\'t that weird that george and jane haven\\'t had sex yet, but they\\'re spending a weekend together? \\n\\njerry: i know, george is pretty pleased about it. it\\'s like she signed a letter of intent. \\n\\nelaine: when\\'s rachel comin\\' out? \\n\\njerry: she\\'s makin\\' the three o\\'clock train. \\n\\nelaine: her father is so religious, i\\'m just amazed that he\\'s letting you see her again after that schindler\\'s list make-out session. \\n\\njerry: i bought him some kishka. \\n\\nkramer: what\\'s that? \\n\\njerry: it\\'s kind of a stuffed meat thing. israeli soldiers carry it. in case they\\'re captured behind enemy lines, they eat it and it kills them. \\n\\ngeorge: i never tasted a cough medicine i didn\\'t love. \\n\\njane: me too. i love cough medicine. \\n\\ngeorge: you see? we were made for each other. (thinking to himself) it\\'s amazing. if i reach out and touch her breast right not, she\\'d scream and throw me out of the car. but at this time tomorrow, i could touch it all i want. \\n\\njane: what\\'s your favorite? \\n\\ngeorge: potussan. ever try it with club soda? \\n\\njane: no. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, very refreshing. (thinking again) sex is like joining a private club. i\\'ll be the same me tomorrow, but suddenly, the no trespassing sign will be gone. \\n\\njane: are we almost there? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, about ten, fifteen minutes. but i have to stop at a vegetable stand. \\n\\njane: what for? \\n\\ngeorge: my mother loves hampton tomatoes. she\\'s nuts for hampton tomatoes. \\n\\njane: can you buy \\'em later? i really wanna get some... sun. \\n\\nkramer: hey jerry. rub some lotion on my back. \\n\\njerry: who are you, mrs. robinson? \\n\\nkramer: come on, i\\'ll rub some on yours. \\n\\njerry: no, that\\'s no sweet\\'ning the deal. no. \\n\\ngeorge: (to jane) you know, when i was a kid, i once found a dollar and fifty cents in change on the bottom of the pool. \\n\\njane: (no feeling in her voice) you must\\'ve been excited. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. hey, you know, i gotta go get these tomatoes. you wanna go for a ride? \\n\\njane: i don\\'t think so. \\n\\ngeorge: \\'kay. i\\'ll uh, i\\'ll see you later. anybody want some tomatoes? \\n\\njerry: no thanks. \\n\\nkramer: no. (george leaves for the tomatoes) \\n\\njane: i\\'m gonna take a dip. (she leaves for beach, elaine enters with a shady hat on) \\n\\njerry: and then there\\'s maude. (she sits down next to jerry) \\n\\nelaine: look at my face, look at it. you see any lines? \\n\\njerry: no lines. \\n\\nelaine: you know why? one word shade. \\n\\njerry: so when are we gonna see this baby? when is the momentous event? \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t know. they\\'re takin\\' a nap or something. \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach. elaine, you wanna come? \\n\\nelaine: (sarcastic) no thanks. i got plenty of girlfriends. \\n\\njerry: (looking toward beach) oh this is interesting. \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\njerry: jane\\'s topless. (they all look) \\n\\nkramer: yo yo ma. \\n\\njerry: boutros boutros-ghali. \\n\\nelaine: nice rack. (carol and michael inside open back door) \\n\\ncarol: come on, you guys. you can come and see the bay-bee! \\n\\njerry: oh, in a minute, carol. \\n\\nkramer: we\\'re gonna be right there. \\n\\njerry: this is weird wild stuff. george hasn\\'t even seen her yet. \\n\\nelaine: why do you think we\\'re getting the sneak preview? \\n\\nkramer: maybe she\\'s trying to create a buzz. \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\nkramer: you know, get some good word of mouth goin\\'. \\n\\njerry: oh, here she comes. (they pretend to not have watched as jane enters) \\n\\njane: i\\'m thirsty. anyone want a drink? \\n\\njerry: no thanks. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m good. \\n\\nkramer: deh-deh-deh-deh- (jane exits) all right, show\\'s over. i\\'m goin\\' to the beach. \\n\\ncarol: adam (the baby\\'s name), jerry and elaine are here. \\n\\nelaine: oh, he\\'s a cute little shnugly baby. \\n\\ncarol: isn\\'t he gorgeous? (elaine looks at baby, only to be frightened and turn away) \\n\\nelaine: ugghh. \\n\\ncarol: is she gorgeous? (elaine and jerry looking away) \\n\\nelaine: oh, gorgeous, yes. \\n\\njerry: so very gorgeous. \\n\\ncarol: michael, shut the door! you\\'re letting bugs in. \\n\\njerry: is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen? \\n\\nelaine: uh, i couldn\\'t look. it was like the pekinese. \\n\\njerry: boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. (they sit) and, you know, the thing is, they\\'re never gonna know, no one\\'s ever gonna tell them. \\n\\nelaine: oh, you have to lie. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s a must lie situation. \\n\\nelaine: yes, it\\'s a must lie situation. \\n\\njerry: you know, i don\\'t think we should tell george we saw jane topless. \\n\\nelaine: no, i don\\'t think so. \\n\\njerry: in fact remind me to tell kramer too. \\n\\nkramer: oooh, lobsters. \\n\\nben: oh this ointment should do it. \\n\\ncarol: how are you feeling, adam? (she sees elaine in the hall) elaine! (elaine enters) this is our pediatrician, ben feffa. \\n\\nelaine: hi. \\n\\ncarol: look at him, elaine. how gorgeous is he? i ask you, how gorgeous? \\n\\nelaine: (looking at ben) pretty gorgeous. \\n\\nben: elaine, you have children? \\n\\nelaine: me? oh no, but i\\'d love to have a baby, i mean, i can\\'t wait to have a baby. i\\'m just dyin\\' to have a baby. \\n\\nben: a beautiful woman like you should. you\\'re quite breathtaking. \\n\\nelaine: breathtaking? i\\'m breathtaking? \\n\\ncarol: and he\\'s very particular. ben, you\\'re staying tonight, right? \\n\\nben: uh, sure. (elaine celebrates to herself as jerry enters and quickly looks away from the baby) \\n\\njerry: ah, i\\'m gonna go pick up rachel at the station. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, see ya. \\n\\njerry: okay. (he leaves) \\n\\ncarol: oh, just look at him! \\n\\nben: yeah, he really is breathtaking. (elaine confused by his comment) \\n\\nrachel: train was so crowded. i had to sit in the seat facing the wrong way. \\n\\njerry: oh i like that. it\\'s like going back in time. (george comes outside) \\n\\ngeorge: hey rachel! \\n\\nrachel: (quickly gets out of seat) hi. i\\'m gonna go in there to change. \\n\\ngeorge: what kind of a greeting was that? \\n\\njerry: she\\'s got greeting problems. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. i love hampton tomatoes. you know, you can eat \\'em like apples. you know it\\'s funny, the tomato never really took on as a hand fruit. \\n\\njerry: well, the tomato\\'s an anomaly. so successful with the ketchup and the sauce, but you can\\'t find a good one. (kramer enters with a box of lobster) \\n\\nkramer: hey, hey, hey! look at what i got! \\n\\ngeorge: hey! wow, the k-man! (they walk into the kitchen inside) \\n\\njerry: you got lobster for everybody? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, and they\\'re fresh! right out of the ocean. \\n\\ngeorge: this is fantastic. man, what a weekend. swimming, lobster for dinner... \\n\\nkramer: i know, it\\'s great. and i saw jane topless. (jerry shows that \\'damn\\' expression behind george) \\n\\ngeorge: you saw who, what? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, i saw jane topless. well, we all saw her. \\n\\njerry: (jerry realizes the situation is hopeless) all right. \\n\\ngeorge: you saw jane topless? \\n\\njerry: well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless. \\n\\ngeorge: oh you mean face down on her chest. \\n\\njerry: no. \\n\\ngeorge: face up on her back? \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: well why\\'d she do that? \\n\\nkramer: i guess she was hot. \\n\\ngeorge: you mean she just laid there topless? \\n\\nkramer: no, no, she got up, she walked around... \\n\\ngeorge: walked around? and you looked? \\n\\nkramer: of course. she\\'s got a great body, buddy. all right, i\\'m gonna go upstairs, i\\'ll be right back. \\n\\ngeorge: i can\\'t believe that you saw her before me. \\n\\njerry: think of me as a doctor. (they go outside again) \\n\\ngeorge: well, how good a look did you get? \\n\\njerry: well what\\'d you mean? \\n\\ngeorge: well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police sketch artist... \\n\\njerry: they\\'d pick her up in about ten minutes. \\n\\ngeorge: great, great. so anytime you want you can just visualize her naked. \\n\\njerry: (looking of into the distance) i guess that\\'s true... \\n\\ngeorge: stop it, stop it! it\\'s not fair. it\\'s not fair. i don\\'t like this situation, jerry. i don\\'t like it one bit. \\n\\njerry: what do you want me to do? you wanna see rachel naked? \\n\\ngeorge: yes, yes! the punishment should fit the crime. \\n\\njerry: you can see me naked. i can offer you that. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s like i\\'m neil armstrong. i turn around for a sip of tang and you jump out first. \\n\\nelaine: nobody ever called me breathtaking before. \\n\\njerry: i\\'ve never been called breathtaking either. \\n\\nelaine: i mean, if he thinks that that baby\\'s breathtaking, then who\\'s not breathtaking? \\n\\njerry: maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, right, that\\'s a possibility. i have to find out. \\n\\njerry: how are you gonna do that? \\n\\nelaine: i can be very clever. \\n\\nrachel: i\\'m gonna take a swim. \\n\\nelaine: oh, me too. i\\'ll meet you down. (she goes in the hall and sees george) oh, don\\'t go in, rachel\\'s getting undressed. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, okay. (starts to walk other way and then walks to their room and goes in) \\n\\nrachel: hey! \\n\\ngeorge: oh, sorry. \\n\\nrachel: don\\'t you knock? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m sorry, uh, it\\'s not like i\\'m gonna see something i\\'ve never seen before. \\n\\njerry: you might have. \\n\\ngeorge: i didn\\'t. \\n\\njerry: you won\\'t. \\n\\nrachel: what\\'d you want anyway, george? \\n\\njerry: yes, george. i\\'m kind of wondering myself. what is it what you want? \\n\\ngeorge: no, i was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum. \\n\\njerry: oh! so you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some gum. \\n\\ngeorge: yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms me up. \\n\\nrachel: we don\\'t have any gum. \\n\\ngeorge: okay. (chewing) thanks anyway. (continues to chew as he exits) \\n\\nrachel: strange man. \\n\\njerry: wait\\'ll you get to know him. \\n\\nrachel: so where is this baby, anyway? \\n\\njerry: oh, check it out. i guarantee you\\'ve never seen anything quite so objectionable. it\\'s down the hall, third door on your left. (rachel walks down hall, walks in on george changing out of his swimsuit) \\n\\nrachel: (she screams) oh my god! i\\'m sorry, i thought this was the baby\\'s room. i\\'m really sorry. (she exits) \\n\\ngeorge: (realizing he was short changed) i was in the pool! i was in the pool! \\n\\ngeorge: did she do it on purpose? \\n\\njerry: it was my fault, i told her the wrong door. \\n\\ngeorge: i was supposed to see her. she wasn\\'t supposed to see me. \\n\\njerry: so what? \\n\\ngeorge: well ordinarily i wouldn\\'t mind. but... \\n\\njerry: but... \\n\\ngeorge: well i just got back from swimming in the pool. and the water was cold... \\n\\njerry: oh... you mean... shrinkage. \\n\\ngeorge: yes. significant shrinkage. \\n\\njerry: so you feel you were short changed. \\n\\ngeorge: yes! i mean, if she thinks that\\'s me she\\'s under a complete misapprehension. that was not me, jerry. that was not me. \\n\\njerry: well, so what\\'s the difference? \\n\\ngeorge: what if she discusses it with jane? \\n\\njerry: oh, she\\'s not gonna tell jane. \\n\\ngeorge: how do you know? \\n\\njerry: women aren\\'t like us. \\n\\ngeorge: they\\'re worse! they\\'re much worse than us, they talk about everything! couldn\\'t you at least tell her about the shrinkage factor? \\n\\njerry: no, i\\'m not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. besides, i think women know about shrinkage. \\n\\ngeorge: how do women know about shrinkage? \\n\\njerry: isn\\'t it common knowledge? \\n\\ngeorge & jerry: (elaine walking down the hall they notice her and wave her into the room) elaine! get! (she enters) \\n\\ngeorge: do women know about shrinkage? \\n\\nelaine: what do you mean, like laundry? \\n\\ngeorge: no. \\n\\njerry: like when a man goes swimming... afterwards... \\n\\nelaine: it shrinks? \\n\\njerry: like a frightened turtle! \\n\\nelaine: why does it shrink? \\n\\ngeorge: it just does. \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t know how you guys walk around with those things. \\n\\nmichael: thanks for the lobster, kramer. \\n\\nkramer: rachel, aren\\'t you gonna have any? \\n\\nrachel: oh, no, i can\\'t. i\\'m kosher, we don\\'t eat shellfish. \\n\\nkramer: you mean you\\'ve never tasted lobster? \\n\\nrachel: no. \\n\\nkramer: wow. you\\'re so pious. i really respect that. you know when you die, you\\'re gonna get some special attention. \\n\\ncarol: oh, the baby\\'s crying. i\\'ll go get him. he can sit with us. \\n\\nelaine & jerry: no! \\n\\njerry: no, you don\\'t wanna do that. you\\'ll be uncomfortable. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, finish eating. the baby\\'s not gonna have any fun over here. we\\'re-we\\'re not fun for a baby. \\n\\njerry: yeah, the lobster\\'ll scare him. \\n\\ncarol: i\\'m gonna get him. \\n\\ngeorge: see, look at this. (wearing a very tight shirt) rachel, my t-shirt shrunk. it used to be much bigger, and now it shrunk. you see, that\\'s what water does. it shrinks things. \\n\\nelaine: really? tell us more, mr. science. (rachel whispers in jane\\'s ear, which prompts jane to laugh) \\n\\ngeorge: what\\'re you doing? what\\'re you, telling secrets? what\\'re you laughing at? \\n\\njane: it\\'s nothing, george. \\n\\ngeorge: you know, it\\'s very impolite to tell secrets. are you talking about me? \\n\\njane: what is it with you? \\n\\njerry: (to george) easy big fella. \\n\\nmichael: so kramer, where\\'d you get all these lobster, at the fleesher\\'s market? \\n\\nkramer: no, i got \\'em in the ocean. \\n\\nmichael: the ocean? what\\'d you mean? \\n\\nkramer: well, i found this rope and i kept tugging on it, and all these lobsters came up. \\n\\nmichael: those are commercial lobster traps. you can\\'t take those lobsters from there. that\\'s against the law. \\n\\nkramer: take it easy. there\\'s plenty of lobsters in the ocean for everyone. \\n\\nmichael: my father was a lobsterman. he got up every morning at four and came home every night stinking of brine! he sent me through law school with the lobsters he caught! (kramer stands up from table) \\n\\ncarol: (entering with baby) here he is. \\n\\nkramer: ahhh! (shocked after seeing the baby) \\n\\nelaine: some night, huh? \\n\\nben: yeah, i wish i had my telescope. \\n\\nelaine: some dinner, huh? \\n\\nben: nothing like fresh caught lobster. \\n\\nelaine: some house, huh? \\n\\nben: it was built by mark fargman. he build a lot of these homes here. \\n\\nelaine: some ugly baby, huh? \\n\\nben: what did you say? \\n\\nelaine: (improvising) i said, uh, some snuggly baby. \\n\\nben: he is something. \\n\\nelaine: well, to tell you the truth, dr. feffa, i , i was surprised to hear you use a word like breathtaking to describe a baby, i mean, because you also used it referring to me. \\n\\nben: well, you know elaine, sometimes you say things just to be nice. (elaine relieved, then confused, not knowing if he was being nice to her or to the baby) \\n\\njerry: you told her? \\n\\nrachel: yeah, what\\'s the big deal? \\n\\njerry: you don\\'t understand. this organ, it\\'s very... schizophrenic. \\n\\nrachel: jerry, what the difference? you know, you\\'re the ones obsessed with this stuff, not us. i\\'m sure it wouldn\\'t matter to jane. \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'re going back to new york now? \\n\\njane: yeah, i have some things to do. \\n\\ngeorge: uh huh. uh huh! i think you spoke to your little friend rachel, that\\'s what i think. \\n\\njane: so what if i did? \\n\\ngeorge: and she didn\\'t say something to you about a certain something? \\n\\njane: i don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about. \\n\\ngeorge: *i* think that *you* think that a certain *something* is not all that it could be, when in fact it is is all that it *should* be, and *more*! \\n\\njane: (patronizing george) i\\'m sure it is. \\n\\ngeorge: look, you don\\'t understand. there was shrinkage. \\n\\nkramer: you looking for this? (holding up lobster) \\n\\nrachel: oh, kramer! you startled me. \\n\\nkramer: well, i thought you might wind up around here. \\n\\nrachel: yeah, well, i couldn\\'t stop thinking about how everyone was enjoying the lobster so much an\\' well i thought i little taste wouldn\\'t hurt, huh? \\n\\nkramer: no i\\'m afraid i couldn\\'t do that. \\n\\nrachel: why not? \\n\\nkramer: well, that wouldn\\'t be kosher. \\n\\nrachel: c\\'mon, kramer. i really want to try it. \\n\\nkramer: nah, i\\'m sorry, honey. not on my watch. \\n\\nrachel: come on, kramer. \\n\\nkramer: heyahhh! \\n\\nrachel: i just heard a car drive out. what was that? \\n\\njerry: oh, that\\'s just jane driving home to new york in the middle of the night. (rachel shocked) \\n\\ncarol: george, thanks so much for making breakfast. \\n\\nelaine: george, these are the best scrambled eggs i\\'ve ever tasted. \\n\\nkramer: ya i didn\\'t know you could cook. \\n\\ngeorge: well, i\\'m just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host. \\n\\nben: yes, george, the whole breakfast is breathtaking.

(holds up lobster bib) \\n\\nrachel: there\\'s lobster in these eggs? \\n\\ngeorge: not that much. you know, they tend to shrink in the water. \\n\\njerry: well, i guess i gotta go, too. \\n\\nelaine: well, this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend. (policeman knocks on door, michael answers) \\n\\nmichael: excuse me? \\n\\npolice: i\\'m sorry to bother you, but we\\'re trying to track down a lobster poacher that uh cleaned out on of the traps. \\n\\nkramer: wonder what\\'s goin\\' on. \\n\\ngeorge: ah, i guess i should go up and apologize. \\n\\nmichael: there he is, officer. (michael points to kramer, kramer waves to policeman) \\n\\nrachel: ahh! don\\'t you ever knock? \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t know why rachel had to drive back with michael and carol. \\n\\nelaine: hey, if you saw me naked, i wouldn\\'t want to ride back in the same car with you either. \\n\\njerry: i still can\\'t believe michael finked on kramer. \\n\\nelaine: how is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine? \\n\\njerry: they got some sort of program. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, there\\'s a tomato stand, let\\'s stop, i can get some more. \\n\\njerry: hey, isn\\'t that michael\\'s car? \\n\\nelaine: there\\'s rachel. \\n\\ngeorge: where?

(they drink) mmm, oh, thank you, mr lippman, i can\\'t tell you how much i appreciate this. i mean, of course i deserve it. \\n\\nmr. lippman: well, you\\'re really on your way now. \\n\\nelaine: you really oughtta do something about that cold. \\n\\njerry: you got a raise? \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t fool around, (banging on the table) baby! \\n\\njerry: i thought you said pendant was in financial trouble. \\n\\nelaine: they were, but they\\'re being absorbed by matsushimi, that big japanese conglomerate. \\n\\njerry: oh, when did that happen? \\n\\nelaine: they\\'re signing the papers next week. \\n\\njerry: does this mean they\\'re gonna be publishing kramer\\'s coffee table book? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, they\\'ll definitely do it now. \\n\\njerry: boy, you\\'re on quite a streak. job promotion, plus you\\'re back with jake jarmal. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, it\\'s gettin\\' serious, we\\'re talking about moving in together. \\n\\njerry: boy, you really got it all, i\\'m sure helen \"girlie\" brown would be very proud of you. \\n\\njerry: speaking of having it all ... where were you? \\n\\ngeorge: i went to the beach. (jerry and elaine exchange looks) \\n\\njerry: oh, the beach. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s not working, jerry. it\\'s just not working. (sits down next to elaine) \\n\\njerry: what is it that isn\\'t working? \\n\\ngeorge: why did it all turn out like this for me? i had so much promise. i was personable, i was bright. (elaine turns showing disagreement) oh, maybe not academically speaking, (elaine nods correct) i was perceptive. i always know when someone\\'s uncomfortable at a party. \\n\\njerry: (pointing to napkins; to elaine) could i get napkin over there? \\n\\ngeorge: it became very clear to me sitting out there today, that every decision i\\'ve ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. my life is the complete opposite of everything i want it to be. every instinct i have, in every of aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat ... it\\'s all been wrong. (chuckles) everywhere. \\n\\nwaitress : tuna on toast, coleslaw, cup of coffee. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. no, no, no, wait a minute, i always have tuna on toast. nothing\\'s ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. i want the complete opposite of on toast. chicken salad, on rye, un-toasted with a side of potato salad ... and a cup of tea. (laughs) \\n\\nelaine: well, there\\'s no telling what can happen from this. \\n\\njerry: you know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, \\'cuz salmon swim against the current, (hand motion of the salmon swimming against the current) and the tuna swim with it. (hand motion of the tuna swimming with it) \\n\\ngeorge: (annoyed) good for the tuna. \\n\\nelaine: ah, george, you know, that woman just looked at you. \\n\\ngeorge: so what? what am i supposed to do? \\n\\nelaine: go talk to her. \\n\\ngeorge: elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live with their parents, don\\'t approach strange women. \\n\\njerry: well here\\'s your chance to try the opposite. instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, i should do the opposite, i should. \\n\\njerry: if every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right. \\n\\ngeorge: yes, i will do the opposite. i used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now i will do the opposite, and i will do something! \\n\\ngeorge: excuse me, uh i couldn\\'t help but notice that you were looking in my direction. \\n\\nvictoria: oh, yes i was, you just ordered the same exact lunch as me. \\n\\ngeorge: my name is george. i\\'m unemployed and i live with my parents. \\n\\nvictoria: i\\'m victoria. hi. \\n\\njerry: (on the phone) are you kidding? they can\\'t cancel that show on me now, it\\'s too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. alright, alright ... okay, bye. (hangs up the phone) \\n\\nkramer: hey. buddy, it\\'s all happening! \\n\\njerry: what\\'s happening? \\n\\nkramer: the coffee table book. it\\'s a go-oo! \\n\\njerry: oh yeah, i heard all about it. \\n\\nkramer: you know what this means? i\\'m starting the book tour. first stop  regis and kathy lee. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re going on regis and kathy lee? \\n\\nkramer: oh, you better believe it! \\n\\njerry: i\\'ll loan you my puffy shirt. \\n\\nkramer: no, no, no. \\n\\njerry: what\\'re you gonna talk about? \\n\\nkramer: well, coffee tables. \\n\\njerry: hello? what? yeah, sure, i\\'ll do it. i just had something cancelled the same weekend. ok. great. bye. (hangs up the phone; turns to kramer) you know, life is amazing. i just lost a job and five minutes later get another, same weekend, same money. \\n\\nkramer: you know who you are? even steven \\n\\nvictoria: are you growing a beard? \\n\\ngeorge: why shave every day? it just grows right back. \\n\\nvictoria: i guess ... \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m afraid i\\'m just not interested in how i present myself. if those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably isn\\'t gonna work. \\n\\nvictoria: hey watch, he just cut you off! did you see that?! \\n\\ngeorge: take it easy. take it easy. it\\'s not the end of the world. \\n\\nman #1 : hey baby, how about a little tongue action, huh? \\n\\nman #2 : yeah, stick your tongue down his throat! \\n\\nvictoria: what are we gonna do? should we just move? \\n\\ngeorge: that won\\'t be necessary. \\n\\ngeorge: shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! we\\'re trying to watch the movie! and if i have to tell you again, we\\'re gonna take it outside and i\\'m gonna show you what it\\'s like! you understand me? now, shut your mouths or i\\'ll shut \\'em for ya, and if you think i\\'m kidding, just try me. try me. because i would love it! \\n\\nvictoria: are you sure you don\\'t wanna come up, i mean, it\\'s only nine thirty. \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t think we should. we really don\\'t know each other very well. \\n\\nvictoria: who are you, george costanza? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m the opposite of every guy you\\'ve ever met. \\n\\ntheater manager: excuse me, is your name elaine? \\n\\nelaine: yes. \\n\\ntheater manager: were you suposed to meet a jake jarmal here? \\n\\nelaine: yeah. \\n\\ntheater manager: well, i\\'m afraid he\\'s been in an accident. \\n\\nelaine: (gasp) an accident? what happened? \\n\\ntheater manager: well-he got side-swiped by a cab, but he\\'s alright. he\\'s in st.vincent hospital, room 907. \\n\\nelaine: oh. ok. thank you. \\n\\nelaine: could i have a box of jujyfruits? \\n\\ncounterperson: (handing the jujyfruits to elaine) there you go. \\n\\njake: so, then, you know, the light was clearly green, i started walking, he skidded and he went right into my hip. \\n\\nelaine: (with her mouth full of jujyfruit) oh, that is so terrible. that is so terrible, jake. i mean, how can people be so stupid? just sickening. \\n\\nelaine: you want one? \\n\\njake: no thanks. \\n\\nelaine: so when do you think you\\'re gonna get outta here? \\n\\njake: where did you get those? \\n\\nelaine: at the movies. \\n\\njake: didn\\'t the theater manager give you the message before you went in? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, he did. \\n\\njake: then when did you get those? \\n\\nelaine: right after ... that ... \\n\\njake: so you heard that i was in a car accident, and then decided to stop off for some jujyfruit? \\n\\nelaine: well... the counter...was right there, and... \\n\\njake: i would think, under the circumstances, it would have sent you running out the building. apparently, it didn\\'t have any effect on you. \\n\\nelaine: no, no, it does! \\n\\njake: (angry) if you got into a car accident, i can guarantee you i wouldn\\'t stop for jujyfruit! \\n\\nelaine: but...jake... \\n\\njake: i would like to be alone now, please. \\n\\nelaine: but, jake, i didn\\'t... \\n\\njake: goodnight! \\n\\npoker player #1: ah, whaddya say we call it a night? \\n\\npoker player #2: good idea, i\\'m kinda tired. \\n\\npoker player #3: how\\'d you do? \\n\\npoker player #4: won 50. \\n\\npoker player #2: lost 72. \\n\\npoker player #1: won 37. \\n\\npoker player #3: lost 15. \\n\\njerry: (shocked) broke even. \\n\\nregis: can i bring out our next guest now? \\n\\nkathy lee: please, please. \\n\\nregis: young guy, he\\'s got a new book coming out, and it\\'s about, and this is the best part - \\n\\nkathy lee: i love this. \\n\\nregis: it\\'s a coffee table book about coffee tables!

(reaches in her bag for money.) \\n\\njerry: that\\'s alright, i got it. \\n\\nelaine: jerry! \\n\\njerry: elaine, stop it. \\n\\nelaine: hey, just because i\\'m not working doesn\\'t mean i haven\\'t got any money. (to vendor) yo! dogs! two! \\n\\njerry: i\\'m sorry. \\n\\nannouncer on p.a. system: your attention please...the new york yankees would like to welcome miss connecticut, miss rhode island and miss north dakota, all of whom will be competing in the miss america pageant this weekend in atlantic city. (the three contestants make their way to their seats, right across the aisle from jerry and elaine.) \\n\\njerry (to elaine): now, there\\'s a career path you may have overlooked. \\n\\nelaine: ooh, i gotta check my machine. i\\'m waiting to hear about an interview. doubleday is looking for somebody to replace jackie onassis. \\n\\njerry: oh, she worked at doubleday...? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, she was an editor. \\n\\njerry: right, just like you. \\n\\nelaine: yeah. can you hold my seat? (elaine gets up.) \\n\\ncrowd: hey! down in front! (elaine clambers over jerry and exits.) \\n\\njerry (offers a hot dog to miss rhode island): hot dog? \\n\\nmiss rhode island: no, thanks. i\\'m watching my weight. \\n\\njerry: ah. i\\'m watching my height. my doctor doesn\\'t want me to get any taller. so you\\'re miss, uh... \\n\\nmiss rhode island: rhode island. \\n\\njerry: i was almost mr. coffee. they felt i was a little too relaxed. (miss rhode island laughs.) \\n\\ngeorge: miss rhode island? when are you seeing her? \\n\\njerry: tonight. i have to call her, she\\'s staying in a hotel. \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'re incredible. \\n\\njerry: and get this - i\\'m working in atlantic city this weekend, and she\\'s going to be down there for the pageant. \\n\\ngeorge: what if she becomes miss america? you could be dating miss america, jerry! \\n\\njerry: the only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone. \\n\\ngeorge: chaperone? what, are you kidding? \\n\\njerry: no, it\\'s part of the contest rules. \\n\\ngeorge: what does the chaperone do? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know, she just sits there. \\n\\ngeorge: can she talk? \\n\\njerry: i\\'m not sure if she\\'s allowed to talk. (picks up the phone and dials.) \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'re calling her? \\n\\njerry: yeah. (sings) there she is...miss - yes, room 417 please? karen hanson? \\n\\ngeorge: hey, did you know that the yankees don\\'t wear cotton jerseys? \\n\\njerry: of course, they\\'re polyester. \\n\\ngeorge: well, what is that? that\\'s a crime! do you know how hot those things get? they should be wearing cotton. \\n\\njerry: why do they wear polyester? \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t know. that\\'s all gonna change. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re going to do something about it? \\n\\ngeorge: why shouldn\\'t i? \\n\\njerry (doubtfully): no reason... \\n\\nlandis: of course, jackie o. was a great lady. those are going to be some tough shoes to fill. everyone loved her. she had such...grace. \\n\\nelaine (gushing): yes! grace! \\n\\nlandis: not many people have grace. \\n\\nelaine: well, you know, grace is a tough one. i like to think i have a little grace...not as much as jackie - \\n\\nlandis: you can\\'t have \"a little grace.\" you either have grace, or you...don\\'t. \\n\\nelaine: o.k., fine, i have...no grace. \\n\\nlandis: and you can\\'t acquire grace. \\n\\nelaine: well, i have no intention of \"getting\" grace. \\n\\nlandis: grace isn\\'t something you can pick up at the market. \\n\\nelaine (fed up): alright, alright, look - i don\\'t have grace, i don\\'t want grace...i don\\'t even say grace, o.k.? \\n\\nlandis: thank you for coming in. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, yeah, right. \\n\\nlandis: we\\'ll make our choice in a few days, and we\\'ll let you know. \\n\\nelaine (stands up): i have no chance, do i? \\n\\nlandis: no. (they shake hands.) \\n\\nlandis\\'s intercom: justin pitt to see you. \\n\\nelaine: justin pitt? \\n\\nlandis: he was a very close friend of mrs. onassis\\'s. \\n\\nelaine: \"mrs. onassis\\'s\"? that\\'s hard to pronounce. \\n\\nlandis: excuse me? \\n\\nelaine: nothing. (mr. pitt comes in with some papers in hand.) \\n\\npitt: mrs. landis, there\\'s something wrong with this copying machine, it\\'s all coming out slanted. now, i don\\'t know if this is your department or not. \\n\\nlandis: justin pitt, this is elaine benes. (elaine turns around. with sunglasses and a scarf on her head, she bears a close resemblance to jackie o.) \\n\\npitt (clearly affected by elaine\\'s appearance): charmed. \\n\\nelaine: i was a great admirer of mrs. onass-sis-sis-sis... \\n\\njerry: hello, karen? it\\'s jerry seinfeld. oh, that\\'s very sweet of you. you know, you better be careful, you don\\'t want to get too congenial. they\\'ll slap that \"miss congeniality\" on you, and you\\'ll congene yourself right out of the contest. so, what time do you want to get together later? what? so what, we don\\'t need the chaperone. (to george) the chaperone can\\'t make it. (to karen) oh, you\\'re not gonna get disqualified! so, we\\'re not going? (kramer enters.) hold on one second. (to kramer) hey, what are you doing tonight? \\n\\nkramer: nothin.\\' \\n\\njerry: i\\'m going out with one of the miss america contestants, you wanna go? \\n\\nkramer: what state? \\n\\njerry: rhode island. \\n\\nkramer: they\\'re never in contention. \\n\\ngeorge: how do you know? \\n\\nkramer: because i\\'ve seen every miss america pageant since i was six. \\n\\njerry: look, do you want to go or not? i\\'ll buy you dinner. \\n\\nkramer: giddy-up! \\n\\njerry (to karen): i think i got someone! \\n\\npitt (looking at elaine and smiling): the resemblance is uncanny. (elaine, sipping soda through a straw, looks up with a sour expression on her face.) even the brown eyes. \\n\\nelaine: well, a lot of people have brown eyes. \\n\\npitt: no, there\\'s something else. an indefinable quality. \\n\\nelaine: grace? \\n\\npitt: grace, yes. \\n\\nelaine: you think ihave grace? \\n\\npitt: some grace, yes. \\n\\nelaine: just some? \\n\\npitt: well, you don\\'t want too much grace or you won\\'t be able to stand. \\n\\nelaine (laughing): oh, mr. pitt. \\n\\npitt: elaine, i want you to come and work for me as my personal assistant. now, i\\'ll pay you the same as pendant, but i would need you to start right away. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, buck. talk to you for a second? \\n\\nshowalter: sure, george. \\n\\ngeorge: how\\'s everything going? everything o.k.? \\n\\nshowalter: well, all of a sudden there\\'s a problem with tartabull\\'s swing... \\n\\ngeorge: listen, buck, i uh...obviously i don\\'t need to talk to you about the importance of player morale, but uh...i\\'ve been talking to some of the guys, and some of them - i don\\'t want to mention any names - but some of them...they\\'re not too happy with the polyester uniforms. \\n\\nshowalter: how so? \\n\\ngeorge: well, they get very hot in the polyester. you know, it\\'s not a natural fibre. i think they would prefer cotton. \\n\\nshowalter: cotton, huh? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. cotton breathes, you see, it\\'s much softer. imagine playing games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. don\\'t you think that would be an advantage? they\\'re cooler, they\\'re more comfortable...they\\'re happier - they\\'re gonna play better. \\n\\nshowalter: you may have something there, george. \\n\\ngeorge: oh - i\\'ve got something. \\n\\nshowalter (considering): hmm. cotton uniforms. \\n\\njerry: congratulations! \\n\\nelaine: yeah! and the best part is, i still get to look for work in publishing. \\n\\njerry: now, what is it that you do, exactly? \\n\\nelaine: i attend to his personal affairs. \\n\\njerry: like what? \\n\\nelaine: well, like tomorrow for example, i have to uh...i have to buy him some socks. \\n\\njerry: really! socks! \\n\\nelaine: yeah. white ones. like the ones you wear with sneakers. \\n\\njerry: hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear! (kramer enters.) \\n\\nkramer (shows jerry his outfit): so, what do you think? does this work? \\n\\njerry: listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got something else to do and just \"recede into the night,\" if you know what i mean. \\n\\nkramer: no way! \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nkramer: look, if you think i\\'m just going to step aside and do nothing while you defile this woman, you\\'re crazy. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m not going to \"defile\" her! \\n\\nkramer: that\\'s right, because i\\'m going to see it doesn\\'t happen. look, jerry, these girls are miss america contestants. it\\'s every little girl\\'s dream. and i\\'m not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery of everything the pageant stands for. \\n\\njerry: but - \\n\\nkramer (holds up his hand): aaah! no buts! those are my rules. \\n\\njerry: but wait a minute... \\n\\nkramer: now, if you want to go out and have some good, wholesome fun with a nice girl, i\\'d be glad to help you out...if you\\'re looking for something more than that, you\\'ve got the wrong guy, buddy! (jerry tries to get a word in during this entire speech, but kramer won\\'t budge an inch.) \\n\\nkramer: if you were miss america, what would you do to make the world a better place? \\n\\nkaren: as miss america, i would try and bring an end to world hunger. if every person sacrificed one meal a week, there would be enough to feed the whole world! \\n\\njerry: that\\'s a hell of a plan. (to kramer) listen - \\n\\nkramer (to karen): what advice would you give young people? \\n\\njerry: alright, kramer! \\n\\nkramer: this is important stuff! she\\'s got to be able to answer these questions. she\\'s not going to have time to think, out there, with millions of people watching her. any hesitation could cost her the crown. you know, poise counts. \\n\\nkaren: you really know a lot about this, don\\'t you? \\n\\nkramer: oh yeah, like last year? miss texas? now, she should have won easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition. \\n\\nkaren: well, what could she have done? \\n\\nkramer: tape her breasts together. (jerry is shocked.) \\n\\nkaren: what else? \\n\\nkramer: well, take you for example. now, you\\'re very attractive, but you got a big waist. \\n\\njerry: hey, come on! \\n\\nkaren: no, no...it\\'s o.k. (to kramer) go on. \\n\\nkramer: well, i\\'d recommend a waist cincher. \\n\\nkaren: really. \\n\\nkramer: oh, yeah. just - thip! - suck you in. \\n\\njerry: i\\'ll be right back. (leaves the table.) \\n\\nkramer: so, what\\'s your talent? \\n\\nkaren: magic. \\n\\nkramer: mmm. i\\'m thinking of a number from one to ten. \\n\\nkaren: six. \\n\\nkramer: no, five. but you were close. \\n\\nannouncer #1: and the yankees take the field! \\n\\nannouncer #2: is it my imagination, or do the yankees look a little different tonight? i can\\'t put my finger on it... \\n\\nannouncer #1: well, from what i understand, they\\'ve switched to cotton uniforms. \\n\\nannouncer #2: they seem blousier, softer... \\n\\nannouncer #1: well, it is a natural fibre... \\n\\nkramer: how\\'s your evening? \\n\\nkaren: well, i\\'m wearing this red dress - \\n\\nkramer: stop right there. \\n\\nkaren: no good? \\n\\nkramer: disaster. \\n\\nkaren: why? \\n\\nkramer: well, you got brown eyes. you want to wear a green dress. \\n\\nkaren: that makes sense. (the limo stops at karen\\'s hotel.) \\n\\njerry: well, here we are... \\n\\nkaren: kramer, would you consider being my personal consultant for the pageant? \\n\\nkramer: okay. but if i\\'m going to do this, we play by my rules or we don\\'t play at all. \\n\\nkaren: i am in your hands. (they shake hands.) well! oh, good night, jerry. (they\\'re about to kiss, but kramer stops them by clearing his throat.) kenneth will take you home. (she gets out, leaving jerry staring at kramer with an angry expression on his face.) \\n\\nkramer: hey. \\n\\njerry: well, if it isn\\'t mr. blackwell. \\n\\nkramer: oh, come on. \\n\\njerry: and that waist cincher, that was the topper! \\n\\nkramer: oh, you\\'re poo-pooing! \\n\\njerry: yes, i poo-poo. \\n\\nkramer: well, let me tell you something. i\\'m taking this kid to the top. to the top, jerry! we\\'re going for the crown, and you can\\'t stop her! \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t want to stop her! \\n\\nkramer: you can\\'t stop her, jerry! oh, i\\'ve seen \\'em come and go, but this kid has got something! (turns to leave.) \\n\\njerry: yeah, so do you. (george enters with a newspaper.) \\n\\ngeorge: well, did you see it? \\n\\njerry: see what? \\n\\ngeorge: the uniforms! did you see how they played? listen to these comments! (reads from the paper) \"wade boggs \\'what a fabric! finally we can breathe.\\' luis palonia \\'cotton is king.\\' paul o\\'neill \\'i never dreamed anything could be so soft and fluffy.\\' \" \\n\\njerry: boy, they really do sound comfortable. \\n\\ngeorge (noticing jerry\\'s suitcase): hey, where ya goin\\'? \\n\\njerry: i\\'m working in atlantic city. \\n\\ngeorge: really! \\n\\njerry: yeah. hey, you\\'re not working this weekend, why don\\'t you come down? \\n\\ngeorge: atlantic city? (thinks) yes! yes! i will go to atlantic city. i\\'m in. i\\'m down. \\n\\njerry: you know what, maybe elaine wants to go too, lemme call her. (picks up the phone.) she\\'s at mr. pitt\\'s, i think i got the number... \\n\\nelaine: so, what do you think? \\n\\npitt (pulling up the socks): no. \\n\\nelaine: you don\\'t like them? \\n\\npitt: no, i don\\'t like them. \\n\\nelaine: what\\'s wrong? \\n\\npitt: they\\'re too tight. \\n\\nelaine: too tight? \\n\\npitt: there\\'s no elastic, you need to pull too much (pulls them up more). \\n\\nelaine (examining the socks): i think they look good! \\n\\npitt: they\\'re cutting off the circulation. \\n\\nelaine: alright, well, i\\'ll just take them back. (the phone rings.) \\n\\npitt: hello? \\n\\njerry: hi, mr. pitt! is elaine there? \\n\\npitt (hands the phone to elaine): it\\'s for you. \\n\\nelaine: sorry. hello? \\n\\njerry: hey elaine, it\\'s me. \\n\\nelaine: jerry? \\n\\njerry: we\\'re going to atlantic city. \\n\\nelaine: really? when? \\n\\njerry: today, right now! are you in? \\n\\nelaine: one second, hang on. (to mr. pitt) excuse me, mr. pitt? would it be alright if i got you the socks tomorrow? \\n\\npitt: tomorrow? \\n\\nelaine: yes. \\n\\npitt: but i was hoping for my new socks today! \\n\\nelaine: well, it\\'s just one more day. \\n\\npitt: i\\'m sorry. i must have them today. \\n\\nelaine (to jerry): i can\\'t go. \\n\\njerry: why not? \\n\\nelaine: because i have to return the socks and get different ones. \\n\\npitt: elaine! \\n\\nelaine: i gotta go. (hangs up.) \\n\\nkramer: no. alright, watch me now. (karen sits on the bed. kramer walks across the room like a miss america contestant with a big smile on his face.) turn, back, head up, shoulders back...posture. you see? posture. \\n\\nkaren: yes, i see. o.k. \\n\\nkramer: let\\'s try a few more questions, alright? (karen stands up.) if you were miss america, and the u.s. was on the brink of a nuclear war, and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep with the enemy\\'s leader, what would you do? \\n\\nkaren: kramer, are these questions really that important...? \\n\\nkramer: yes, they\\'re important! if you stumble, if you hesitate, you can kiss the crown goodbye. now if i\\'ve told you once, i\\'ve told you a thousand times - poise counts! it\\'s just as important as the others. swimsuit! evening wear! talent! poise! \\n\\ngeorge: hey. \\n\\njerry: hey. \\n\\ngeorge: how was the show? \\n\\njerry: good. how was the roulette? \\n\\ngeorge: i won fifty bucks! boy, this is great. too bad elaine\\'s not here. \\n\\njerry: yeah, all she had to do was buy mr. pitt a pair of socks! \\n\\npitt: it\\'s good, but... \\n\\nelaine: but what?? \\n\\npitt: ultimately i don\\'t think they\\'ll stay up. \\n\\nelaine (pulling up pitt\\'s socks): no, no! they\\'ll stay up! \\n\\npitt: for a while, yes, but not in the long run. \\n\\nelaine: but that\\'s why i got you the tighter ones! (holds them up.) \\n\\npitt: oh, forget about those! (takes the socks from elaine and throws them on the floor.) why do you keep mentioning those? \\n\\nelaine: what do you want!? \\n\\npitt: i want a decent sock that\\'s comfortable, that will stay on my foot!! \\n\\njerry: what the hell is that? \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t know, it sounds like pigeons or something! \\n\\njerry (getting out of bed): well, i can\\'t sleep with that noise. \\n\\ngeorge: me either. is there anything you can do to shut them up? \\n\\njerry: wait a second. (grabs the icebucket off the counter.) this\\'ll scare \\'em off. (dumps the bucket of water over the balcony. we hear a loud squawking noise and the flapping of wings, then the noise is gone. jerry gets back into bed.) well, good night, ollie. \\n\\ngeorge: good night, stan. \\n\\nkramer: what is it? \\n\\nkaren: my doves! they\\'re dead! i trained those birds for eight years! how am i supposed to do my magic act now? \\n\\nkramer: how did this happen? \\n\\nkaren: they like it outside, so i kept them in a cage on the terrace...then i found them dead in a pool of water! \\n\\nkramer (goes out on the terrace to look, and slips in the water): well, how did this happen? \\n\\nkaren: it must have been an accident. \\n\\nkramer: accident? this was no accident. these doves were murdered. \\n\\nkramer: well, that\\'s it! she\\'s out of the pageant! \\n\\njerry: what? why? what happened? \\n\\nkramer: her birds are dead. \\n\\njerry: birds? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, birds. she\\'s got these trained doves, she does this magic act, that was her talent for the pageant. you know what i think, jerry? i think somebody murdered those doves. somebody wanted her out of that contest bad. somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. somebody who just couldn\\'t stand to have the spotlight taken off of them! (kramer turns around and notices the empty icebucket on the edge of jerry\\'s balcony.) \\n\\njerry: what are you looking at? (kramer goes out onto the terrace and looks down.) oh, that! we had to leave that outside, last night, because the water was making the room too cold. \\n\\nkramer (comes back inside with his finger pointed at jerry): you killed them, didn\\'t you? \\n\\njerry: no, you don\\'t understand - it\\'s not what you think! it was an accident! \\n\\nkramer: well, don\\'t think you\\'ve won, because you haven\\'t! this kid is a fighter! and if you think i\\'m gonna let a couple of dead birds get in our way, you\\'re crazy! \\n\\njerry: kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened...! (kramer exits.) \\n\\ngeorge (comes out of the bathroom brushing his teeth): what was that all about? \\n\\njerry: oh, it was just kramer...apparently i killed miss rhode island\\'s doves with a bucket of water last night. \\n\\ngeorge: oh. (goes back into the bathroom.) \\n\\nkaren: o.k., this is it! \\n\\nkramer: how ya feelin\\'? \\n\\nkaren: i\\'m a little nervous! \\n\\nkramer: there\\'s nothing to be nervous about. \\n\\nkaren: but i\\'ve never sung before in my life! \\n\\nphilbin: and now, let\\'s welcome karen ann hanson, miss rhode island! \\n\\njerry: i heard those doves were really incredible. \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s a shame. (karen is shown singing off-key on the television.) \\n\\njerry: it\\'s like watching an animal get tortured. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, hey! yankee game! (changes the channel.) \\n\\njerry: oh, great! alright. (we hear the announcers calling the game.) \\n\\nannouncer #1: and the yankees take the field! \\n\\nannouncer #2: what is with the yankees? they look like they\\'re having trouble running, they can\\'t move! \\n\\nannouncer #1: it\\'s their uniforms, they\\'re too tight, they\\'ve shrunk! they\\'re running like penguins! forget this game! \\n\\nannouncer #2: oh my god, mattingly just split his pants! \\n\\njerry: that\\'s a shame. \\n\\nkramer: poise. poise! \\n\\nstationer: may i help you? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, uh, i\\'m looking for a rollamech 1000 mechanical pencil. \\n\\nstationer: oh, i know the rollamech 1000. \\n\\nelaine: no, i\\'m sure you do. \\n\\nstationer: they\\'re pretty expensive. \\n\\nelaine: well, it\\'s for my boss. \\n\\nstationer: what do you do? \\n\\nex: whatever. \\n\\nstationer: well, we don\\'t have any in stock right now but i would be happy to order it for you. just give me your phone number and when it comes in i\\'ll give you a call. you\\'re name is? \\n\\nelaine: elaine. \\n\\nstationer: elaine, . . . and your last name? \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s just elaine, like cher. ha ha ha \\n\\nstationer: and your number? \\n\\nelaine: uh, aw, kl5-239o. \\n\\nstationer: okay. thanks a lot. you\\'ll be hearing from me. \\n\\nelaine: okay, (to jerry) move along. . . \\n\\njerry: why did you give him my number? \\n\\nelaine: i think he\\'s got ideas. \\n\\njerry: i wonder if any woman ever said that about einstein? \\n\\njerry: call me when the pencil comes in okay? \\n\\nelaine: just call me when the new pen comes in, okay? \\n\\njerry: why does mr. pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway? hey. look who\\'s here. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, hey. \\n\\nelaine: hey hey \\n\\njulie: hi jerry. \\n\\njerry: hi julie. \\n\\ngeorge: elaine, julie. \\n\\nelaine: hi. \\n\\njulie: hi. \\n\\njulie: oh, hi. elaine\\'s my middle name. \\n\\nelaine: oh, mine\\'s \"ike\". \\n\\ngeorge: hey, wanna get some lunch? \\n\\njerry: just had a big bowl of kix. \\n\\ngeorge: ah, well, that\\'s very mature. what about you? \\n\\nelaine: ah, no. \\n\\njulie: please come, elaine. \\n\\nelaine: no, no. how about if you bring me back something? \\n\\ngeorge: sure, all right, what do you want? \\n\\nelaine: um, hum, i don\\'t know.. . . a big salad? \\n\\ngeorge: what big salad? i\\'m going to the coffee shop. \\n\\nelaine: they have big salads. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'ve never seen a big salad. \\n\\nelaine: they have a big salad. \\n\\ngeorge: is that what i ask for? the big salad? \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s okay, you don\\'t \\n\\ngeorge: no, no, hey i\\'ll get it. what\\'s in the big salad? \\n\\njerry: big lettuce, big carrots, tomatoes like volleyballs. \\n\\ngeorge: (???), we\\'ll see you in a little while. \\n\\nelaine: maybe i should just get married. \\n\\njerry: dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn\\'t it? \\n\\nelaine: i know. you know, whenever i\\'m on a date i feel people can tell. \\n\\njerry: people on dates shouldn\\'t even be allowed out in public. \\n\\nelaine: you can say that again. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s embarrassing for them. it\\'s painful for us to watch. i\\'m going out with someone later, i\\'m not even taking her out of the house. \\n\\nelaine: good for you. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t need a bunch of people staring at us. \\n\\nelaine: right on baby. (???) \\n\\njerry: what was that? \\n\\nkramer: that gendason, what a jerk. i\\'m never playing golf with him again. \\n\\nelaine: who gendason? \\n\\nkramer: steve gendason. \\n\\nelaine: why is that name familiar? \\n\\nhx: he used to be a baseball player. \\n\\nelaine: oh, how did you end up playing golf with him? \\n\\nkramer: well, i met him on the course a couple of years ago. yeah. played with him a lot. but today was it! we\\'re on the fifteenth hole, ya, he\\'s beating me by a couple of strokes. then, he\\'s about to hit his second shot, when, he picks up the ball and cleans it. \\n\\nelaine: so what? \\n\\nkramer: umph, sorry! but the rules clearly state that you cannot clean the ball unless it\\'s on the green. the rules are very clear about that. \\n\\njerry: certainly are. \\n\\nkramer: ya, so i penalized him a stroke. \\n\\nkramer: he lost it! we almost came to blows. we were face to face like a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . . \\n\\njerry: all right. you\\'re in my face. \\n\\nelaine: i still don\\'t see what the big deal is. \\n\\nkramer: a rule is a rule. and let\\'s face it. without rules there\\'s chaos. \\n\\njulie: i like anna quindlen\\'s column and safire. don\\'t you like safire? \\n\\ngeorge: oh, safire. uh ha \\n\\njulie: although at times can be rather pedantic. \\n\\ngeorge: he can be pedantic. he can be pedantic. \\n\\njulie: and bob herbert\\'s great. he\\'s the daily news. \\n\\ngeorge: yes. yes. you know what\\'s interesting. the quarterback for the atlanta falcons is bobby hebert. no \"r\" which i find fascinating. you know it\\'s herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. \"hebert\" it\\'s a fun name to pronounce. try and say it hebert. take a shot. all right. (check arrives) all right. i \\n\\njulie: no, no. i\\'d like to take you out. \\n\\ngeorge: no, julie, julie, don\\'t insult me. you know, what difference does it make who pays for lunch. it\\'s totally meaningless. \\n\\njulie: okay, thanks, george. \\n\\nwx: here\\'s your big salad to go. \\n\\njulie: oh, thank you. \\n\\njerry: (on phone) hello. no she\\'s not here. okay, fine, whatever. i\\'ll tell her. okay. goodbye. the stationery store guy called to say he ordered your pencil. \\n\\nelaine: i told ya\\'. he has ideas. \\n\\njerry: he doesn\\'t even care if a man answers. \\n\\nelaine: or you. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, hey. \\n\\nelaine: hey. \\n\\njulie: sorry e\\'re late. \\n\\nelaine: no problem. \\n\\njulie: here\\'s your big salad. \\n\\nelaine: thank you, julie. \\n\\njulie: oh, you\\'re very welcome. so, i guess i better get going. gotta meet mother a t the guggenheim. sure you don\\'t want to go? \\n\\ngeorge: no, you go guggenheim. i\\'m not much of a guggenheim. \\n\\njulie: sure, george. \\n\\ngeorge: ya, you go. \\n\\njulie: okay, i\\'ll see you later. goodbye. \\n\\njerry: bye bye \\n\\ngeorge: did you see what just happened? \\n\\njerry: well, that all depends. . . \\n\\ngeorge: did you happen to notice that julie handed the big salad to elaine? \\n\\njerry: yeah, so? \\n\\ngeorge: well, she didn\\'t buy the big salad. i bought the big salad. \\n\\njerry: is that a fact? \\n\\ngeorge: yes it is. she just took credit for my salad. that\\'s not right. \\n\\njerry: no it isn\\'t. \\n\\ngeorge: i mean i\\'m the one who bought it. \\n\\njerry: yes you did. \\n\\ngeorge: you think she should have said something? \\n\\njerry: she could have. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, i know. \\n\\njerry: imagine, her taking credit for your big salad. \\n\\ngeorge: you know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if they knew it. \\n\\njerry: obviously. \\n\\nkramer: turn on the tv. \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m puttin it on \\n\\ntv: . . . the district attorney\\'s office and the police department have not answered any questions as yet. to repeat in case you\\'re just joining us. former baseball start steve genderson, has been taken to police headquarters for questioning the murder of bobby pinkus the owner of royal dry cleaners at 2759 amsterdam avenue. according to pinkus\\' wife, gendeson had been involved in a dispute with the cleaner about a stain on a pair of gray sans-a-belt slacks. we also have a report that earlier in the day a groundskeeper at vancourtland\\'s golf course saw an irate gendeson leaving the clubhouse in a huff. whether there is a possible connection between the two is something we\\'ll just have to wait. \\n\\nkramer: jerry . . . \\n\\njerry: well, it has nothing to do with you. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner. \\n\\njerry: well, generally speaking you don\\'t need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner. i wouldn\\'t worry about that. \\n\\nelaine: i like julie. she\\'s very personable. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, she\\'s very lovely. \\n\\nelaine: that\\'s great george. \\n\\ngeorge: so did you enjoy your lunch? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, a big salad. very good. actually it was too big. ha ha ha wht? \\n\\ngeorge: oh, . . .because she handed you the bag. i could have handed you the bag. she happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though, . . . \\n\\nelaine: even though what? \\n\\ngeorge: . . . naw, it\\'s just you thanked her, and and oh, . . . what\\'s the difference? \\n\\nelaine: what? what are you trying to say, george? \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s just that i was the one who actually paid for the big salad. she just happened to hand it to you. but it\\'s no big deal. \\n\\nelaine: you want the money for the big salad, george? \\n\\ngeorge: no, no, \\n\\nelaine: what is the problem? \\n\\ngeorge: there is no problem. . . just a small miscommunication. whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing the big salad. \\n\\njerry: and kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it. \\n\\nmargaret: well, they haven\\'t even arrested him yet. come on, let\\'s go out. \\n\\njerry: ah, no , i don\\'t think so. \\n\\nmargaret: why not? \\n\\njerry: we don\\'t need a bunch of people staring at us. \\n\\nmargaret: who is staring? \\n\\njerry: oh, they\\'re staring. they know we\\'re on a date. they\\'re making fun. come on. it\\'s embarrassing. \\n\\njerry: hello. no she\\'s not here. yes i will tell her. no i don\\'t know what time she might be coming back. look i gotta\\' go. goodbye. . . . that, that\\'s a long story. \\n\\njerry: hello newman. \\n\\nmargaret: hello jerry, i was wondering if you knew where kramer was. \\n\\njerry: no, no i don\\'t. why? \\n\\nmargaret: you know, genderson. this is something big. \\n\\njerry: i suppose. \\n\\nmargaret: what did kramer say? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know. nothing.? \\n\\nmargaret: come on jerry. you know something tell me! tell me!, oh, chocolates . . . margaret? \\n\\nmargaret: hello. \\n\\njerry: you two know each other? \\n\\nnewman: you might say that. \\n\\nmargaret: we used to go out. \\n\\nnewman: well, tootle loo. and nice seeing you again margaret, goodbye jerry. have fun. hehe \\n\\njerry: . . . you went out with . . . newman? \\n\\nmargaret: just a few times. \\n\\njerry: why? \\n\\nmargaret: i liked him. \\n\\njerry: you liked, newman? \\n\\nmargaret: look i\\'m a little uncomfortable talking about this okay? \\n\\njerry: no, i\\'m sorry. i\\'m just a little curious. i mean why did you stop seeing him. \\n\\nmargaret: he ended it. \\n\\njerry: . . . he ended it? \\n\\nmargaret: yes!! yes! it was a couple of years ago. why does it matter? \\n\\njerry: no, no of course not. \\n\\nkramer: jerry, jerry they found a tee. \\n\\njerry: what tee? \\n\\nkramer: a golf tee. in the dry cleaner. \\n\\njerry: newman! she went out with newman! \\n\\nelaine: it must be a mistake. \\n\\njerry: no. it isn\\'t and the most distressing part of it is, not that she went out with him but that he stopped seeing her. do you understand? he, newman; newman stopped seeing her. newman never stopped seeing anybody. newman will see whoever is willing to see him. not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is. but why, did he, newman, stop seeing her? \\n\\nelaine: perhaps there\\'s more to him than meets the eye. \\n\\njerry: no, there\\'s less. \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s possible. \\n\\njerry: no it isn\\'t. i\\'ve looked into his eyes. he\\'s pure evil. \\n\\nelaine: he\\'s an enigma, a mystery wrapped in a riddle. \\n\\njerry: yeah, he\\'s a mystery wrapped in a twinkie. \\n\\nwx: would you like some more coffee? \\n\\njerry: no,, but thank you. \\n\\njerry: oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he\\'s got your pencil. \\n\\nelaine: ugh! you are kidding me. \\n\\njerry: no, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor and got it. \\n\\nelaine: i bought mine yesterday on 14th street. \\n\\njerry: well, what did you do that for? you ordered it. \\n\\nelaine: to please mr. pitt. \\n\\njerry: well, you better go down there and tell this guy. he\\'s very excited. \\n\\nelaine: uh, great! \\n\\njerry: hi julie. \\n\\njerry: hi. \\n\\nelaine: hi julie. \\n\\njerry: hi, how are you, elaine? i\\'m meeting george here. \\n\\nelaine: oh, well then i better get going otherwise george will make me buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday. \\n\\njerry: how do you know that? \\n\\nnewman: who is it. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s jerry. \\n\\nnewman: you\\'ve come at a bad time now. could you come back later? \\n\\njerry: come on newman. open the door! \\n\\nnewman: hellooo jerry. what a rare treat. what brings you down to the east wing? \\n\\njerry: okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. what happened with margaret? \\n\\nnewman: there\\'s no need to get excited. can\\'t we discuss this like gentlemen? \\n\\njerry: no, we can\\'t. my skin is crawling just being inside your little rat\\'s nest. now, what happened? \\n\\nnewman: do you really want to know what happened? i\\'ll tell you what happened. she wasn\\'t my type. \\n\\njerry: noit your type? \\n\\nnewman: not really. \\n\\njerry: well, how come? \\n\\nnewman: ah, she just didn\\'t do it for me. \\n\\njerry: what, what is wrong with her? \\n\\nnewman: well, h ha ha- if you\\'re happy with her, that\\'s all that matters. \\n\\njerry: you don\\'t think she\\'s attractive? \\n\\nnewman: no. i need a really pretty face. but, hey, that\\'s me. \\n\\njerry: okay, newman, thanks a lot. \\n\\nnewman: care for some lemonade? \\n\\njerry: no, thank you. \\n\\nnewman: drop bye anytime, jerry. hah, ha ha \\n\\nkramer: listen to this, \"if a player cleans his ball during the play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of one stroke. \" that\\'s a rule, jerry. \\n\\njerry: but it\\'s just a friendly game. why do you have to be such a stickler? \\n\\nkramer: because that\\'s the way i weas raised. you know when i was growing up i had to be in bed every night by nine o\\'clock. and if i wasn\\'t, well i don\\'t have to tell you what happened. \\n\\njerry: what are you so worried about this for? \\n\\nkramer: you know he talked about pinkus on the course? \\n\\njerry: he did? \\n\\nkramer: oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of pants into pinkus\\' and they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid. and pinkus denied responsibility. you see he was very upset with pinkus. \\n\\njerry: so it had nothing to do with you. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, but maybe i pushed him over the edge. \\n\\njerry: no, i don\\'t think so. \\n\\nkramer: poor pinkus, poor little pinkus. \\n\\njerry: hey, let me ask you a question. you met margaret. doo you think margaret\\'s good looking? um, she\\'s a natural beauty. oh, no makeup. i like that. \\n\\njerry: yeah, and the curls. you like the curls? \\n\\nkramer: oh, i love curls. \\n\\njerry: yeah,, me too. \\n\\nkramer: all right, i\\'ll see you later. \\n\\njerry: where you going? \\n\\nkramer: genderson\\'s. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re going to see genderson? \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s weighing on my conscience. \\n\\ngeorge: you know, i think i could have played with dolls if their were dolls in the house. it seems like fun to me. it doesn\\'t seem like a gender thing. i think i would like to play with dolls. what\\'s so terrible? \\n\\njulie: ha. so, george, i was talking to elaine before. \\n\\ngeorge: a ha! we\\'re just friends. \\n\\njulie: yes, well anyway, she said something that was kind of intriguing. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, share. \\n\\njulie: well, when i came over to the table she mentioned something about how she better hurry up and leave or you\\'d make her buy lunch to make up for the one you bought yesterday. \\n\\ngeorge: ha, ha ha uh, i\\'m not following that. \\n\\njulie: well, my question is, how could elaine be under the impression that you bought the big salad, when i was the one who handed it to her? \\n\\ngeorge: well, she probably just assumed. \\n\\njulie: um, did she? \\n\\ngeorge: . . .uh, . . . wait a second. are you suggesting that i went out of my way to tell elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, that it came from me? \\n\\njulie: that\\'s what i\\'m suggesting. \\n\\ngeorge: . . . well it was a big salad. and what i would like to know is, how does a person who has nothing to do with the big salad claim responsibility for that salad and accept the thank you under false pretenses - ah - ah? \\n\\njulie: george, all i did was hand someone a bag. \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil right away. \\n\\nstationer: well,, why did you tell me to order it if you knew you were going to get one someplace else? \\n\\nelaine: no, no no i didn\\'t know. i, i\\'m sorry. \\n\\nstationer: i went all the way down to the warehouse. it took me three hours. i had a big fight with the foreman. \\n\\nelaine: really? a fight with the foreman? \\n\\nstationer: yes. \\n\\nelaine: well, again, i\\'m just awfully sorry. \\n\\nstationer: yeah? well, then how about going out with me tonight? \\n\\nelaine: okay. \\n\\nmargaret: i mean they found a tee and he played golf that day. nobody walks into a dry cleaner\\'s with a tee. the circumstantial evidence is overwhelming. \\n\\njerry: you had how many dates with him? three? \\n\\nmargaret: around three. i don\\'t know. \\n\\njerry: and . . \\n\\nmargaret: i told you. he stopped calling me. i moved on. i\\'m not hung up on him. what are you looking at? \\n\\njerry: what? i\\'m not looking. nothing. \\n\\njerry: why are you looking at my face? \\n\\njerry: where am i going to look? \\n\\nmargaret: kiss me. \\n\\njerry: . . . i can\\'t. \\n\\njerry: newman! \\n\\njerry: all i could think of was when i was looking at her face was; newman found this unacceptable. \\n\\nelaine: well, ,i\\'m going out with the stationery store guy. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re going out with the stationery store guy? \\n\\nelaine: i felt so guilty about the pencil i couldn\\'t say no. \\n\\nelaine: well, well, well, i\\'m not treating you to lunch anymore! you had to tell julie that i made a special point of telling you that i bought you the big salad. didn\\'t ya\\'. \\n\\nelaine: uh, uh. \\n\\ngeorge: you know, if it was a regular salad i wouldn\\'t have said anything. but you had to have the big salad. \\n\\njerry: hello, what? you\\'re kidding. i\\'m turning it on. oh, my god. get out of here. (hangs up) hey listen to this. they issued a warrant for genderson\\'s arrest. he escaped and the police spotted him on the new jersey turnpike. \\n\\ntv: as you can see white bronco. the police have cleared the highway traffic in front of him but they are keeping their distance and don\\'t want the situation to escalate. and we have gotten an identification on the driver of the vehicle. his name is; kramer, one of genderson\\'s golfing buddies. \\n\\npolice: 9-1-1 what are you reporting \\n\\nkramer: yeah, this is kramer. i got genderson in the car. he wants to see his fish. i\\'m taking him to see his fish. so tell the police to back off. \\n\\npolice: okay, sir, and what\\'s your name? \\n\\nkramer: my name is kramer. you know who i am dammit! \\n\\ngenderson: i told you not to take the turnpike. \\n\\nkramer: i thought we would blend in. \\n\\ngenderson: if we took the palisades this never have happened. \\n\\nkramer: we would have had all that bridge traffic. \\n\\ngenderson: ah, just drive. \\n\\nelaine: she was hitting on you? my friend noreen? \\n\\njerry: your friend, noreen. \\n\\nelaine: are you sure you\\'re not just flattering yourself? \\n\\njerry: if i was flattering myself, i think i\\'d come up with someone a little less annoying than noreen. \\n\\nelaine: i cannot believe that she was hitting on you. \\n\\njerry: if you don\\'t believe me, ask her. \\n\\nelaine: i will. besides, she\\'s got a boyfriend, jerry, you know him. dan. remember, we went to that party at his house? \\n\\njerry: oh, right. the guy who talks with a really high voice. \\n\\nelaine: yeah. \\n\\nkramer: jerry, did you get my fortune magazine in your mail? \\n\\njerry: check the pile. \\n\\nkramer: (leafing through jerry\\'s mail) oh, who sent you a card? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know. \\n\\nkramer: open it, it\\'s from hallmark. \\n\\njerry: oh. \\n\\nelaine: hello, darling. \\n\\njerry: isn\\'t that cute, a \\'thank you\\' card from kristin. \\n\\nkramer: let me see. \\n\\nelaine: who\\'s kristin? \\n\\njerry: she works for pbs, i met her when i agreed to do that pledge drive. \\n\\nkramer: did you ask her about me? \\n\\njerry: yeah, in fact she said that you could be one of those people that sits in the back and answers the phone. \\n\\nkramer: giddy-up! alright! so now, how does that work? now, what, i get a percentage of every pledge i bring in, right? \\n\\njerry: no, it\\'s not aluminum siding, it\\'s volunteer work. all the money goes to the station. \\n\\nkramer: okay, yeah, alright, that sounds good, but i still get a tote bag though, right? \\n\\njerry: yeah, and one of those foam beer can holders. \\n\\nelaine: (dialing the phone) you know what i\\'m doing? i\\'m calling noreen. \\n\\njerry: oh, go ahead. \\n\\nelaine: you sure you don\\'t mind? \\n\\njerry: like she\\'s really going to admit she was flirting with me. \\n\\nhigh pitched voice: hello? \\n\\nelaine: hi, it\\'s elaine. listen, i was just talking to jerry. \\n\\nhigh pitched voice: jerry? \\n\\nelaine: jerry seinfeld. \\n\\nhigh pitched voice: oh, i like jerry a lot. \\n\\nelaine: you mean like like? \\n\\nhigh pitched voice: what are you talking about? \\n\\nelaine: noreen, were you hitting on him? \\n\\nhigh pitched voice: noreen\\'s not here, this is dan. \\n\\nelaine: ooh. \\n\\ndan: you say that noreen was hitting on jerry seinfeld? \\n\\nelaine: uh oh. \\n\\njerry: so was i right? she likes me, right? \\n\\nelaine: oh, i\\'m sorry mr. pitt. hello? \\n\\nhigh pitched voice: elaine? what is going on? why did you tell dan i was hitting on jerry seinfeld? \\n\\nelaine: is this noreen? \\n\\nhigh pitched voice: (noreen) what would ever possess you to make up a story like that. \\n\\nelaine: well, listen, jerry mentioned it, and, i don\\'t know-- \\n\\nelaine: noreen, are you crying? \\n\\ndan: no, this is dan! \\n\\nelaine: oh, hi dan. \\n\\nmr. pitt: elaine? work? \\n\\nelaine: tell noreen i\\'ll just call her back later. \\n\\nmr. pitt: who was crying? \\n\\nelaine: no one. i\\'m sorry mr. pitt, that won\\'t happen again. \\n\\nmr. pitt: (unwrapping a candy bar, placing it on a plate and cutting it with knife and fork) i\\'m sure it won\\'t, but someone was crying and i want to know who it was. \\n\\nelaine: well, it\\'s a long story, okay? but my stupid friend jerry told my other friend noreen that she was-- (noticing mr. pitt eating the candy bar with knife and fork and becoming distracted) you know, hitting on him and so i called her to see what was, uh, going on and i accidentally got her boyfriend, who is this, you know-- \\n\\njerry: i\\'m jerry seinfeld, i tell jokes for a living, but there\\'s no joking about the financial crisis at pbs. show us you care. call in your pledge now. \\n\\nkristin: jerry, i am so grateful that you\\'re doing this. \\n\\njerry: oh, i know you are. \\n\\nkristin: you got the card i sent? \\n\\njerry: i did. \\n\\nkristin: so where is it? \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nkristin: the card. is this it in the trash? \\n\\njerry: no? \\n\\nkristin: this is my card, you threw it away. \\n\\njerry: well-- \\n\\nkristin: i put a lot of thought into this card. \\n\\njerry: you signed your name and you addressed the envelope, it\\'s not like you painted the picture and wrote the poem. \\n\\nkristin: fine. i gotta get back to the office. \\n\\njerry: why, because i threw the card out? how long was i supposed to save it? \\n\\nkristin: you have no sentimentality. \\n\\njerry: i have sentimentality, really, i\\'m sentimental. here, look. here\\'s some cards i\\'ve saved, these are birthday cards from my grandmother, see, i\\'m not a bad guy. \\n\\nkristin: oh, so you save her cards but not mine! oh great! \\n\\njerry: (as kristin is storming out) well, but, you see, i saved something! see? i can save. i\\'ll see you at the pledge drive, ok? \\n\\nkramer: new cards, huh? \\n\\njerry: no, they\\'re old cards from my grandmother. \\n\\nkramer: oh. well, i\\'ll tell you, a nice greeting card can really lift a person\\'s spirits. \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\nkramer: (opening a card) oh, a check. \\n\\njerry: yeah, she puts ten dollars in every card for my birthday, that\\'s why i save them. \\n\\nkramer: there\\'s a check in all these? why don\\'t you cash them? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know, it\\'s ten dollars. \\n\\nkramer: but you got a whole pile here. 1987? \\n\\njerry: oh so what. \\n\\nkramer: jerry, your grandmother gave you this gift. she wants you to spend the money, to have the fun that she can\\'t have. oh, this is tantamount to a slap in the face. \\n\\njerry: oh, get out of here. \\n\\nkramer: jerry, a gift not enjoyed is like a flower that doesn\\'t blossom. \\n\\njerry: alright, alright, i\\'ll cash the checks. \\n\\nkramer: yeah. \\n\\njerry: it was a \\'thank you\\' card from kristin because i\\'m doing the pbs drive. i mean, how long am i supposed to keep it? \\n\\ngeorge: the rule is a minimum of two days. \\n\\njerry: you making that up or do you know what you\\'re talking about? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m making it up. \\n\\njerry: i mean really, what\\'s the point of saving it? i could see if i had a mantel. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, well, a mantel\\'s a whole different story. \\n\\njerry: absolutely. \\n\\ngeorge: if my parents had a mantel, i might be a completely different person. \\n\\njerry: so anyway, she\\'s kind of upset about it so i need you to do me a favor. \\n\\ngeorge: let\\'s have it. \\n\\njerry: well, i\\'m doing the pbs show, so during the show they\\'re gonna be running the ken burns baseball thing. so i thought if i could get a baseball player to come on the show with me... \\n\\ngeorge: you want me to ask one of the yankees. \\n\\njerry: could you? \\n\\ngeorge: alright. i\\'ll run it by a few people. \\n\\njerry: alright, do your thing, where you lie to everyone. \\n\\nelaine: (entering and sitting down) i should never have made that phone call. \\n\\njerry: hey, did you ever get to talk to noreen? \\n\\nelaine: yes, she\\'s very upset. \\n\\njerry: so was i right about the flirting? was it true? \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t know, i never asked. she was yelling-- \\n\\ngeorge: who was flirting with you? \\n\\njerry: remember when we were in the bookstore, that woman came up to us? \\n\\ngeorge: she wasn\\'t flirting with you. \\n\\njerry: oh, sure she was; asked me where the \\'humor\\' section was? humor? come on. \\n\\nelaine: jerry, her brother just had a book of political cartoons published. \\n\\njerry: alright, so maybe she wasn\\'t flirting with me. so what? \\n\\nelaine: so, yeah, that\\'s funny. hey, you wanna hear something weird? mr. pitt eats his snickers bars with a knife and fork. \\n\\ngeorge: really? \\n\\nelaine: yeah. \\n\\njerry: why does he do that? \\n\\ngeorge: he probably doesn\\'t want to get chocolate on his fingers. that\\'s the way these society types eat their candy bars. \\n\\njerry: oh, you know. \\n\\ngeorge: what, you think i eat all my meals with you? (to waitress) excuse me, sweetheart? i think you may have overcharged us. what is this? \\n\\nwaitress: that\\'s the extra toast. get it? \\n\\ngeorge: got it. (the waitress walks away) did you just see what happened here? \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\ngeorge: did you see the way she pointed at the check? she gave me the finger. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s how waitress types express derision. they don\\'t want to get their mouths dirty. \\n\\ngeorge: so, what do you think? \\n\\nmr. morgan: a pbs fundraiser? i\\'m not gonna waste any of the players\\' time with that, besides the team already does so much promotion for channel eleven. \\n\\ngeorge: channel eleven? forgive me for trying to class up this place, for trying to have the yankees reach another strata of society that might not watch channel eleven. \\n\\nmr. morgan: uh, what the hell are you doing? \\n\\ngeorge: i am eating my dessert. how do you eat it, with your hands? \\n\\nmr. morgan: you know, maybe george has something here about pbs. \\n\\njerry: okay, sixty bucks from nana. \\n\\nkramer: huh? yeah. \\n\\nnana: hello? \\n\\nvoice: hello, this is chemical bank. just wanted you to know that your checking account is overdrawn. \\n\\nnana: chemical bank? i haven\\'t used that account in months. \\n\\nvoice: well, someone\\'s been cashing the checks and you\\'re overdrawn. \\n\\nnana: oh dear. i\\'ll be down there first thing in the morning. \\n\\nvoice: (unheard by nana as she hangs up the phone) wait, we can do this over the phone. \\n\\n(fade to the next morning, the alarm clock goes off, it\\'s 5: 30, nana turns off the alarm, fully dressed, gathers her coat and purse, sighs, and heads for the door.) \\n\\njerry: you got danny tartabull?! \\n\\ngeorge: you wanted a yankee, i got you a yankee. \\n\\njerry: boy, you really came through. kristin\\'s gonna be thrilled. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, the bull owes me one, i helped him with his swing. \\n\\nkramer: so you\\'re bringing danny tartabull to the fundraiser tonight. \\n\\ngeorge: absolutely. pending approval of the script. \\n\\njerry: excuse me? \\n\\ngeorge: jerry, i\\'m yankee management. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, i\\'d like to see the script too. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re just answering phones! \\n\\nkramer: it would put me at ease. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, when you order from the waitress, get her to point to the menu. i want to see what finger she uses. \\n\\njerry: uh, say, i wanted a side order of fruit but i didn\\'t see it on the men \\n\\nwaitress: oh, you\\'re getting it (pointing to menu with index finger), it comes with your breakfast special. \\n\\njerry: right you are. \\n\\ngeorge: i didn\\'t get the special, but i\\'d also like the fresh fruit too. \\n\\nwaitress: (scratching cheek with middle finger) i\\'ll check. \\n\\ngeorge: (after waitress walks away) i don\\'t believe it, she did it again! \\n\\njerry: oh, she had an itch. \\n\\ngeorge: she had an itch. she could have used any one of those fingers. that finger was meant for me. \\n\\njerry: by the way, lunch is on me. i just cashed my nana\\'s birthday checks. \\n\\nstreet tough: looking for something, lady? \\n\\nnana: isn\\'t the chemical bank on this block? \\n\\nstreet tough: the bank? it burned. it\\'s gone! \\n\\nnana: oh dear. \\n\\njerry: (answering) hello? \\n\\nuncle leo: jerry? hello. \\n\\njerry: uncle leo! \\n\\nuncle leo: listen, i don\\'t want to alarm you, but your nana is missing. \\n\\njerry: nana\\'s missing? \\n\\nuncle leo: i came to pick her up for a doctor\\'s appointment, she wasn\\'t here. i called the doctor, nobody knows where she is. she hasn\\'t left the apartment in twenty-five years! \\n\\njerry: i\\'ve been thinking about her, i just cashed some of her checks. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, that\\'s right. you did. \\n\\nuncle leo: what kind of checks? \\n\\njerry: i think chemical bank. \\n\\nkramer: oh, they were chemical. \\n\\nuncle leo: chemical?! she hasn\\'t used that account since her branch closed. what are you doing cashing her checks anyway? \\n\\njerry: well, kramer thought it would make her happy. (to kramer) i never should have cashed those checks! \\n\\nkramer: hey, i didn\\'t twist your arm. \\n\\nuncle leo: your grandmother\\'s on a very fixed income. what, are you broke? \\n\\njerry: just call me if you hear anything. (hangs up and faces kramer) well? i cashed the checks, the checks bounced and now my nana\\'s missing! \\n\\nkramer: well, don\\'t look at me. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s your fault! \\n\\nkramer: my fault? your nana is missing because she\\'s been passing those bum checks all over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people. \\n\\nnoreen: so anyway, it\\'s caused a lot of problems. dan thinks i\\'m interested in jerry, he won\\'t let up. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m really sorry, but you can see why i\\'d make a mistake like that. \\n\\nnoreen: no, why? \\n\\nelaine: well, you know, because he\\'s a high talker. \\n\\nnoreen: he does raise his voice occasionally, but that\\'s normal. \\n\\nelaine: no. no, no, no, not a loud talker, a high talker. \\n\\nnoreen: really? \\n\\nelaine: you don\\'t think his voice sounds a lot like yours? \\n\\nnoreen: i never noticed that. \\n\\nelaine: well, it\\'s no big deal, you know, it\\'s just that he can sound like a woman, you know? \\n\\nnoreen: great. i\\'m going out with a man who sounds like a woman. \\n\\nelaine: well, he looks like a man. \\n\\nnoreen: yeah. \\n\\nelaine: he\\'s bald. i know that\\'s a guy thing. \\n\\nnoreen: i guess. \\n\\nelaine: i know he belches a lot. \\n\\nnoreen: well, that\\'s something. so, jerry thought i was flirting with him. \\n\\nelaine: yeah. \\n\\nnoreen: (cutting into a cookie with a knife and fork) hm. he\\'s kind of a baritone, isn\\'t he? \\n\\nelaine: what are you doing? \\n\\nnoreen: i\\'m eating this cookie. \\n\\nelaine: no, no, no, but why are you using a knife and a fork? did you just \\n\\nnoreen: no, i\\'ve seen people do it. i like it. \\n\\ndanny tartabull: this isn\\'t gonna take long, is it? \\n\\ngeorge: oh no, in and out, i made sure of that. and you\\'ll be happy to know i perused the script and it\\'s met with my approval. \\n\\ndanny tartabull: i\\'m sure it\\'s fine. \\n\\ngeorge: (swerving) hey! watch it! did you see that guy? he just gave me the finger! \\n\\ndanny tartabull: you sure? \\n\\ngeorge: oh yeah! middle finger, straight up, at me! at us! \\n\\ndanny tartabull: what are you doing? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m following him. \\n\\nbanker: i\\'m sorry, the account had insufficient funds. we had to return the \\n\\nnana: oh dear, that\\'s my grandson. may i call him now and explain? \\n\\nbanker: oh, certainly. \\n\\nelaine: and now i think she might really be interested in you. and dan is \\n\\njerry: would you? \\n\\nelaine (answering): hello? \\n\\nnana: hello, i need to speak to jerry. \\n\\nelaine (thinking it\\'s dan): oh, it\\'s you. we were just talking about you. \\n\\nelaine (hanging up): heh? \\n\\nkramer: any word from nana? \\n\\njerry: no. \\n\\nelaine: nana? \\n\\njerry: yeah, my grandma\\'s missing. \\n\\nelaine: missing? \\n\\njerry: yeah. i think it might have something to do with those checks. \\n\\nelaine: um, what does nana sound like? \\n\\njerry: like a grandmother, why? \\n\\nelaine: well... \\n\\njerry: oh, you hung up on my nana?! \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t know, maybe. \\n\\njerry: you told nana to drop dead?! \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s possible. \\n\\njerry: yes, it is! \\n\\nkramer: alright, alright. look, jerry, we gotta get down to pbs, pdq. \\n\\njerry: alright. \\n\\ngeorge: no one gives us the finger! we\\'re yankees! \\n\\ndanny tartabull: want this last donut?

\\n\\njerry: he\\'ll be here any second. \\n\\nkristin: you know you guys are both on in five minutes. \\n\\njerry: yeah, yeah. \\n\\nkristin: (leaving) okay. \\n\\nuncle leo: why didn\\'t you tell me you were a little short? here. if anybody asks you where you got it, you don\\'t know. \\n\\njerry: no, that\\'s ok, i really don\\'t need any money. \\n\\nuncle leo: what are you talking about? \\n\\njerry: please- \\n\\nuncle leo: i want- \\n\\njerry: it\\'s not necessary. \\n\\nuncle leo: jerry, would you please take it. \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t, i can\\'t take it. \\n\\nuncle leo: i want you to have it! \\n\\njerry: uncle leo, i don\\'t want to have it! \\n\\nuncle leo: jerry, take the money! \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t want it!! \\n\\nhigh pitched voice: jerry, open up. we need to talk. \\n\\nkramer: who\\'s that?

\\n\\nkramer: look, i\\'m not judging you. in fact, we here at pbs, we have many programs celebrating your lifestyle. armistead maupin\\'s tales of the city, gender bending and swinging in san francisco. before stonewall about those dark ages when you couldn\\'t come out of the closet, lest you be persecuted because of your, you know. \\n\\ndan: no, i don\\'t. \\n\\nkristin: (running up) are you danny tartabull? \\n\\ndan: no, i\\'m not. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'ll take care of this, danny. \\n\\ngeorge: excuse me. \\n\\nman: what\\'s the problem? \\n\\ngeorge: i believe you cut me off, and then made an obscene gesture. \\n\\nman: i did? where? \\n\\ngeorge: outside of manhattan, about an hour ago. \\n\\nman: wow! is that danny tartabull? \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s right, of the new york yankees. \\n\\nman: i\\'d like to shake his hand but i can\\'t. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m jerry seinfeld, i tell jokes for a living, but there\\'s no joking about the financial crisis here at pbs. our lines are open, so please call the number you see on your screen. \\n\\njerry: this is the only time this year we\\'ll be asking for donations. you\\'ve been enjoying ken burns\\' baseball- \\n\\nkramer: (answering) pbs pledge drive. \\n\\nnana: hello, i\\'d like to speak with jerry. \\n\\nkramer: oh, you again. buddy, look, forget about jerry. it\\'s not gonna happen. \\n\\nnana: this is his grandmother. \\n\\nkramer: oh, uh, nana. hello. \\n\\nnana: tell jerry i\\'m sorry, i\\'m going to have to write him some new checks. \\n\\nkramer: as long as you\\'ve got your checkbook out, how about forking a little over to pbs? you watch the station, don\\'t you? you don\\'t want to be a freeloader. \\n\\njerry: -programs like ken burns\\' baseball. and if danny tartabull were here, i\\'m sure he\\'d say, \\'that\\'s correct, jerry.\\' \\n\\nkramer: jerry? i have an announcement. your grandmother is on the line. \\n\\njerry: my nana? \\n\\nkramer: and as we speak, she\\'s generously writing pbs a check for fifteen hundred dollars! \\n\\nuncle leo: she can\\'t do that, she\\'s on a very fixed income! stop the show!! \\n\\njerry: i got another card from kristin. not quite as chipper as the first one. \\n\\nelaine: wow. isn\\'t this little bunny giving you the- \\n\\njerry: yes, he is. \\n\\nelaine: you should show this to georgie. \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\nwaitress: (at the next table) here\\'s your knife and fork. \\n\\njerry: look, she\\'s cutting up an almond joy. \\n\\nelaine: i just don\\'t get it. \\n\\njerry: you know, i saw someone on the street eating m&ms with a spoon. \\n\\nelaine: what is wrong with everybody? \\n\\njerry: (surveying the restaurant) look, they\\'re doing it. they\\'re all doing it! \\n\\nelaine: (standing up) what is wrong with all you people?! have you all gone mad?!! \\n\\ni think the thing i admire most about the chinese is that they\\'re hanging in there with the chopsticks. because, if you think about it, you know, they\\'ve seen the fork... by now. i\\'m sure they\\'ve seen the spoon, they\\'re going, \"yeah, yeah, they\\'re ok... we\\'re going to stay with the sticks.\" i mean, i don\\'t know how they\\'ve missed it: thousands of years ago, chinese farmer gets up, has his breakfast with the chopsticks, goes out and works all day in the field with a shovel... hello?... shovel! not going out there ploughing 40 acres with a couple of pool cues. \\n\\njerry: (feeling face) good shave today... \\n\\nelaine: (sarcastic) don\\'t worry, jerry, i can manage these bags; really i\\'m fine. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m thinkin\\' of lettin\\' my sideburns grow in a little... \\n\\nelaine: can we rest here a second. \\n\\njerry: (pause) yeah, i guess. \\n\\njerry: ...so how\\'s noreen? \\n\\nelaine: mmm! she\\'s got a new boyfriend paul. \\n\\njerry: already? that was fast... i assume he\\'s not a high talker... \\n\\nelaine: no, but... he has... the worst habit. whenever he answers the phone, he won\\'t put noreen right on. ya have\\'ta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat. \\n\\njerry: a long talker. \\n\\nelaine: yeah! and he is so boring! but now, whenever he answers the phone i just hang up. \\n\\njerry: (pause) all right; let\\'s move it out. \\n\\njerry: hey, isn\\'t that george\\'s father? \\n\\nelaine: oh, yeah, it is! shall we say hello? \\n\\njerry: i\\'ve never seen him in manhattan before; it\\'s weird. so out of context. \\n\\nelaine: that man he\\'s with is he wearing a cape? \\n\\njerry: i believe he is wearing a cape. \\n\\nelaine: why is mr. costanza with a man in a cape? \\n\\njerry: well, it is good cape weather. cool. breezy. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, why a cape? who wears a cape? where do you even get a cape? \\n\\njerry: you\\'re right; it is strange. in fact, let\\'s cross to the other side of the street. cover me. \\n\\njerry: just, uh, plop it on the counter there. \\n\\njerry: oh! i got a message. (presses button on answer machine) \\n\\ngeorge: (on tape, lifeless) hey, it\\'s george. i got nothin\\' to say... (beep) \\n\\nelaine: that sounds urgent... \\n\\njerry: let me call him back... hello? who is this? donna chang? oh, i\\'m sorry, i must o\\' dialed the wrong number. \\n\\nelaine: donna chang? \\n\\njerry: (is redialing) i should\\'ve talked to her; i love chinese women. \\n\\nelaine: isn\\'t that a little racist? \\n\\njerry: if i like their race, how can that be racist?... hellooo??... oh, is this donna chang again?!... yyy-yes, i am calling george... oh, the lines are crossed! you\\'re getting his calls. well, what do you know?! \\n\\njerry: so listen... \\n\\nkramer: hi. i\\'m goin\\' through this stuff like water... (to jerry) who you talkin\\' to? (jerry waves him away and moves towards the bedroom, still on the phone) \\n\\nelaine: he\\'s on with a chinese woman. \\n\\nkramer: oooo, ooooo. you know, i dig asian women. \\n\\nelaine: you got a comfort problem there? \\n\\nkramer: no, i think these jockeys shrunk. \\n\\nelaine: i thought you wore silk underwear. \\n\\nkramer: no, no, n--well, you know, i wore \\'em for about a month but i couldn\\'t stick with it. no, i need the secure packaging of jockeys. (he\\'s serious. then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up) my boys need a house! \\n\\nelaine: (not charmed) that\\'s nice. listen, kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn\\'t wear briefs. boxers are much better for your sperm count. \\n\\nkramer: sperm count? well how many ssssperm should i have? \\n\\nelaine: a lot! \\n\\njerry: i got a date! \\n\\nelaine: with the chinese woman?! \\n\\njerry: she knew who i was! she saw me in a club one time! my first date ever with the pacific rim. i\\'m very excited. \\n\\nkramer: jerry. did ya ever have your sperm count checked? \\n\\njerry: no, why should i? i wear boxers. \\n\\nkramer: you ever get a woman pregnant? \\n\\njerry: i\\'m sorry, kramer. those records are permanently sealed... \\n\\nkramer: what would you say if i told you i never impregnated a woman? \\n\\njerry: really? you never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??... boy, i\\'m surprised. you\\'ve slept with a lot of women! \\n\\nkramer: a lot of \\'em! (wild gesture, freaked out) do you think maybe i\\'m... depleted??!! \\n\\njerry: well, i\\'m sure you\\'re not... totally depleted. \\n\\nkramer: yeah but what if i am? i\\'m the last... male kramer! we\\'re facing extinction! \\n\\njerry: so go to a fertility clinic. have your sperm count checked. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, but then i\\'d have to... (glances at elaine) well, you know... into a cup in the middle of the day?? \\n\\nelaine: what, does that conflict with your regular schedule? \\n\\nelaine: (going to the phone) all right. i\\'m gonna try noreen again. \\n\\njerry: i am very excited about this date! we\\'re goin\\' to hunan balcony! \\n\\nelaine: she\\'s chinese so you suggest chinese food? \\n\\njerry: she suggested it! \\n\\nelaine: i thought chinese don\\'t eat chinese... \\n\\njerry: she\\'s very assimilated. \\n\\njerry: paul again? \\n\\nelaine: (matter of fact) you can\\'t get one ring past him. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, hey, hey! you don\\'t call me back?! \\n\\njerry: i tried! your line\\'s crossed with a chinese woman! \\n\\ngeorge: ...huh? \\n\\nelaine: hey, george, we saw your father on the street before. \\n\\ngeorge: hmm, what\\'s he doin\\' in the city today? \\n\\ngeorge: you didn\\'t ask him? \\n\\ngeorge: (suspicious) you didn\\'t say hello? \\n\\nelaine: well, he was with someone. a man... in a cape. \\n\\ngeorge: why was he wearing a cape? \\n\\ngeorge: was my father wearing a cape? \\n\\njerry: no. jacket and tie no cape. \\n\\ngeorge: huh... cape... (turns, distracted, heads slowly towards door) what was a man with a cape doin\\' with my father?... what was my father doing with a man in a cape?... (opens door) why a cape? hmm! (exits) \\n\\ndoctor: the results of your sperm test are in. \\n\\nkramer: oh? \\n\\ndoctor: ummm... are you planning to start a family? \\n\\nkramer: yes! i would like to very much!... well, i\\'m low, aren\\'t i? i ca--i can feel it!... \\n\\ndoctor: yes, i\\'m afraid you\\'re a little low. \\n\\nkramer: ohhh, maaan!! it\\'s over! the kramer name is finished! i\\'m never goin\\' to procreate-- \\n\\ndoctor: ah--that\\'s not necessarily true. \\n\\nkramer: what \\n\\ndoctor: there are measures you can take to improve your fertility. \\n\\nkramer: all right, all right. what. what. you tell me; i\\'ll do anything. come on, doc, tell me. \\n\\ndoctor: first thing you should wear boxer shorts. \\n\\nkramer: all the time? \\n\\ndoctor: all the time. ya have to get off jockeys right away. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, but i\\'ve always worn jockeys. \\n\\nelaine: hi paul! it\\'s elaine calling! yeah, i\\'m calling from a car phone so i don\\'t really have time to talk. is, is, uh, noreen there?!... oh. she\\'s not?!

(coming out of bathroom) you know what i just realized?! if they get divorced an\\' live in two separate places? that\\'s twice as many visits! \\n\\njerry: gee, i never thought of that. \\n\\ngeorge: imagine if i had to see them both on the same day? (mirthless) haha! it\\'s like runnin\\' a double marathon! \\n\\nelaine: hey georgie, did you have any idea that anything was wrong? \\n\\njerry: have you ever spent any time with these people...? \\n\\ngeorge: you know what this has to do with? \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\ngeorge: the man in the cape--i bet you he is mixed up in this! i don\\'t trust men in capes. \\n\\njerry: and you can\\'t cast aspersions on someone just because they\\'re wearin\\' a cape... superman wore a cape... an\\' i\\'ll be damned if i\\'m gonna stand here an\\' let you say something bad about him. \\n\\ngeorge: all right superman\\'s the exception. \\n\\nkramer: oh, hey! elaine, i just heard that noreen and paul are breaking up. i want you to put in a good word for me. (to jerry) i\\'ve always had a thing for noreen. \\n\\nelaine: no, kramer. you don\\'t understand. this could be my fault. \\n\\nkramer: well, if she\\'s available now, i\\'m not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. nooope. (does a little dance) \\n\\njerry: well it looks like you\\'ve adjusted to the boxers... \\n\\nkramer: wellll, i wouldn\\'t go as far as that. \\n\\njerry: you went back to the jockeys? \\n\\nkramer: wrong again. \\n\\njerry: (pause as he realizes) oh, no. \\n\\nelaine: what? what?... \\n\\njerry: don\\'t you see what\\'s goin\\' on here???... no boxers, no jockeys... \\n\\nelaine: (backing away from kramer) eeaawww... \\n\\njerry: the only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine... kramer, say it isn\\'t so. \\n\\nkramer: oh, it be so. i\\'m out there, jerry, an\\' i\\'m lllovin\\' every minute of it!!! \\n\\njerry: don\\'t you need a little... help? \\n\\nkramer: surprisingly, no. i\\'m freee, i\\'m unfettered... (opens door to leave, still very happy, then) feel like a naked innocent boy rrroamin\\' the countryside!! (exits) \\n\\nelaine: so you guys are tryin\\' to work it out! that\\'s great!... \\n\\nnoreen: yeah, well... we\\'re trying... but he just went insane there for a while... \\n\\nelaine: oh, he went insane?... \\n\\nnoreen: believe it or not, paul was convinced i was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! what kind of a sick person calls and hangs up over and over? \\n\\nelaine: (awkward, increasingly avoiding eye contact) well. uh. i don\\'t know about sick. i mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn\\'t wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit-chat, an\\' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn\\'t want to speak to them, ah! \\n\\nnoreen: (has been growing increasingly slackjawed in amazement) i can\\'t believe that was you... \\n\\nelaine: (looks at noreen) i\\'m really sorry, noreen... \\n\\nnoreen: (reconsidering paul\\'s worth) ...so you thought he was boring? \\n\\nelaine: hey, noreen, don\\'t go by me! ha ha. \\n\\njerry: what are you doin\\' to this woman?! this is the second relationship you\\'ve ruined for her in a few weeks!! \\n\\nelaine: (head in arms) i know-- \\n\\njerry: first you ruin her relationship with the high talker. \\n\\nelaine: well... i got confused, they sound exactly the same. \\n\\njerry: so she breaks up with him. somehow picks up the pieces of her life. miraculously meets... a new guy! ya bust that up! an\\' then, just as they\\'re reconciling, you announce to the world he\\'s boring. \\n\\nelaine: (apologetically) i didn\\'t know she\\'d take it so seriously. \\n\\njerry: well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman anything you say she does! \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\ndonna: it\\'s donna chang. \\n\\njerry: (hits button) come on up. (opens door a little) \\n\\nelaine: well, i guess i just didn\\'t realize it... \\n\\njerry: well, let\\'s look back at your history with this woman. okay? \\n\\nelaine: (like a little girl) okay... \\n\\njerry: first, you encouraged her to join the army... she did. \\n\\nelaine: she was lost... \\n\\njerry: then, you suggest she goes... awol! she did! \\n\\nelaine: well, she didn\\'t seem to be havin\\' so much fun... \\n\\njerry: you know... you better make sure and never tell this woman to jump off the brooklyn bridge... \\n\\nelaine: if i have this much influence over her, why don\\'t i just call her an\\' tell her to get back together with him--that\\'s aalll! \\n\\ndonna: hi. \\n\\njerry: oh, miss changstein! this is elaine... \\n\\n(at the same time--donna: helllo...--elaine hi! how are you?) \\n\\ndonna: (to jerry) guess what? mrs. costanza called me, they\\'re not getting divorced. \\n\\nelaine: (happy gasp) oh. \\n\\njerry: why? what happened? \\n\\ndonna: well, she was trying to call george last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour and she changed her mind!!! \\n\\njerry: wow! that\\'s amazing! \\n\\ndonna: anyway, she wants to meet me! she invited me over for dinner! \\n\\nelaine: (off camera) huh. \\n\\ndonna: she said you should come too. \\n\\njerry: tonight? \\n\\ndonna: yeah--i just remembered, i\\'m gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. (goes to phone) \\n\\ngeorge: all right. (tearing his jacket off) let me just say one thing there is no way that this is gonna happen. you hear me? no way! because if you think i\\'m going\\' to two thanksgivings, you\\'re out of your mind!!! \\n\\nestelle: (calmly) we\\'re not getting divorced. \\n\\nfrank: your mother changed her mind... (tries to catch a fly with his hand) \\n\\ngeorge: (gleeful, to estelle) you did?! that\\'s goood! that\\'s very good! i\\'m very glad to hear that. \\n\\nfrank: yeah, we worked it out. \\n\\ngeorge: all right. so let me ask you a question. who was the man in the cape? \\n\\nfrank: he was my lawyer. \\n\\ngeorge: your lawyer wears a cape...? \\n\\nfrank: yeah. so what? \\n\\ngeorge: who wears a cape? \\n\\nfrank: he\\'s very independent; he doesn\\'t follow the trends. \\n\\nestelle: he looks ridiculous in that thing... \\n\\nfrank: (shouting) you have no eye for fashion!!! \\n\\nestelle: (shouting) i have no eye for fashion?!?!?! \\n\\ngeorge: all right! come on! let\\'s not fight. \\n\\nfrank and estelle: all right! all right! \\n\\nestelle: georgie\\'s right. (pats him on the cheek) \\n\\ngeorge: (quietly) ehh. (pausing to look at both of them) so what made you change your mind? \\n\\nestelle: it was that chinese woman. \\n\\njerry: so i\\'m curious. what\\'d you tell mrs. costanza that changed her mind? \\n\\ndonna: i mentioned a few bits of wisdom from confucius. \\n\\njerry: confucius, huh? \\n\\ndonna: yeah. \\n\\njerry: (pause) you know, you\\'re not chinese... \\n\\njerry: hey! i heard the good news! \\n\\nfrank: jerry, how come you didn\\'t say hello to me the other day, huh?! \\n\\njerry: elaine was... in a rush. \\n\\nfrank: (to george, pointing) i knew it was elaine!! \\n\\ndonna: you must be estelle. \\n\\nestelle: (giggles) yes. who are you...? \\n\\ndonna: i\\'m donna chang! \\n\\nestelle: (steps back, appalled) you\\'re not chinese! \\n\\nkramer: y\\'ello? \\n\\nelaine: paul? \\n\\nkramer: elaine! \\n\\nelaine: kramer? \\n\\nkramer: (pause) yeahh! \\n\\nelaine: what are you doin\\' there? \\n\\nkramer: wellll, isn\\'t it obvious? \\n\\nelaine: (scoffs) uh, is noreen there? \\n\\nkramer: yes she is... \\n\\nelaine: (pause) well... can i talk to her? \\n\\nkramer: oh, what? am i... tooo boring for you? \\n\\nelaine: (losing patience) alright--would you just put her on? \\n\\nkramer: well, i feel that it would be best that you didn\\'t talk to noreen for a while... \\n\\nelaine: you feel? \\n\\nkramer: that\\'s right! she an\\' i have had a very long talk. an\\' i was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you\\'ve had over her life, lo these many years... \\n\\nelaine: what, are you insane?! \\n\\nkramer: from now on, i\\'ll be calling the shots around here... \\n\\nelaine: uh! ho-ho. an\\' what are you gonna tell her? \\n\\nkramer: well. i\\'ve encouraged her to go back into the army...(noreen sighs a little) there she\\'ll get the structure an\\' the discipline she needs right now... and she\\'ll have qualified officers telling her what to do... \\n\\nelaine: (sighs) kramer! you have got to let me talk to her! \\n\\nkramer: can\\'t help ya, kid. \\n\\nelaine: get the-- (kramer puts phone down) \\n\\nestelle: you\\'re not chinese!?!? \\n\\ndonna: ...no. \\n\\nestelle: i thought you were chinese!! \\n\\ndonna: i\\'m from long island. \\n\\nestelle: long island?!?! i thought i was gettin\\' advice from a chinese woman!! \\n\\ndonna: i\\'m sorry...? \\n\\nestelle: well... then... that changes everything! \\n\\ngeorge: what?! \\n\\nestelle: she\\'s not chinese; i was duped!! \\n\\ngeorge: so what?! she still gave you advice; what\\'s the difference if she\\'s not chinese?!?! \\n\\nestelle: i\\'m not taking advice from some girl from long island!! (goes into another room) \\n\\ngeorge: (chases after her) wait a minute! you\\'re--now you\\'re getting a divorce because she\\'s from long island?!?! \\n\\nfrank: (shouts after them) you want a divorce?!!? you got one!!! \\n\\njerry: (pause, to donna) you know, you might wanna think about changin\\' your name... \\n\\nelaine: so, ever since she started dating kramer, she won\\'t even talk to me! \\n\\njerry: well--noreen listened to you like george\\'s mother listened to the chinese. (buys a newspaper out of a machine) \\n\\nelaine: (pause) you know, everybody listens to the chinese. i mean, look at the fortune cookie. you couldn\\'t get away with that in any other restaurant. \\n\\nelaine: (quietly) hu_uh, (pause) you know, everybody listens to the chinese. i mean, look at the fortune cookie. you couldn\\'t get away with that in any other restaurant. \\n\\njerry: yeah, no one\\'s reading any rolled-up messages in a knish... \\n\\ngeorge: oh, it had to happen!! \\n\\njerry: hey. \\n\\ngeorge: i knew it!! (shuts cab door) i predicted it! (hits cab roof twice, it drives off) saw both of them today! what a disaster! i\\'m runnin\\' all over queens. first i saw my mother. we had lunch together. never had... lunch with my mother before--it\\'s like a date! then we drive down to kew gardens! tons of traffic! i see my father. we played \"clue\"! all day with this! [kew gardens (see links at end of script)] \\n\\nkramer: (triumphant) hey, jerry! guess what! the kramer name might live on! noreen\\'s late! she\\'s laaate!! (give two thumbs up) \\n\\nnoreen: (surprised) who are you?! \\n\\nman: i\\'m frank costanza\\'s lawyer. (he starts pulling her to safety) \\n\\njerry: so, she got you to join a book club? \\n\\ngeorge: i got a feeling i\\'m gonna be much smarter than you pretty soon. \\n\\njerry: well, i think that statement alone reflects your burgeoning intelligence. (sits on a couch.) hey, what about this one? \\n\\ngeorge: nah, i don\\'t like that one. \\n\\njerry: so, what\\'s your first book? \\n\\ngeorge: \"breakfast at tiffany\\'s.\" 90 pages. (waves a hand like it\\'s nothing.) \\n\\njerry: it\\'s kinda old, isn\\'t it? \\n\\ngeorge: they wanted to read a truman capote book. \\n\\njerry (standing): oh, sure...truman capote. \\n\\ngeorge: he\\'s a great writer. \\n\\njerry: oh, yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: did you ever read anything by him? \\n\\njerry: no. you? \\n\\ngeorge: nah. \\n\\njerry (sees a white couch by the wall): oh, what about this one? look at this, this is it! this is what i\\'m looking for. (sits on the couch.) oh, yeah! \\n\\nelaine: hey, what\\'s going on? \\n\\njerry: new couch, baby! \\n\\nelaine: new couch? why? \\n\\njerry: i love this couch. you know what the best part about it is? it doesn\\'t fold out, so no one can sleep over. \\n\\nelaine (to carl, flirtatiously): hello. \\n\\ncarl: hello. \\n\\nelaine: oh, let me get the door for you. (they carry the couch out the door.) ooh, be careful! \\n\\njerry: wait till you see it, it\\'s perfect. the guy told me it\\'s one of a kind, they stopped making it. \\n\\nelaine: what are you doing with your old couch? \\n\\njerry: nothing, the moving guys are taking it. why, you want it? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, i\\'ll take it. \\n\\njerry: well, i\\'m sure that they can deliver it to your apartment. \\n\\nelaine: yes, they can. (kramer enters.) \\n\\nkramer: hey! couch is comin.\\' \\n\\njerry: it\\'s here! \\n\\nkramer: alright! yeah. you know, i\\'m excited about this, jerry. in a way, i feel like i\\'m getting a new couch. \\n\\njerry (nonplussed): yeah. so do i. \\n\\nkramer: ooh! remember poppie? \\n\\njerry: oh, you mean from poppie\\'s restaurant? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, yeah. anyway, uh...we\\'re going into business together. remember that idea i had a few years ago about the pizza place where you make your own pizza? \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\nelaine: what was that again? \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s a pizza place where you make your own pie! we give you the dough, the sauce, the cheese...you pound it, slap it, you flip it up into the air...you put your toppings on and you slide it into the oven! sounds good, huh? \\n\\nelaine (in a southern accent): ooh, i can\\'t wait to get me a fella and make mah own pie! \\n\\njerry: what made you resurrect that old idea? \\n\\nkramer: well, i happened to be eating at poppie\\'s when i told him the \"old\" idea, and his eyes - waaaaaah! - just lit up. you know, he wants to back it. \\n\\nelaine: i heard poppie\\'s was good, let\\'s go. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m not goin\\' there. didn\\'t he get busted by the board of health? \\n\\nkramer: that was in the past, jerry. as it happens, new york magazine just judged his kitchen to be one of the cleanest in the city. they got a duck there, you think you died and went to heaven. \\n\\nelaine: ooh! i love duck. c\\'mon, c\\'mon! \\n\\nkramer: yeah, but you gotta order it two days in advance. (to jerry) you know, i\\'m gonna call him, i\\'m gonna order the duck for you. \\n\\njerry: oh, kramer, i - \\n\\njerry: right there, guys. that\\'s perfect. ah? whatta ya think, lainie? \\n\\nelaine: well, i don\\'t know. i\\'ll have to sit on it. \\n\\njerry: oh no, i don\\'t want anyone sitting on it. \\n\\ncarl (hands jerry an invoice): sign here. \\n\\nelaine (to carl): excuse me, i was wondering if would it be possible if you could deliver the old couch to my apartment? it\\'s not very far. \\n\\ncarl: sure. \\n\\nelaine: \\'kay. you, uh...you got room in the truck for me? \\n\\ncarl: yeah, i think we can squeeze you in. \\n\\nelaine: oh, goody. okay, well uh...(to jerry and kramer)...i\\'ll see you chumps later. (elaine and carl exit.) \\n\\nkramer: did you offer those guys a drink? \\n\\njerry: uh, no. should i have? \\n\\nkramer: what kind of a person are you? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know. \\n\\ngeorge: okay. \"breakfast at tiffany\\'s.\" (begins to read, but gradually his attention is drawn to the tv guide on the end table. george realizes there\\'s a show on he wants to see by looking at his watch, and doesn\\'t start the book.) \\n\\nelaine: so, he puts the couch down, and just as he\\'s about to leave he says, \"do you date moving men?\" \\n\\njerry: ah ha... \\n\\nelaine: you wanna know what i said? \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t wait. \\n\\nelaine: \"i do now.\" \\n\\njerry: clever. \\n\\nelaine: is that something? \\n\\njerry: yes. \\n\\nelaine: is that something? \\n\\njerry: you\\'re something. so anyway, when they were in my house before, i didn\\'t offer them anything to drink. \\n\\nelaine: well, they\\'re real men, jerry. they get sweaty. \\n\\njerry: so, anyone sweaty comes into your house has to be offered a drink? \\n\\nelaine: yes. \\n\\njerry: well, would you apologize for me? (elaine nods. poppie comes out of the kitchen.) \\n\\npoppie: hello! jerry, so good to see you again! (puts his hand out.) \\n\\njerry (clearly creeped out by having to shake poppie\\'s hand): hello, poppie. this is elaine. \\n\\nelaine: nice to meet you, poppie. \\n\\npoppie: let me show you to your table. (leads jerry and elaine to the table.) your duck is cooking as we speak. it is so succulent...so succulent! \\n\\njerry: well, kramer told us all about your business venture together. \\n\\npoppie: your friend and i are going to make a lot of money. of course, i already have a lot of money. poppie does very well...very well. \\n\\nelaine: well, your mother must be very proud of you. \\n\\npoppie: my mother...was taken from my house by the communists in the middle of the night when i was ten years old. she was sent to a slave labor camp, where she labored for twelve years. finally, they released her and she was on a boat to america to re-unite with us...but she was served some bad fish, and she died...on the high seas. \\n\\njerry: so, what\\'s good tonight? \\n\\nelaine: boy, i\\'m really looking forward to this duck. i\\'ve never had food ordered in advance before. \\n\\njerry: ah, i could\\'ve stayed home and ordered a pizza from paccino\\'s. \\n\\nelaine: paccino\\'s? oh no. you should never order pizza from paccino\\'s. \\n\\njerry: why not? \\n\\nelaine: because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, anti-abortion groups. \\n\\njerry: so, you won\\'t eat the pizza? \\n\\nelaine: no way. \\n\\njerry: really. \\n\\nelaine: yeah. \\n\\njerry: well, what if poppie felt the same way? \\n\\nelaine: well, i guess i wouldn\\'t eat here, then. \\n\\njerry: really! \\n\\nelaine: yeah. that\\'s right. \\n\\njerry: well, perhaps we should inquire. poppie! oh, poppie. could i have a word? (poppie comes over.) \\n\\npoppie: yes, jerry. i just checked your duck...it is more succulent than even i had hoped. \\n\\njerry: poppie, i was just curious...where do you stand on the abortion issue? \\n\\npoppie: when my mother was abducted by the communists, she was with child... \\n\\njerry: oh, boy. \\n\\npoppie: ...but the communists, they put an end to that! so, on this issue there is no debate! and no intelligent person can think differently. \\n\\nelaine (offended): well...poppie. i think differently. \\n\\npoppie: and what gives you the right to do that? \\n\\nelaine (standing up): the supreme court gives me the right to do that! let\\'s go jerry, c\\'mon. \\n\\nwoman at next table (to her date): i heard that. let\\'s go, henry. \\n\\nhenry: but we just got here... \\n\\nwoman at another table: i\\'m with you, poppie! \\n\\nwoman at yet another table (to her date): let\\'s go! \\n\\nelaine (to poppie): and i am not coming back! \\n\\npoppie: you\\'re not welcome! \\n\\njerry: well, i\\'m certainly glad i brought it up. (gets up and leaves.) \\n\\njerry: well, you should have seen it. it was quite a scene over there. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m sorry i missed it. \\n\\njerry: oh, you really missed something. and i have to say...it was pretty much all my fault. (jerry smiles. george laughs.) so, how\\'s the book coming? (george\\'s laughs taper off...) i say, how\\'s the book comin\\'? \\n\\ngeorge: oh...pretty good. \\n\\njerry: so, what\\'s it about? \\n\\ngeorge: well, it\\'s about holly go-lightly. \\n\\njerry: holly go-lightly. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, she\\'s quite a character. \\n\\njerry: yes, you haven\\'t read a page, have you? \\n\\ngeorge: no. \\n\\njerry: big surprise. \\n\\ngeorge: i couldn\\'t. you know, if it\\'s not about sports, i find it very hard to concentrate. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re not very bright, are you? \\n\\ngeorge: no, i\\'m not. i would like to be, but i\\'m not. what am i gonna do? the book club meets in a few days. \\n\\njerry: why don\\'t you rent the movie? \\n\\ngeorge: \\'why don\\'t i rent the movie.\\' see, this is when i like you. alright, now i\\'m relieved. (kramer enters and comes over to the booth.) \\n\\nkramer (scanning a menu): so...how was the dinner last night? \\n\\njerry: oh...well... \\n\\nkramer: did you enjoy the duck? (elaine comes back from the bathroom.) oh, elaine! i was just asking how dinner went last night. \\n\\nelaine (sitting down): oh...well... \\n\\nkramer: alright, what did you do to poppie? \\n\\nelaine: nothing. \\n\\nkramer: well, he\\'s in the hospital. and the cook says you put him there. \\n\\nelaine: what\\'s wrong with him? \\n\\nkramer: i don\\'t know! i\\'m gonna go and visit him later. (angrily) it would be nice if you got him something. (punches the the table to accentuate this, and leaves.) \\n\\njerry: we should get him something. \\n\\nelaine: yeah. you\\'re right. \\n\\nelaine: do you know that i have been using the same bottle of shampoo for a year? and i shampoo every day. (carl smiles.) so, what do you think of my conversation? \\n\\ncarl: not much! (they both laugh.) i, uh, would have invited you up, but i don\\'t have any furniture. \\n\\nelaine: you don\\'t have any furniture? \\n\\ncarl: no, i hate furniture. i can\\'t look at it. (they laugh again.) \\n\\nelaine: well, i can understand that. pretty good date, huh? \\n\\ncarl: yeah! no heavy lifting. (elaine and carl look into each others eyes, then kiss.) \\n\\nkramer: anyway, jerry and elaine felt very badly about what happened to you, and they wanted you to have this. \\n\\npoppie (opening the gift basket): what\\'s this? a bottle of wine and a five-alarm chili? they\\'re trying to kill poppie?! \\n\\nkramer: why, what...? \\n\\npoppie: don\\'t they know i have a gastro-intestinal disorder? if i would have any of this, i would die. then poppie\\'s no good to anyone! this is a sick, sick joke on poppie. how could you be friends with those two? \\n\\nkramer: well, we\\'re not very close. \\n\\npoppie: they owe me for those ducks. they were flown in from newfoundland. \\n\\nkramer: oh, they got good ducks there, huh? \\n\\npoppie: oh, very good ducks. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m in looove! \\n\\njerry: whoa! \\n\\nelaine: this is it, jerry! this is it! he is such an incredible person! he\\'s real, he\\'s honest, he\\'s unpretentious...oh, i\\'m really lucky! \\n\\njerry: did you tell him i was sorry i didn\\'t offer him the drink? \\n\\nelaine: no, i forgot. and, the best part is, he doesn\\'t play games. you know? there are no games! (sits down on the couch.) \\n\\njerry: no games? what is the point of dating without games? how do you know if you\\'re winning or losing? \\n\\nelaine (putting on lipstick): well, all i know is, he doesn\\'t like games and he doesn\\'t play games, you know? he has too much character and integrity. \\n\\njerry: ah ha. and what is his stand on abortion? \\n\\nelaine (looks at jerry and smears lipstick across her face): what? \\n\\njerry: what is his stand...on abortion? \\n\\nelaine: well, i\\'m sure he\\'s pro-choice. \\n\\njerry: how do you know? \\n\\nelaine: because he, well...he\\'s just so good-looking. \\n\\njerry: well, you should probably ask, because if he\\'s gonna be coming over with those paccino\\'s pizzas...could be trouble. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'d like to rent breakfast at tiffany\\'s. \\n\\nclerk (checking the computer): uh, this is out. someone has it. \\n\\ngeorge: out? oh no, i\\'ve been to four other places, you\\'re the only ones that have had it. \\n\\nclerk: well, i could put it on reserve for you, if you\\'d like. \\n\\ngeorge: maybe we could call them and ask them to return it. \\n\\nclerk: oh, sorry. we can\\'t do that. \\n\\ngeorge: well, maybe they\\'re done with it. i could go pick it up. \\n\\nclerk: i don\\'t think so. it doesn\\'t work that way. \\n\\nvoice on intercom: yes? \\n\\ngeorge: uh, excuse me, are you joe temple? \\n\\nintercom: yes. \\n\\ngeorge: uh, yes, uh...you don\\'t know me, my name is george costanza...did you happen to rent breakfast at tiffany\\'s? \\n\\nkramer: hey. \\n\\njerry: hey, what\\'s happenin.\\' \\n\\nkramer: well, you know, poppie\\'s over at my place. tonight\\'s the big night. i\\'m gonna make the first test pizza at the restaurant. \\n\\njerry: you got a regular \\'manhattan project\\' going on over there. \\n\\nkramer: yeah. anyway, he\\'s about to leave, he wants the duck money. (poppie enters.) \\n\\njerry: okay. hi, poppie. \\n\\npoppie: hello. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m sorry about the gift, i didn\\'t know about your condition. \\n\\npoppie: that\\'s fine. if you just give me my duck money, i\\'ll be on my way. \\n\\njerry: okay. i\\'ll get it. (goes into the bedroom.) \\n\\nkramer: why don\\'t you sit down, poppie? you\\'re still recuperating. (poppie moves to the sofa and sits down, and exhales a loud sigh of relief.) what, are you tired, poppie? \\n\\npoppie: no. \\n\\nkramer: hey, poppie...you really think people wanna make their own pizza? \\n\\npoppie: kramer, did i ever tell you about my mother? my mother - \\n\\njerry (comes out of the bedroom with poppie\\'s money): here you go. (poppie stands up and takes the money.) anyway, i\\'m sorry again about the...(notices a large, wet stain on his couch)...the...the... \\n\\npoppie: the what?

(grabs kramer.) poppie peed on my sofa!! \\n\\nkramer: are you sure? \\n\\njerry: well, what is it then?! my new sofa! poppie peed on my new sofa! \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m sure it\\'ll come out. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t care if it comes out, i can\\'t sit on that anymore! \\n\\nkramer: ah, you\\'re making too much of it. \\n\\njerry (sarcastic): yeah, you\\'re right. it\\'s just a natural human function...happens to be on my sofa, instead of in the toilet, where it would normally be. \\n\\nkramer: right! \\n\\ngeorge: well, anyway, the book club meets tomorrow, mr. temple. \\n\\njoe: well, i was going to watch it with my daughter. she likes audrey hepburn very much. \\n\\ngeorge: she was a delicate flower. \\n\\njoe: why didn\\'t you just read the book? \\n\\ngeorge: well, as i say, the pink-eye made my vision...quite blurry... (joe\\'s daughter comes to the door.) \\n\\njoe: remy, this is george. would you mind if he watched breakfast at tiffany\\'s with us? (george smiles at remy. remy looks at joe doubtfully.) \\n\\ncarl: hi. \\n\\nelaine: hi. (they kiss.) \\n\\ncarl: i missed you. \\n\\nelaine: oh, i missed you! \\n\\ncarl: i don\\'t remember the last time i felt this way. \\n\\nelaine: me, either! \\n\\ncarl: i think about you all the time. \\n\\nelaine: you do? \\n\\ncarl: do you think about me? \\n\\nelaine: oh yeah, all the time, all the time...although, recently i\\'ve been thinking about this friend of mine. \\n\\ncarl: what friend? \\n\\nelaine: oh, just this woman...she got impregnated by her troglodytic half-brother, and decided to have an abortion. (waits in suspense for what carl\\'s response will be.) \\n\\ncarl: you know, someday...we\\'re going to get enough people in the supreme court to change that law. \\n\\ngeorge: so, anything to uh, nosh? \\n\\njoe: what did you want? \\n\\ngeorge: popcorn? \\n\\nremy: popcorn? where do you think you are? \\n\\ngeorge: well, a lot of people keep popcorn in the house. \\n\\nremy: well, we don\\'t. \\n\\ngeorge: you might want to try it...makes the movie more enjoyable, that\\'s all. \\n\\njoe (passes george a bowl): here\\'s some nuts. \\n\\ngeorge: oh! nuts! excellent! you know what i love? how there\\'s two nuts named after people. hazel...and filbert. \\n\\nremy (to joe): can we watch the movie now, daddy? (joe presses play on the remote.) \\n\\ngeorge: hey, let\\'s turn off the lights, get some real \\'movie atmosphere.\\' \\n\\njoe: the lights are fine. (george shrugs, and the movie begins.) \\n\\nkramer (in a chef\\'s hat and apron): see, anybody can do this. (tosses pizza dough into the air.) \\n\\npoppie: use your wrist! it\\'s all in the wrist. (kramer tosses the dough way up there.) not too high! \\n\\nkramer (puts the dough on the counter): alright, put a little sauce on here... (speaks some unintelligible words in an italian accent while spreading the sauce around.) some cheese... \\n\\npoppie: not too much! \\n\\nkramer: and...cucumbers! (grabs a large handful and puts them on the pizza.) \\n\\npoppie: wait a second...what is that? \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s cucumbers. \\n\\npoppie: no, no. you can\\'t put cucumbers on a pizza. \\n\\nkramer: well, why not? i like cucumbers. \\n\\npoppie: that\\'s not a pizza. it\\'ll taste terrible. \\n\\nkramer: but that\\'s the idea, you make your own pie. \\n\\npoppie: yes, but we cannot give the people the right to choose any topping they want! now on this issue there can be no debate! \\n\\nkramer: what gives you the right to tell me how i would make my pie? \\n\\npoppie: because it\\'s a pizza! \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s not a pizza until it comes out of the oven! \\n\\npoppie: it\\'s a pizza the moment you put your fists in the dough! \\n\\nkramer: no, it isn\\'t! \\n\\npoppie: yes, it is! \\n\\njoe\\'s wife: i\\'m home. \\n\\njoe: hey, honey. \\n\\nremy: hi, mom. \\n\\njoe\\'s wife: hi, baby.

(pauses the tape with the remote.) \\n\\ngeorge: any more grape juice? (gets up and goes to the kitchen. remy moves to the end of the couch where george was sitting.) \\n\\njoe\\'s wife: who is this guy? \\n\\nremy: he\\'s in some book club. \\n\\njoe\\'s wife: and what\\'s he doing here? \\n\\nremy: cheating on his test. (george returns from the kitchen with a glass of grape juice.) \\n\\ngeorge: so, we watching the movie, or are we still talking? (joe\\'s wife shakes her head and goes into the other room. george gestures to remy to move.) okay, c\\'mon. let\\'s go. \\n\\nremy: what? \\n\\ngeorge: c\\'mon, you took my seat. \\n\\nremy: it\\'s not your seat. \\n\\ngeorge: i was sitting there, c\\'mon. \\n\\nremy: you didn\\'t save it. \\n\\ngeorge: i had the arm! joe... \\n\\njoe: what\\'s the difference? \\n\\ngeorge: well, i was very comfortable! i\\'ve got my nuts here... \\n\\nremy: it\\'s my couch. \\n\\ngeorge: alright, c\\'mon, scooch over. (tries to squeeze into the corner seat of the couch and struggles with remy. he spills his glass of grape juice all over the couch in the process.) \\n\\nremy: look! look what you did! you got grape juice all over our couch, you\\'ve ruined our couch! (joe slowly walks toward george with his hands on his hips.) \\n\\ngeorge: joe... \\n\\nelaine: oh my god. \\n\\njerry: you see?! \\n\\nelaine: so, you\\'re gonna get a new couch? \\n\\njerry: well, i guess i have no choice. \\n\\nelaine: do you want your old couch back? \\n\\njerry: i was hoping you\\'d offer. (the intercom buzzes, jerry answers it.) yeah? \\n\\nintercom: it\\'s the movers. \\n\\njerry: \\'kay. (buzzes them in.) \\n\\nelaine: who\\'s that? \\n\\njerry: your boyfriend, he\\'s taking it out. \\n\\nelaine: no, no, he\\'s not my boyfriend. \\n\\njerry: why? \\n\\nelaine: take a guess. \\n\\njerry: oh, really. (carl and another moving guy come in and pick up the couch.) \\n\\nelaine: hi. \\n\\ncarl: hi. \\n\\njerry: hey carl, i also need you to go to elaine\\'s and bring my old couch back. \\n\\ncarl: today? \\n\\njerry: could you? \\n\\ncarl: sure. \\n\\nelaine (to jerry): what are you doing with this couch? \\n\\njerry: george is taking it. \\n\\nelaine: did you tell him it was peed on? \\n\\njerry: he said he doesn\\'t care, he\\'ll just turn the cushion over. \\n\\ncarl: i\\'m sorry you feel that way, elaine. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, me too. \\n\\ncarl: it\\'s just too bad. \\n\\nelaine: yeah. it is. \\n\\ncarl: well, i better get this couch back to jerry\\'s. \\n\\nelaine: can i offer you anything to drink? \\n\\ncarl (off-camera): yeah, sure. \\n\\nelaine (looking in the fridge): all i\\'ve got is grape juice. \\n\\ncarl: throw it! \\n\\ncarl: the couch! \\n\\nmarie (describing holly go-lightly in \"breakfast at tiffany\\'s\"): she didn\\'t want the constraints of any relationship, that\\'s why she got rid of the cat. the most important thing in holly\\'s life was her independence. \\n\\ngeorge: well, not really. after all, she did get together with george peppard. i mean, fred. \\n\\nmarie: george...fred\\'s gay. \\n\\njerry: i\\'ve never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre toilet seats that they have. you know, like those clear lucite ones, with all the, the coins in it? it\\'s a lovely tribute to our past president, by the way. it\\'s not bad enough lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta pull down our pants and sit on him, too. it\\'s just incomprehensible that you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and this says what about you? \"well, i can\\'t afford to just throw money down the toilet, but look how close i am!\" \\n\\njerry: i cannot believe lindsay\\'s still seeing you after that \"breakfast at tiffany\\'s\" thing. \\n\\ngeorge: i think she finds my stupidity charming. \\n\\njerry: as we all do. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, anyway, she\\'s uh, having some kind of a family lunch, i\\'ll swing by after. \\n\\njerry: oh, so you\\'re gonna meet the mother? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, i\\'ll zip in, \"how do you do?\", zip out. she\\'ll love me. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re good with the mothers. \\n\\ngeorge: y\\'know, i\\'m better with the mothers than i am with the daughters. \\n\\njerry: maybe you should date the mothers. \\n\\ngeorge: well, if i could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, then i\\'d really have something goin\\'. \\n\\njerry: oh, you got something goin\\'. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. \\n\\nkramer: (enters apartment) hey. \\n\\ngeorge: hey!

(inserts tape into vcr, sets up tv) \\n\\njerry: kramer, are you still on this? i\\'ve seen gymnasts. i know what they do. it\\'s not going to make any difference. \\n\\nkramer: jerry, what is your problem? \\n\\njerry: kramer, y\\'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don\\'t know what it\\'s like for guys like me. i\\'m in the unfortunate position of having to consider people\\'s feelings. \\n\\nkramer: all right, jerry--are you familiar with the kama sutra? \\n\\njerry: no. \\n\\nkramer: tantric yoga? \\n\\njerry: no. \\n\\nkramer: jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual delights that most men dare not dream of! \\n\\njerry: boy, you can really talk some trash. (to george) i guess that\\'s better than eating it. \\n\\nkramer: all right, all right, why don\\'t we just watch the tape? (starts playback) \\n\\njerry: all right. \\n\\ngeorge: did you pass your stone yet? \\n\\nkramer: not yet. but the suspense is killing me. \\n\\njerry: (pointing at tv) hey, that\\'s her! \\n\\nkramer: oh yeah. oh yeah, that\\'s her.

(gets up to leave as george and jerry continue to watch, mouths agape) perhaps you\\'d like to keep the tape? (silence) well, i\\'ll take that as a yes. \\n\\njerry: (smiling and excited) well, here we are. \\n\\nkatya: yes. we are here. \\n\\njerry: how did you stay on that beam like that? (holds up hand) i mean, it\\'s only this wide! \\n\\nkatya: i can balance myself in any position. \\n\\nkatya: it is amazing after years of training how one can contort one\\'s body. of course, it is only useful in gymnastics. \\n\\njerry: oh boy... \\n\\njerry: i couldn\\'t believe it. uh, i mean i thought i was entering a \"magical world\" of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. i mean, there was nothing gymnastic about it. \\n\\nelaine: well, what did you think she was gonna do? \\n\\njerry: well, you know. i mean... i dunno. \\n\\nelaine: no, what? \\n\\njerry: well, obviously i prefer not to mention any, you know... \\n\\nelaine: what did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk and... \\n\\njerry: you see, now i really don\\'t want to get into this, any kind of specifics... \\n\\nelaine: oh, come on. one thing? one thing! what? \\n\\njerry: well... frankly, i thought, you know, i was gonna kinda\\' be like the apparatus. \\n\\nkramer: you mean like the uneven parallel bars? \\n\\njerry: see, again, i really don\\'t feel that... \\n\\nelaine: the balance beam? \\n\\njerry: could we stop? \\n\\nelaine: (gasps in mock surprise) not the pommel horse? \\n\\njerry: all right. let\\'s just drop it. \\n\\njerry: so lemme ask you this how long would you say i have to put in now because of, you know, last night. \\n\\nelaine: i dunno, at least three weeks. \\n\\njerry: (sarcastic) oh, great. \\n\\nelaine: jerry, that is such small potatoes. i think that i may have single-handedly put the kibosh on the big water merger. \\n\\njerry: between poland and morgan? \\n\\nelaine: yeah. started a big name controversy. \\n\\njerry: kramer! the stone! \\n\\njerry: what happened, did you pass the stone? \\n\\nkramer: (off-screen) no, i tried to do a reverse hecht off my couch and i didn\\'t make it. \\n\\ngeorge: (singing as he exits florist with bouquet and a cup of coffee) \"...tootsie, good-bye. too-too, tootsie...\" (takes a drink, makes a face, shouts back at shop) you call this coffee? (dumps out coffee behind him, accidentally hitting a parked car\\'s windshield) \\n\\nman in car: hey! what the hell was that?! \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m sorry! i\\'m terribly sorry! i- i- \\n\\nman in car: clean that up! \\n\\ngeorge: oh, sure. of course. (looks for place to set down flowers) um, uh, could you hold these? for just a second, just a second. (grabs newspapers from trash bin, begins wiping windshield) here you go, now don\\'t worry about a thing. it\\'s gonna be fine. here we go. look at this shine. \\n\\nmrs. enright: (sees george cleaning car windshield, looks appalled) \\n\\ngeorge: look at this sparkle.

(jerry nodding) ... oh, you think because of what i said about the manure. i wa, wa, was just saying how it takes a negative thing, and puts it on a positive spin on it. \\n\\njerry: im just saying there\\'s a chance she may not have been enamored with your thoughts and feelings on manure. \\n\\ngeorge: so you don\\'t think she really has a boyfriend? \\n\\njerry: my honest opinion, i think she made it up. \\n\\ngeorge: well then she\\'s just a liar, isn\\'t she? \\n\\nkramer: hey. \\n\\njerry: aaa. well ... you want something to eat, don\\'t you? \\n\\nkramer: ahh, no, no, no. you got me all wrong buddy. i am loving this no refrigerator. you know what i discovered? i really like depriving myself of things. it\\'s fun. very monastic. \\n\\ngeorge: well what do you eat? \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s all fresh. fresh fish, fresh foul, fresh fruit. i buy it, i omniga nominga, i eat it. \\n\\njerry: well im glad it\\'s working out. \\n\\nkramer: oh yeah, it\\'s working out. and i got a date with that waitress who works at reggies. \\n\\njerry: boy, if i could meet a hostess, we could open up our own place. \\n\\nkramer: ha ha ha ha. yeah, well, ill tell you, she\\'s a full-figured gal. \\n\\njerry: is she? \\n\\nkramer: oh you better believe it buddy. hey george, we could double sometime. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, yeah, yeah we could. you know, ah, kramer, the next time you talk to her, find out if she knows kelly, from monk\\'s. i wanna know if she really has a boyfriend. \\n\\nkramer: all right it\\'s done. \\n\\njerry: hello? \\n\\nbania: hi, jerry. it\\'s kenny. \\n\\njerry: oh, hi. \\n\\nbania: you know, i was thinking if you\\'re not busy, maybe i can get my meal today? \\n\\njerry: yeah, you wanna get that meal, don\\'t you? \\n\\nbania: how about mendys, ooh, ever been there? \\n\\njerry: no i haven\\'t? \\n\\nbania: ah youre gonna love it. ill meet you there around 700. \\n\\njerry: all right. \\n\\nbania: ahh. \\n\\njerry: (hangs up the phone) yeah, i really needed that suit. \\n\\nbania: i start off with curls. that\\'s good for the bicep.

(nodding his head up and down) \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s not for me. it\\'s for hilde -- the waitress i was telling you about. she\\'s hungry, she wants food. if i go back in there without any food ... there\\'s gonna be trouble. (his voice gets really high pitched on his last sentence) \\n\\njerry: all right, go ahead \\n\\nkramer: thanks buddy. (goes over to the fridge and pulls out a few things) \\n\\nhilde: did you find anything! \\n\\nkramer: uh, yeah, ah ... \\n\\nkramer: there\\'s a few things in here, ah, peanut butter, cheese, yeah ... \\n\\nhilde: cheese is good. yeah, what kind? \\n\\nkramer: uh, swiss. \\n\\nhilde: all right, it\\'ll have to do. come on. \\n\\njerry: what are we doing out here? aren\\'t we going to go in and eat? \\n\\ngeorge: i can\\'t go in there. im too uncomfortable. \\n\\njerry: oh, w-what are you saying? so we\\'re not going to go in there anymore? \\n\\nelaine: hey, what are you doing out here? \\n\\njerry: we can\\'t eat here anymore, because he took a waitress out for a walk. \\n\\ngeorge: what\\'s the difference? let\\'s go to reggies. \\n\\nelaine: reggies? i can\\'t eat anything there. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s the same menu. \\n\\nelaine: there\\'s no big salad. \\n\\ngeorge: they\\'ll make you a big salad. what do you think, they\\'re the only one\\'s that make a big salad? \\n\\nelaine: all right. let\\'s go, to reggies. \\n\\njerry: so what\\'s going on with simon? did he leave? \\n\\nelaine: ahh ... wait till you hear this. \\n\\nelaine: so simon picks this woman up, right in front of me. \\n\\njerry: look at this. they make a point of saying on the menu, no egg white omelets. look at that. \\n\\ngeorge: so what! have a yoke! it won\\'t kill you. \\n\\nhilde: (walks up to the table) hello. \\n\\njerry: oh, hi hilde. can i get an egg white omelet? \\n\\nhilde: did you read the menu? \\n\\njerry: all right, just give me a western.

(turns and walks away) \\n\\nelaine: ah (hu ha - small laugh) \\n\\nbania: hey jerry, where\\'s my suit? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t have it. you want half my omelet? (holds his omelet plate up to bania) \\n\\nmonk\\'s manager: (on the phone, we assume it\\'s george calling) i told you, she\\'s busy. she can\\'t come to the phone now! (hangs up) \\n\\nmonk\\'s manager: you better tell your boyfriend to stop calling here. \\n\\nkelly: oh he\\'s not my boyfriend. it\\'s that bald guy with the glasses, who\\'s always here with them. he\\'s trying to get me in trouble. \\n\\nmonk\\'s manager: hey! yeah. i got a message for you. you tell your friend george, that the next time i see him around here, im going to turn him into my own, personal, hand-puppet. \\n\\nsimon: well, hello. here you are as promised. you see, im a man of my word. (drops keys into elaine\\'s extended palm) \\n\\nelaine: when are you leaving? \\n\\nsimon: elaine, are you trying to get rid of me? aha ha ha ha ha ha ha. i was supposed to leave tomorrow, but all of a sudden, i\\'ve been set up with a job interview that might enable me to extend my visit indefinitely. and it is all due, to this suit. how do i look? im a shoe-in aren\\'t i. thanks again love. (touches the table, turns and walks to the exit) \\n\\nelaine: (turns towards the lunch counter) hey kenny. you still want to get that suit back? \\n\\nbania: (leans backwards from the counter) yeah! \\n\\nelaine: there it goes. (pointing at simon walking out the door) \\n\\nbania: hey! hey! (he runs out the door after simon; from outside) come here you! \\n\\nsimon: (from outside monk\\'s) what are you doing? unhand me! \\n\\nbania: (from outside monk\\'s) take it off! \\n\\ncar salesman: george, are you sure i can\\'t show you any other cars? \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t think so, vic. i\\'ve done my homework. \\'89 volvo, that\\'s the car for me, it\\'s the one i want. \\n\\nsalesman: i got a lebaron convertible right here. \\n\\ngeorge (chuckles): n.i. not interested. \\n\\nsalesman: it\\'s got a few more miles on it, but the previous owner was john voight. \\n\\ngeorge (suddenly interested): jon voight? \\n\\njerry: okay, tim. you\\'re welcome. (hangs up.) \\n\\nelaine: was that tim whatley? \\n\\njerry: yes, it was. he wanted your address - you, my friend, are going to be invited to his night-before-thanksgiving party. (elaine raises her hands triumphantly, then gleefully struts her way to the kitchen.) you know, he\\'s got that great apartment on 77th street, and they overlook where they inflate all those huge balloons for the macy\\'s thankgiving day parade? \\n\\nelaine: i have always had a big crush on tim whatley. why can\\'t he ask me out? (punctuates this by shoving jerry.) \\n\\njerry: oh, he\\'s a dentist. you don\\'t want to go out with a dentist. \\n\\nelaine: why? \\n\\njerry: he\\'ll always be criticizing your brushing technique, it\\'ll drive you crazy. (mimics brushing his teeth) away from the gums... (the door opens a little, george jangles the keys to his new car at jerry and elaine, then enters.) \\n\\njerry: uh - new car! \\n\\nelaine: ohhh! \\n\\njerry: hey! did you get the volvo? \\n\\ngeorge: no, i decided to go with an \\'89 lebaron. \\n\\nelaine: a lebaron? \\n\\njerry: i thought consumer said volvo was the car. \\n\\ngeorge: what consumer? i\\'m the consumer. \\n\\njerry: alright. seems like...a strange choice. \\n\\ngeorge: well, maybe so...but it was good enough for mr. jon voight. \\n\\nelaine: jon voight? the actor? \\n\\ngeorge (boasting): that\\'s right. he just happened to be the previous owner of the vehicle. \\n\\njerry: you bought a car because it belonged to jon voight? \\n\\ngeorge (defensive): no, no... \\n\\njerry: i think yes, yes. you like the idea of telling people you\\'re driving jon voight\\'s car. \\n\\ngeorge: alright, maybe i do. so what. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'ve never even seen him in a car. i mean, look at his movies. no cars. deliverance - canoe. midnight cowboy - boots. runaway train...runaway train. (kramer enters.) \\n\\nkramer: hey. \\n\\njerry: hey. \\n\\nkramer: jerry, you know that shoe repair place at the end of the block? well, if they don\\'t get some business, they\\'re gonna have to shut down and make way for one of those gourmet coffee or cookie stores. \\n\\nelaine: i like coffee. \\n\\ngeorge: i like (imitates kramer) \"cookies.\" \\n\\nkramer: yeah, of course you do. and do you know why? because you\\'re a bunch of yuppies. it\\'s your go-go corporate takeover lifestyles that are driving out these mom and pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighborhood. \\n\\ngeorge: well, what\\'s so great about a mom and pop store? let me tell you something. if my mom and pop ran a store, i wouldn\\'t shop there. \\n\\nkramer: hey, bogambo - they\\'ve been in the neighborhood for 48 years. now, come on, jerry. you\\'ve gotta have a pair of shoes in need of a cobblin.\\' \\n\\njerry: i really don\\'t wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled. \\n\\nkramer: well, what about sneakers? you know, they\\'ll clean \\'em. they do complete detailing. \\n\\njerry: alright, take \\'em. \\n\\nkramer (happily): yeah-yah. \\n\\npop: kramer, without you, we\\'d be out of business. \\n\\nkramer: well you know, these sneakers, they belong to my neighbor, jerry seinfeld? the comedian. \\n\\nmom: so many sneakers! \\n\\nkramer: well, he\\'s got a peter pan complex. \\n\\npop: they\\'ll be ready a week from thursday. \\n\\nkramer: oh, well, no rush. (wipes his nose) uh oh. \\n\\nmom: what\\'s the matter? \\n\\nkramer: oh, i keep getting these nosebleeds. \\n\\nmom: oh, lie down, and put your head back. \\n\\nkramer: yeah. (lies on the couch and cracks the back of his head against the armrest.) hey, what\\'s with your ceiling? (mom and pop look up.) \\n\\npop: what? \\n\\nkramer (stuffing tissue up his nose): well, you got wires sticking out every which way. that looks dangerous, you should call the electrician. \\n\\npop: you know, in the 48 years we\\'ve been here, i don\\'t think we\\'ve ever called an electrician. \\n\\nkramer: yeah well, you should. this place could blow any minute. \\n\\nmr. pitt: elaine? \\n\\nelaine: yes, mr. pitt? \\n\\nmr. pitt: have you gotten all the salt off those pretzels yet? \\n\\nelaine: no, i\\'m still working on it. \\n\\nmr. pitt: what in blazes are you listening to? \\n\\nelaine: artie shaw. \"honeysuckle jump.\" (the song ends.) \\n\\ndj on radio: that was artie shaw, \"honeysuckle jump.\" \\n\\nmr. pitt: elaine! how did you know that? \\n\\nelaine: oh, my father used have a huge collection of big band records. \\n\\ndj on radio: congratulations to our listener wayne hopper for identifying it. and by doing so, he becomes our seventh person to land the wfbb-sponsored woody woodpecker balloon in the macy\\'s thanksgiving day parade. (mr. pitt hears this and is intrigued; mouths the words \"woody woodpecker.\") there are only three spots left. we\\'re going to take a little break now; when we come back, you\\'ll have three more chances to win a spot holding a rope under woody woodpecker. \\n\\nmr. pitt (to elaine, excited): could you identify the next song? could you? could you? \\n\\nelaine: mr. pitt, why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the woody woodpecker balloon? \\n\\nmr. pitt: my father was a stern man. he forbad us to participate in any activities that he thought were associated with the common man. the thanksgiving day parade was first on the list. \\n\\nelaine: oh. alright, i\\'ll do the best i can. (turns up the radio.) \\n\\ndj on radio: alright, here we go for the next spot under the balloon. if you know the name of this song, call 555-band. (the music starts. elaine listens intently.) \\n\\nmr. pitt (impatiently): well, elaine? do you know it? what song is it? \\n\\nelaine: will you shut up? i can\\'t hear! \\n\\nmr. pitt: i\\'m sorry! \\n\\nelaine: oh! i\\'ve got it! it\\'s \"next stop pottersville\"! (grabs the phone to call it in.) \\n\\nmr. pitt (overjoyed): goody! yes! yes! yes! (dances back and forth, elated) next stop pottersville, next stop pottersville! you are a genius! \\n\\ngeorge: you are gonna love this car. even if you don\\'t like jon voight. \\n\\njerry: i like jon voight. just seems like kind\\'ve a strange reason to buy a car, because he might have driven it. \\n\\ngeorge: what do you mean \"might\"? you don\\'t think he really owned this car? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know. \\n\\ngeorge: well, why would the guy make up something like that? of all the names he could pick, why settle on jon voight? \\n\\njerry: don\\'t you see, that\\'s the genius of it. if he had said liam neeson, you\\'d know he\\'s making it up. \\n\\ngeorge: neeson? how are you comparing liam neeson with jon voight? jerry, we\\'re talking about joe buck. if you can play joe buck, oskar schindler\\'s a cake walk. (opens the car door for jerry, jerry\\'s about to get in.) \\n\\njerry: oh, look at this, i stepped in gum. \\n\\ngeorge: whoa, whoa, you\\'re not getting in my car with gummy shoes. \\n\\njerry (shuts the car door): alright, i\\'ll change my shoes. (heads back to his apartment. george follows.) \\n\\ngeorge (unimpressed): liam neeson. you know, he\\'s not american. \\n\\njerry: let me get a clean pair. (goes into his room. george strides over to the window.) \\n\\ngeorge (singing): everybody\\'s talkin\\' at me...i can\\'t hear a word they\\'re sayin\\'...just drivin\\' around in jon voight\\'s car... \\n\\njerry (yelling from his room): kramer! (we hear kramer\\'s door slam open and shut. kramer enters. jerry comes out of his room.) hey! where\\'s all my sneakers? \\n\\nkramer: you said take \\'em. \\n\\njerry: not all of \\'em! \\n\\nkramer: well, obviously there was a miscommunication. \\n\\njerry: obviously. so what am i supposed to wear? \\n\\nkramer: jerry, i left you a pair right here...(goes into jerry\\'s room and comes out with a pair of cowboy boots.) c\\'mon. there, put on those boots. \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t wear these! \\n\\nkramer: well, why not? \\n\\njerry: they\\'re uncomfortable. \\n\\nkramer: c\\'mon here, try \\'em on. (jerry sits down and puts the boots on.) \\n\\ngeorge: where did you get those? \\n\\njerry: i worked a club in dallas one time and they couldn\\'t afford to pay me so they gave me these. oh, i can\\'t wear these! (stands up.) they look ridiculous! \\n\\nkramer: ah, you look like a cowboy! huh? \\n\\njerry: but i don\\'t wanna be a cowboy! \\n\\nkramer: oh, stop it. you know that friend of yours, tim the dentist? i got an invitation to his thanksgiving eve party. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, i got one too. \\n\\nkramer: yeah? \\n\\njerry: oh yeah? huh. \\n\\ngeorge: what? \\n\\njerry: no, nothing. \\n\\ngeorge: no, what is it? \\n\\njerry: no, it\\'s just that i, uh...didn\\'t get one. \\n\\ngeorge: you didn\\'t get one? \\n\\njerry: ah, but he called me up and he asked for yours and elaine\\'s addresses, i\\'m sure that means i\\'m invited. \\n\\nkramer: not necessarily. \\n\\njerry: hey, why would you call someone up and ask them for two addresses if you\\'re not invited to the party? \\n\\ngeorge (mocking jerry): that\\'s the genius of it. \\n\\njerry (picks up the phone): i\\'m callin\\' elaine. see if she can find out anything from tim whatley. \\n\\ngeorge (to kramer): hey. i got jon voight\\'s lebaron. (jingles the keys.) \\n\\nkramer (impressed): boss! \\n\\npop: four thousand dollars? we can\\'t afford that! \\n\\nelectrician: well i\\'m afraid you\\'re gonna have to do something about it, because it\\'s in violation of the building code. otherwise, they\\'re gonna close you up. \\n\\npop: but what if we can\\'t pay for it? \\n\\nelectrician: then i have to report you. otherwise, i lose my license. sorry. (exits.) \\n\\npop: 48 years, mom! and now we have to close! all because of that idiot and his bloody nose! (kramer enters.) \\n\\nkramer: afternoon, mom! afternoon, pop. you know you got a crack in the sidewalk out there? now, you oughta get that fixed. \\n\\ngeorge: so? \\n\\njerry: c\\'mon, put the top up, it\\'s november! \\n\\ngeorge: i feel alive, jerry. \\n\\njerry: let\\'s check out the glove box. (opens the glove compartment, takes out a pencil.) ah. pencil. \\n\\ngeorge: hey...you don\\'t think...sure, that\\'s jon voight\\'s pencil! \\n\\njerry: with jon voight\\'s teeth marks. (looks at the owner\\'s manual.) owner\\'s manual...you know what? this car was owned by jon voight. \\n\\ngeorge: ah! see? i told ya. \\n\\njerry: except jon is spelled with an h. j-o-h-n. \\n\\ngeorge: so? \\n\\njerry: doesn\\'t jon voight spell his name j-o-n? \\n\\ngeorge (pulls over): so, what are you saying? \\n\\njerry: nothing. i\\'m sure \"jon\" probably mispelled his own name. i know sometimes i spell jerry with a g...and an i! (laughs uproariously.) \\n\\ngeorge (angrily): get out of the car! \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s right, you heard me. get out! you are ruining this whole experience for me! \\n\\njerry (sarcastically): oh, look! there\\'s gregory peck\\'s bicycle! \\n\\ngeorge: get out! \\n\\njerry: and barbara mandrell\\'s skateboard! \\n\\ngeorge: get out!! (jerry gets out and george drives away. a couple of guys notice jerry in his cowboy boots.) \\n\\ntough guy (threatingly): hey, cowboy. where\\'s your horse? (jerry slips and slides in his cowboy boots and runs away.) yeah, you better run! \\n\\ngeorge: did they take anything? \\n\\njerry: no, they didn\\'t even touch me. i tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots. \\n\\ngeorge: anyway, again, i\\'m sorry about throwing you out of the car. \\n\\njerry: you really seemed to enjoy it. \\n\\ngeorge: it was kinda fun. (elaine gives jerry a cold cloth for his jaw.) you know, maybe his name really is j-o-h-n, but he changed it to j-o-n for show business. well, you know, j-o-n is a lot zippier. \\n\\njerry (sarcastic): yeah, that\\'s possible. \\n\\ngeorge: how would you find out something like that...wait a minute, what am i thinking? i\\'ve got the entire yankee organization at my disposal. \\n\\njerry (to elaine): he\\'ll dispose of it. \\n\\ngeorge: heh, that\\'s right. see ya later. (exits.) \\n\\nelaine: so jerome, i did a little snooping around for you. \\n\\njerry: ah! what\\'d you find out, lois? \\n\\nelaine: well, i talked to tim whatley... \\n\\njerry: yeah... \\n\\nelaine: and i asked him, \"should jerry bring anything?\" \\n\\njerry: so...? \\n\\nelaine: mmmm...and he said, \"why would jerry bring anything?\" \\n\\njerry: alright, but let me ask you this question. \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\njerry: which word did he emphasize? did he say, \"why would jerry bring anything?\" or, \"why would jerry bring anything?\" you emphasize \"jerry\" or \"bring.\" \\n\\nelaine: i think he emphasized \"would.\" \\n\\njerry: you know what? the hell with this party, i don\\'t even want to go to begin with. (kramer enters.) \\n\\nkramer: hey. \\n\\njerry: hey, so where\\'s my sneakers? \\n\\nkramer: that\\'s what i wanna know. \\n\\njerry: what do you mean? \\n\\nkramer: well, i saw mom and pop this morning, but when i went by the store on my way home? the place was empty. everything is gone. mom and pop - vrooop - vanished. \\n\\njerry: so all my sneakers are gone? \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m afraid so. and that\\'s just the tip of the iceberg. i\\'ve been asking around - they didn\\'t even have any kids. \\n\\njerry: mom and pop aren\\'t even a mom and pop?! \\n\\nkramer: it was all an act, jerry. they conned us, and they scored, big time. \\n\\nelaine (amused): so. mom and pop\\'s plan was to move into the neighborhood...establish trust...for 48 years. and then, run off with jerry\\'s sneakers. \\n\\nkramer: apparently. \\n\\nelaine: alright, that\\'s enough of this. \\n\\njerry: where ya goin\\'? \\n\\nelaine: i gotta go to the dixieland deli to pick up mr. pitt\\'s security pass for the parade. \\n\\njerry: why does he want to hold a rope underneath woody woodpecker in the thanksgiving day parade? \\n\\nelaine: he finds his laugh \"intoxicating.\" (laughs like woody woodpecker, and exits.) \\n\\nmr. morgan: so george, what kind of promotional events are we talking about? \\n\\ngeorge: well, i think we need more special days at the stadium, you know? like, uh...joe pepitone day. or, uh...jon voight day. \\n\\nmr. morgan: jon voight? the actor? (rubs his eyes wearily.) uh, i make a motion that we have no more of these meetings that have been initiated by george costanza. \\n\\ngeorge: i suppose if i had suggested liam neeson day, you\\'d all be patting me on the back. \\n\\ncontest winner (to elaine): i guessed stan herman\\'s \"boomtown blues.\" what\\'d you guess? \\n\\nelaine: um, it was, uh...\"next stop pottersville.\" (the group is unimpressed.) uh, do you know when they\\'re giving out the passes? \\n\\ncontest winner: after the music. (the band starts playing directly behind elaine. she is deafened by the loudness of the horns.) \\n\\nkramer: oh. oh man. (takes out a kleenex and puts his head back. jon voight comes out of a doorway and hails a cab.) \\n\\nvoight: taxi! (walks right by kramer.) taxi. \\n\\nkramer: hey! jon voight! jon voight! (voight waves at kramer and hurriedly gets in the cab. kramer runs over to the car.) hey, listen, can i ask you something? listen, listen...(leans in the the open back window of the cab. defensively, voight grabs kramer\\'s arm and bites it. kramer screams. the cab speeds off leaving kramer in the street, stunned.) \\n\\njerry: no jon voight day, huh? \\n\\ngeorge: no. now i\\'ll always have this doubt about the car. what, your jaw still hurts? \\n\\njerry: yeah, it\\'s all swollen. i think i may have chipped a tooth when i fell yesterday. \\n\\ngeorge: you should have somebody take a look at that. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m calling dentists all day here, there\\'s nobody working the day before thanksgiving. \\n\\ngeorge: you going to the party? \\n\\njerry: no, i don\\'t know if i\\'m invited. \\n\\ngeorge: well, there\\'s going to be a lot of dentists there. \\n\\njerry: yeah, you\\'re right. \\n\\ngeorge: you don\\'t want to suffer with this all weekend. \\n\\njerry: yeah, i gotta see a dentist, this is killin\\' me. well, i\\'ll take a chance. we\\'ll go together. \\n\\ngeorge: maybe i\\'ll just meet you there. \\n\\njerry: you don\\'t want to go with me? \\n\\ngeorge: jerry, for all i know this guy went out of his way to not invite you. how am i gonna feel if i show up with an uninvited, unwelcome intruder? \\n\\njerry: the way i feel when i go places with you? (kramer enters.) hey, so\\'d you find my sneakers yet? \\n\\nkramer: no. (to george) but i did run into somebody you might be interested in, a mr. jon voight, the actor? \\n\\ngeorge: jon voight! are you kiddin\\' me? did you talk to him? \\n\\nkramer: well, he was a little standoffish. \\n\\ngeorge: what, you didn\\'t ask him about the car? \\n\\nkramer: no, i couldn\\'t, his cab pulled away. but he did, however, make an impression on me. (pulls up his sleeve and shows george his arm.) look. \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nkramer: his tooth marks. he bit me. \\n\\ngeorge: jon voight bit you? \\n\\njerry: well, what is he, a vampire? \\n\\nkramer: no, it\\'s justifiable. he thought i was going for his wallet. \\n\\ngeorge (looking at kramer\\'s arm): he left perfect imprints. \\n\\nkramer: that he did. now, you got that pencil with the bite marks on it? we get a trained eye to match \\'em up, and we\\'ll see whether or not you\\'re driving jon voight\\'s car! \\n\\njerry: oh, please. \\n\\ngeorge: wait a minute, wait, it\\'s not that stupid. \\n\\njerry: no, it\\'s stupid. \\n\\ngeorge: why? why isn\\'t it possible? i mean, they\\'re both bite marks. \\n\\njerry: so you\\'re gonna show up at that party with a chewed-up pencil and kramer\\'s gnarled arm. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s worth a shot. (goes to the door.) \\n\\njerry: so, kramer, you wanna go to the party together? \\n\\nkramer: jerry, look, come on, i\\'m an invited guest. i can\\'t be aiding and abetting some...party-crasher. \\n\\njerry (under his breath, to a man at the party): excuse me, uh...dentist? you a dentist? (the guy shakes his head. jerry moves on to another guy.) dentist? are you a dentist? \\n\\ngeorge: these are the balloons? big deal, all i see is woody woodpecker. \\n\\nkramer: you got a problem with woody woodpecker? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, what is he? some sort of an instigator? \\n\\nkramer: that\\'s right. he\\'s a troublemaker. \\n\\njerry: hey, elaine. did you get my message? \\n\\nelaine: what? i can\\'t hear a word you\\'re saying. i was stuck at the dixieland deli all day. my head is still ringing. where\\'s tim? \\n\\njerry (pointing at the trophy): what is that, the empire state building? \\n\\nelaine: what? i can\\'t hear you. \\n\\njerry: elaine, would you marry me? \\n\\nelaine: i told you, i can\\'t hear a word. \\n\\njerry: alright. forget it. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, tim. \\n\\ntim: hey, george. kramer, how ya doin.\\' (they shake hands.) \\n\\ngeorge: watch the arm! tim, listen, we don\\'t want to bother you, we know you\\'re busy here. \\n\\ntim: no, it\\'s no problem, what is it? \\n\\ngeorge: let me show you something, take a look at this... (another guy at the party interrupts.) \\n\\nguy: alright tim, i\\'m gonna get goin.\\' \\n\\ntim: alright, let me take down your number. (grabs george\\'s pencil, then notices jerry sitting on the couch.) is that jerry seinfeld? \\n\\nkramer: he didn\\'t come with us. (tim walks over to jerry.) \\n\\ngeorge: uh, tim, the pencil... \\n\\ntim: jerry. \\n\\njerry: hey, tim. \\n\\ntim: jerry. i didn\\'t think you\\'d show. \\n\\njerry: did you say, \"jerry, i didn\\'t think you\\'d show\" or, \"jerry, i didn\\'t think you\\'d show\"? (elaine comes over.) \\n\\ntim: elaine! hi! \\n\\nelaine: tim. \\n\\ntim: well. i\\'m really glad you came. \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\ntim: really glad you came. \\n\\nelaine (deaf): uh huh. \\n\\ntim (picks up a bowl of nuts): listen, elaine, i\\'ve been wanting to ask you...would you like to go out with me new years eve? (elaine thinks tim is offering her a nut, and shakes her head no. tim, rejected, walks away.) thanks. \\n\\nelaine (puzzled): what? what? \\n\\ngeorge: let me ask you something. could you tell if teeth marks on someone\\'s arm matched teeth marks on a pencil? \\n\\ndentist: it\\'s possible. \\n\\ngeorge (to kramer): roll up your sleeve. \\n\\ndentist: somebody bit you? \\n\\nkramer: not just someone. jon voight. \\n\\ndentist: jon voight bit you? (george notices tim across the room with the pencil in his mouth.) the pencil! hey, hey! get the pencil out of your mouth, you\\'re destroying jon voight\\'s teeth marks! \\n\\ntim: that\\'s john voight\\'s pencil? \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s right. i got his whole car downstairs. \\n\\ntim: are you the one who bought his lebaron convertible? \\n\\ngeorge (overjoyed to find out): yes! yes, i\\'m the one! hey! so, you know jon voight! \\n\\ntim: yes! yes, i went to dental school with him. \\n\\ngeorge: jon voight, the actor? \\n\\ntim: no. the periodontist. (george snaps the pencil in two.) \\n\\ndentist: can\\'t this wait until monday? come by my office. \\n\\njerry: just a quick peek. i\\'m in agony. \\n\\ndentist: alright. sit down. \\n\\njerry (sits down): it\\'s this one here in the back. (tilts his head back, and knocks elaine\\'s trophy out the window. a loud hissing sound and commotion is heard from the street below. everyone runs to the windows to look.) \\n\\nkramer: oh! you popped woody woodpecker! \\n\\ntim (to jerry): hey, who invited you, anyway? you\\'re a troublemaker! (jerry nervously laughs like woody woodpecker as the breeze from the popped balloon blows in the window.) \\n\\nannouncer on tv: hey, it looks like woody woodpecker is running out of air. in fact, he\\'s collapsing. \\n\\nkramer: those kids look pretty disappointed. \\n\\njerry: especially that big kid up in the front. (mr. pitt is shown on the television, trying to hold up the deflating woody balloon.) how old is he? (the phone rings.) hello? \\n\\nguy on phone: hello, is this jerry seinfeld? \\n\\njerry: yes it is. \\n\\nguy on phone: you don\\'t know me, but a really strange thing happened. i was at a garage sale, and this old couple sold me a used pair of sneakers they claimed belonged to jerry seinfeld, the comedian. \\n\\njerry: can i have the address of that garage sale? okay, thank you very much. (to kramer) i found mom and pop, they\\'re sellin\\' my sneakers! \\n\\nkramer: where are they? \\n\\njerry: parsippany, new jersey. \\n\\nkramer: let\\'s go! \\n\\njerry: my car\\'s in the shop. \\n\\nkramer: well, how are we getting to parsippany? \\n\\nkramer: uh. jerry. these nosebleeds are starting again. \\n\\njerry (wipes kramer\\'s brow): maybe we should get you to a hospital. \\n\\nkramer (a la ratso rizzo in midnight cowboy): hey, i ain\\'t goin\\' to no bellevue! look at me, i\\'m fallin\\' apart here. \\n\\ngeorge: well i am actually going to have a secretary and i get to do the interview. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s incredible. six months ago you were taking messages for your mother. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, and now someone\\'s going to be taking messages for me. \\n\\njerry: from your mother. \\n\\njerry: so this ah, woman you plan on hiring, is she going to be in the spokes model category? \\n\\ngeorge: sure. i could go the tomato route. but eh, i\\'ve given this a lot of thought jerry. all that frustration. ill never get any work done. so im doing a complete 360. im going for total efficiency and ability. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s a 180, george. \\n\\ngeorge: whatever. \\n\\njerry: hi willie. \\n\\nwillie: hey jerry. \\n\\njerry: i got this stuff and ah my mother\\'s fur coat for storage. \\n\\nwillie: what are you doing with it? \\n\\njerry: ah, she keeps it in my apartment for when she comes up from florida. \\n\\ndonna: hi. \\n\\njerry: hi. \\n\\nwillie: hey jerry, you know my wife donna. \\n\\njerry: yeah, that\\'s why i said hi. \\n\\nwillie: hey, nice jacket. (looking over the jacket) \\n\\njerry: thanks. it\\'s hounds-tooth. \\n\\nwillie: whoa, this is a beauty. great cut. it\\'s probably very flattering. \\n\\njerry: oh yes, it really accentuates my bust line. \\n\\napplicant: well, i type about 90 words a minute. im completely well-versed in all ibm and macintosh programs. \\n\\ngeorge: (looking over her resume) well miss coggins you\\'re ah, obviously qualified for the job. you\\'ve all the necessary skills and experience. but you\\'re extremely attractive. you\\'re gorgeous. im looking at you, i can\\'t even remember my name. so ah, im afraid this is not going to work out (he crumples her resume into a ball) thanks for coming in. \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'re luscious. you\\'re ravishing. i would give up red meat just to get a glimpse of you in a bra. im terribly sorry. (both george and the attractive female applicant stand up as george reaches across the desk and shakes her hand for coming in) \\n\\nade: as you can see my references are impeccable. i think id be a real asset here. my only concern is, i do take care of my mother. so will there be any late nights? \\n\\ngeorge: i can\\'t imagine. \\n\\nelaine: ok, so barneys is having this huge sale. i try this dress on -- (holds the garment bag out towards jerry) -- stunning. stunning. i couldn\\'t take my eyes off myself. \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\nelaine: ok, so then i put it on at home. it looks like im carrying twins. \\n\\njerry: so you\\'re saying, store -- hotsy-totsy, home-- hotsy-notsy. \\n\\nelaine: yeah exactly. anyway i\\'ve got to go over there and return it. \\n\\njerry: i thought we were going to the movies? \\n\\nelaine: all right ill try it on again. you tell me what you think. (she turns and goes into the bedroom to change clothes) \\n\\ngeorge: hey hey. \\n\\nelaine: hey george \\n\\ngeorge: hey elaine. (george hangs up his raincoat next to the door) im telling you jerry, having a secretary is incredible. (george claps hands) i don\\'t know why i didnt have one before. \\n\\njerry: because you didnt have a job? \\n\\ngeorge: perhaps. (hehe) i walk in, everything is organized -- messages, appointments. and i can\\'t tell you how proud i am of myself for going with ade. \\n\\njerry: a lesser man would have crumbled. they would have gone for the dish and the sure fire sexual-harassment suit. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s a little ... \\n\\nelaine: all right! (throws arms down) you answered it right there. \\n\\njerry: you got no waist in that thing. \\n\\ngeorge: you arms look like something hanging in a kosher deli. \\n\\nelaine: i said, all right. \\n\\ngeorge: well whad you buy it for? \\n\\nelaine: why did i buy it, because in the mirror, at barneys, i looked fabulous. this woman was just walking by said i looked like demi (the \"i\" sounds like an \"e\") moore in indecent proposal. \\n\\njerry: how fast was she walking? \\n\\ngeorge: demi (the \"i\" sounds like an \"e\")? i thought it was demi? \\n\\njerry: no. i think it\\'s demi. (the \"i\" sounds like an \"e\") \\n\\ngeorge: really? i never heard of a semi (the \"i\" sounds like an \"e\") tractor-trailer. (jerry nods in agreement) \\n\\nelaine: wait a minute (claps hands) wait a minute. i know what\\'s going on here. skinny mirrors! (she pushes george and jerry in their respective chests, with her arms extended -- one arm for each of them -- they recoil with surprise) \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nelaine: skinny mirrors! barneys has skinny mirrors, they make you look, like, 10 pounds lighter. \\n\\njerry: oh, you\\'re crazy. \\n\\nelaine: am i? (hands on hips) do you think i would have bought this dress if i looked like this at barneys? \\n\\ngeorge: (to jerry, as jerry nods in agreement) you know i think she might have something there. \\n\\nkramer: whoa. what are you all dressed up for? \\n\\nelaine: oh im returning this dress to barneys. \\n\\nkramer: good idea. \\n\\njerry: do it tomorrow. well go to the movies. \\n\\nelaine: yeah yeah, ok. \\n\\nkramer: hey look, if you\\'re going there, maybe you could pick me up some of this super hydrating, it\\'s a total-protection moisturizer with uva. \\n\\nelaine: moisturizer? that\\'s girls stuff. \\n\\nkramer: no no, look. ill tell you what -- they\\'re having a sale right. \\n\\nelaine: yeah. \\n\\nkramer: ill meetcha down there, well have lunch. \\n\\nelaine: well we could ... \\n\\nkramer: well, well get to know each other. we never get to spend any time together. oh sure we have our little group here, but ... (he looks and gestures out towards george and jerry, as elaine walks back into the bedroom to change out of the dress -- kramer scratches his head in sort of disbelief) \\n\\ngeorge: and then assuming the strike is resolved, on april 14th, we, ah, play the angels. so lets clear a floor at the anaheim hotel. \\n\\nade: anaheim hotel. (george picks up a container of chinese food from the credenza) you may want to reconsider. i believe they only have room service until 10 p.m. and then it\\'s only finger foods. \\n\\ngeorge: ade, you\\'re a wonder. (he he -- george laughs) \\n\\nade: ok, now i projected some of those figures for you regarding the switch to canola oil for the stadium popcorn and surprisingly it will only come to 1/2 a cent more per bag, so it is definitely doable. \\n\\ngeorge: ade, i have to tell you, i, i have never met anybody so ... efficient. \\n\\nade: well thank you, im flattered. \\n\\ngeorge: i mean you\\'re just, you\\'re just a marvel of organization. \\n\\nade: well im just, hm, doing my job. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s like im thinking of something, and you\\'re (snaps fingers) one step ahead of me. \\n\\nade: what can i say? im ... im good at what i do. (smiling and quietly laughing proudly) \\n\\ngeorge: (coyly, he looks down and runs his finger along the top of the chair back in front of him) do you, uh ... do you know what im ... thinking about now? \\n\\nade: (thinking about the question, she stops writing) yes, i think i do. (she turns her head slowly and looks directly at him) \\n\\ngeorge: is it, uh, doable? \\n\\nade: it\\'s definitely doable. \\n\\njerry: well, that was the worst. \\n\\nelaine: i cant believe they made the wife the killer. (putting on gloves) gimme a break. \\n\\nman: (waiting in line for tickets, he overhears elaine) hey, give us a break. we haven\\'t seen it yet. thanks a lot big mouth! \\n\\nanother man: (waiting in line, closer to the box office) yeah! (in agreement with the other guy) \\n\\nkramer: you got a pen? \\n\\njerry: yeah, i think i do. \\n\\nkramer: and i need something to write on. \\n\\njerry: well, all i got is my dry-cleaning stub. \\n\\nkramer: i gust met uma therman. she\\'s giving me her telephone number. uma jerry, uma. \\n\\njerry: uma therman? really? \\n\\nkramer: yeah. \\n\\nelaine: how\\'d you manage that. \\n\\nkramer: yeah well i don\\'t have any time to talk now. (he rushes back into the theater) \\n\\njerry: he\\'s got the kavorca. (looking towards the theater door, jerry notices one of the movie goers) hey, isn\\'t that willie, my dry-cleaner? \\n\\nelaine: where? \\n\\njerry: he just went in. you know, i think he was wearing my hounds-tooth jacket. \\n\\nelaine: what would he be doing wearing your jacket? \\n\\njerry: it looked just like the jacket i brought in to be dry-cleaned. he complimented me on it. \\n\\nelaine: are you sure? \\n\\nkramer: i got it. uma, uma, uma. (looking at the ticket) \\n\\nelaine: you are amazing. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, all right. taxi\\'s on me. (he walks off camera) \\n\\nade: ah no no no no no. a better way to reach the bra would be to undo the jacket, then go around the back of the shirt. \\n\\ngeorge: ade you are incredible \\n\\nade: oh ...oh ...oh ... here, i want to show you something. hand me that pillow. \\n\\ngeorge: what? oh, my god! \\n\\nade: mr. co stan za! \\n\\ngeorge: ade, ahh, ahh, ah ... im giving you a raise! \\n\\njerry: so you\\'re having sex and then all of a sudden, you just blurt out im giving you a raise. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. \\n\\njerry: just a quick sidebar here -- are you in anyway authorized to give raises? \\n\\ngeorge: not that im aware of, no. \\n\\njerry: so you\\'re so grateful to have sex, that you\\'ll just shout out anything that comes into your head. \\n\\ngeorge: i didnt think ahead. \\n\\njerry: well maybe she\\'ll just think it was bawdy talk. \\n\\ngeorge: i didnt say any other bawdy things. \\n\\njerry: maybe you could have sex with her again and then take it back. \\n\\ngeorge: all right, you know you\\'re not any help at all here. i don\\'t know what even the point is of talking to you anymore. \\n\\njerry: all right, all right. im sorry. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, well, i guess the only thing i can do is go into george steinbrenners office and tell him he has to give her a raise. \\n\\njerry: how long has she been there? \\n\\ngeorge: 3 days. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s almost a week. \\n\\njerry: oh, my god. \\n\\ngeorge: what? \\n\\njerry: it\\'s a movie stub from the 930 show. george, i think willie the dry-cleaner has been wearing my clothes. \\n\\nelaine: these mirrors are skinny mirrors. this is false ... reflecting. and i think, that the department of ... you know, whatever, would be very interested to know what\\'s going on here. \\n\\nbarney\\'s sales associate: well, we\\'re more than happy to exchange it for something else. \\n\\nelaine: ok fine. (smiling) i did like that little calvin klein number right by the elevator. you know the little ... (motions in the direction of the elevator) \\n\\nbarney\\'s sales associate: ill bring it to your dressing room. \\n\\nelaine: ok thanks so much. (the barneys sales associate turns and walks away. elaine turns to kramer as he admires himself in the mirror) what are you all dressed up for? \\n\\nkramer: well elaine, when you\\'re shopping on madison avenue, you don\\'t want to skip on the, swank. \\n\\nelaine: i like your little bag. \\n\\nkramer: huh, oh hey, look at this. (he pulls a little tube out of the bag) it\\'s the super hydrating, triple-action moisturizer, hmm. \\n\\nelaine: huh. \\n\\nkramer: wait till that uma smells this uva. \\n\\nbania: hey kramer. \\n\\nkramer: hey bania, what\\'s happening? (kramer, looking into the mirror, is putting moisturizer under his eyes) \\n\\nbania: im looking for a new suit. i cant find anything i like. that\\'s a nice suit. (admiring kramers suit) \\n\\nkramer: well, thank you. \\n\\nbania: did you get that here? \\n\\nkramer: no, this is vintage. they don\\'t make this stuff anymore. \\n\\nbania: you\\'re telling me. \\n\\nkramer: i sure am. \\n\\nbania: it\\'s hard for me to find pants that -- \\n\\nkramer: (interrupting bania) that don\\'t make you look high-waisted. \\n\\nbania: yes \\n\\nkramer: me too. \\n\\nbania: what size are you? \\n\\nkramer: uh, 42. \\n\\nbania: 42, that\\'s what i am now. i\\'ve been working out, im huge. how\\'d you like to sell it? \\n\\nkramer: make me an offer. \\n\\nbania: 100 bucks \\n\\nkramer: surely you jest. (walks away from bania) \\n\\nbania: 175 \\n\\nkramer: look at the stitching (takes the jacket off to show bania) this is old world craftsmanship. \\n\\nbania: 300 dollars. \\n\\nkramer: sold. follow me into the dressing room. \\n\\nbania: you throw the shirt in? \\n\\nkramer: bania, you\\'re killing me. \\n\\nbania: hey that\\'s the women\\'s dressing room. \\n\\nkramer: there\\'s nothing in there that i haven\\'t seen before. \\n\\ngeorge: (opens the door, looks in and then knocks 5 times) mr. steinbrenner, (waves) can i talk to you for a second? \\n\\nsteinbrenner: yes yes george. can you talk to me for a second? of course you can -- im a very accessible man. i just wanted to say you\\'re doing great work on that canola oil stuff. \\n\\ngeorge: well, you know, to be honest sir -- my, my new secretary ade, came up with that one. \\n\\nsteinbrenner: ade, ade, i like that name george. \\n\\ngeorge: she supports her whole family. (walking slowly into the room) \\n\\nsteinbrenner: is that a fact george? \\n\\ngeorge: yes, in fact, her mother is in the hospital right now. it\\'s some kind of a diverticulitis. (he continues walking slowly towards steinbrenners desk) \\n\\nsteinbrenner: i had a bout of that myself one time -- knocked me right on my ass. \\n\\ngeorge: she cant even afford to go out to lunch. she\\'s been eating in a high school cafeterias she pretends to be a teacher. it\\'s pathetic. \\n\\nsteinbrenner: what\\'s that cost her, like, two and a quarter? ($2.25) \\n\\ngeorge: you know what i was just thinking -- she could really use a raise. \\n\\nsteinbrenner: you know, she\\'d be better off making a sandwich at home and bringing it in. (picks up the telephone hand set) hello, ah, george will you excuse me. \\n\\nkramer: psst. hey. \\n\\nelaine: kramer, what are you doing here? \\n\\nkramer: listen, i need you to get me some clothes. \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, i just sold my suit to bania for a cool three-hundred. \\n\\nelaine: so go buy a new one. \\n\\nkramer: what, at this place? it would destroy my whole profit margin. \\n\\nelaine: so. \\n\\nkramer: listen do me a favor -- just call jerry, tell him to bring me some clothes. \\n\\nelaine: ouhhh (kramer disappears back behind his wall as elaine opens the dressing room door) \\n\\njerry: hello, willie. \\n\\nwillie: hey, jerry. you dropping off? \\n\\njerry: no, but ah, seen any good movies lately? \\n\\nwillie: you came by to ask that? \\n\\njerry: yeah. specifically 930 shows. seen any good 930 shows at the paragon, willie? \\n\\nwillie: what are you gettin at? \\n\\njerry: i saw you the other night stepping out with my hounds-tooth jacket. \\n\\nwillie: jerry that\\'s a breach of the dry-cleaners code. \\n\\njerry: you need a code to tell you not to wear peoples clothes \\n\\nwillie: i wasn\\'t wearing your jacket. jerry you\\'re imagining things. (he makes the circular motion next to his ears - the international symbol for insane) \\n\\njerry: yeahhh, am i imagining this? (he whips out the movie stub and holds it up to willie) found this little cutie in the pocket. (throws the stub on the counter) \\n\\nwillie: jerry. \\n\\njerry: yeah, yeah. well, now that we understand each other -- ill be taking my business elsewhere. and i want my mother\\'s fur coat back too. \\n\\nwillie: jerry, come on. \\n\\njerry: now. \\n\\nwillie: now? (willie looks off with his eyes to his left -- he is thinking about his wife donna) \\n\\njerry: yeah. i want that coat. (jerry opens his wallet, looking for the dry-cleaning ticket) \\n\\nwillie: well ... ahh. (apprehensively) \\n\\njerry: where\\'s that ticket? oh, kramer. \\n\\nwillie: wait, you, you mean to tell me you don\\'t have a ticket for the coat? \\n\\njerry: no, not on me. \\n\\nwillie: well, i, i need to see that ticket. \\n\\njerry: why? i\\'ve got my cleaning before without a ticket. \\n\\nwillie: yeah, but this is different. those fur storage warehouses are huge. you cant, get anything without a number. \\n\\njerry: all right, ill be back. \\n\\nelaine: yeah it looks good here, but what does that mean? \\n\\nbarney\\'s sales associate: so, uh, do you want it? \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t know, i have to think about it. (the sales associate walks away) i need a nonpartisan mirror. \\n\\nade: i cant thank you enough, mr. costanza. im so grateful \\n\\ngeorge: yes, well, i sat down with mr. steinbrenner. i told him you have been doing great work. i said that you deserved a raise, and if you didnt get it, that i, was leaving. (motions with both arms in a circular motion to his right) \\n\\nade: it was just so generous. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, well, don\\'t worry about it -- he\\'s got plenty of money. (spins his chair away from her) \\n\\nade: oh i know, but twenty five thousand. \\n\\ngeorge: (spins his chair back to face her) so you got a $25,000 a year raise. \\n\\nade: yes, i tell you, mr. steinbrenner... \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'re making more than i am. \\n\\nade: i am? \\n\\ngeorge: what are you doing? you\\'re making more than i am. a secretary cannot make more than her boss. \\n\\nade: well apparently they can. \\n\\nelaine: oh, this is insanity. im not this hippie. (meaning her hips are not that large) \\n\\nelaine: hey, what do you think of this? \\n\\nman: (with disbelief) you\\'ll never pull it off. \\n\\nfemale customer: hey, what\\'s going on in there? \\n\\njerry: (to the barneys sales associate) excuse me, could you tell me where i could find, like, women\\'s moisturizer lotions? \\n\\nfemale customer: this woman has been in there for over an hour. \\n\\nbarney\\'s sales associate: excuse me miss., is everything ok in there? \\n\\nkramer: [yeah] (through the door) \\n\\njerry: kramer? \\n\\nkramer: oh, jerry, you got my clothes? \\n\\njerry: what clothes? \\n\\nkramer: didnt elaine call you? \\n\\njerry: no. \\n\\nkramer: well what are you doing here? \\n\\njerry: what am i doing here? you\\'re in the women\\'s dressing room. i need that ticket stub back so i can get my mother\\'s fur coat out. \\n\\nkramer: oh, the stub, yeah. i left it in my, my pants \\n\\njerry: where are your pants? \\n\\nkramer: well, i sold them to bania. \\n\\njerry: what? you sold your pants to bania. let me in. \\n\\njerry: why\\'d you sell your pants to bania? \\n\\nkramer: ouhhh -- i had uma thermans number written on that stub. i lost umas number. \\n\\njerry: where are your clothes? \\n\\nkramer: i told you i sold them to bania. \\n\\njerry: you mean what you were wearing? \\n\\nkramer: yeah. \\n\\njerry: how\\'d you expect to get out of here? \\n\\nkramer: well, i didnt think ahead. \\n\\nelaine: this isn\\'t going to work for me ... so if you could show me something else. \\n\\nbarney\\'s sales associate: no. \\n\\nelaine: no? \\n\\nbarney\\'s sales associate: no, because you\\'re taking that one. \\n\\nelaine: i am? \\n\\nbarney\\'s sales associate: yes. because you wore it out of the store. \\n\\nelaine: ha! that\\'s preposterous. \\n\\nbarney\\'s sales associate: i suppose that salt stain came from all the snow in the store. \\n\\nbarney\\'s sales associate: shall i wrap it or will you wear it out? \\n\\nelaine: no. you can wrap it. (dejected. elaine puts her head down and her hand to her forehead as she walks into the dressing room area) kramer, are you still in there? \\n\\njerry: [elaine] \\n\\nelaine: jerry? \\n\\nbania: elaine, where\\'s kramer? \\n\\nkramer: bania? \\n\\nbania: kramer. \\n\\njerry: im going out. (he comes out of the dressing room, while kramer remains inside) \\n\\nbania: jerry. \\n\\njerry: bania. \\n\\nbania: kramer, i want my money back for this suit. you\\'re nancy-boy cream leaked all over the pockets -- suits ruined. \\n\\nkramer: well you\\'re not getting any money back. (kramer opens the door) jerry, come back in here. \\n\\njerry: (to bania) excuse me. (he goes back in the dressing room) \\n\\nkramer: umas number is on that ticket. \\n\\njerry: never mind uma, i need that ticket to get my mother\\'s fur coat back. why don\\'t you just give him the money for the suit? \\n\\nkramer: im not going to give him $300 now for a suit with moisturizer cream all over it. \\n\\njerry: i got an idea. \\n\\nkramer: what? \\n\\njerry: i cant believe im gonna do this. (jerry opens the door and exits the dressing room. he walks over to bania) \\n\\njerry: bania can i talk to you for a second? how\\'s everything going? \\n\\nbania: pretty good. \\n\\njerry: yeah, well, see the thing of it is, im in a bit of an awkward position here. because, uhh, i don\\'t want to get in between you two guys but ... i need a dry-cleaning ticket that\\'s in the pocket of those pants. \\n\\nbania: well all you gotta do is tell kramer to give me my money back, and you\\'ll get your ticket. \\n\\njerry: yeah, yeah all right, well uh ... tell you what i will do bania -- you give me the ticket, and uh, i will take you out for a nice dinner. \\n\\nbania: can we go back to mendys? \\n\\njerry: you want to go to mendys, ill take you to mendys. \\n\\nbania: twice? i wanna go twice. \\n\\njerry: all right lets be reasonable, bania. im taking you out for a nice dinner. all i want is a little ticket in that pocket. i think it\\'s a pretty good deal. \\n\\nbania: two mendys. \\n\\njerry: . . . all right (gritting teeth) just give me the ticket. \\n\\nbania: here you go. \\n\\njerry: ohh ... (takes the ticket and heads for the dressing room) \\n\\ngeorge: but mr. steinbrenner, how can i be expected to perform my job properly, knowing that my uh, subordinate is making more money than i am? with all due respect sir, it\\'s outta whack. \\n\\nsteinbrenner: uh huh, i understand what you\\'re saying george and i know what it\\'s like to be financially strapped. when i was a young man in cleveland i use to hitchhike to work. one time i got picked up by a bakery truck. you think that stuff smells good? try being cooped up in the back of one of those babies. \\n\\nsteinbrenner: i couldn\\'t look at a donut for the next two years. well not that i was ever one for the sweets. \\n\\nsteinbrenner: sure i like a cup cake every now and then, like everybody else. you know i like it when they have a little cream on the inside, it\\'s a surprise. that\\'s good, plus the chocolate ones are good too. sometimes i just cant even make up my mind. a lot of times ill mix the two together, make a vanilla fudge. \\n\\njerry: let me in, it\\'s me.

(george sighs, exits.) \\n\\ngeorge: i-i-i-i-i got it!!!!! \\n\\ngeorge: all right. let\\'s go over it again, one more time. \\n\\njerry: all right. so i tell sandy that i want to have a mnage  trois with her and her roommate. \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s right. \\n\\njerry: and you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged effect. firstly, the very mention of the idea will cause sandy to recoil in disgust, whereupon she will insist that i remove myself from the premises. \\n\\ngeorge: keep going. \\n\\njerry: at this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events. \\n\\ngeorge: continue. \\n\\njerry: the roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as part of her cannot help but feel somewhat flattered by her inclusion in the unusual request. \\n\\ngeorge: a few days go by and a call is placed at a time when sandy is known to be busy at work. once the initial awkwardness is relieved with a little playful humor, which she [laura] of course cannot resist, an invitation to a friendly dinner is proffered. \\n\\njerry: huh. well, it all sounds pretty good. there\\'s only one flaw in it they\\'re roommates. she\\'d have to go out with me behind sandy\\'s back. she\\'s not gonna do that. \\n\\ngeorge: you disappoint me, my friend. sandy wants nothing to do with you. she tells laura, \"if you want to waste your time with that pervert, that\\'s your problem.\" \\n\\njerry: it\\'s a perfect plan. so inspired. so devious. yet so simple. \\n\\ngeorge: (george, finger in the peanut butter jar) this is what i do. \\n\\nkeith: can i help you? \\n\\nelaine: uh, no, i\\'m ok. \\n\\nkeith: well then what are you doing with that racquet? \\n\\nelaine: um, it\\'s mine. miss. landis borrowed it. \\n\\nkeith: well, i\\'m sorry you can\\'t take that, no no no.. \\n\\nelaine: no no no, i can. i can. it\\'s mine. it\\'s my racquet. \\n\\nkeith: look sweetheart i don\\'t know who you are. i don\\'t know what you\\'re doing here. but... \\n\\nelaine: all right. i\\'m going i\\'m going \\n\\nkeith: not with ... \\n\\nelaine: give it give it .. \\n\\nkeith: leave ... \\n\\nelaine: all right all right forget it. you don\\'t have to mention any of this to miss. landis do you? \\n\\nkeith: i don\\'t have to but i will. \\n\\nclotworthy: morning cosmo \\n\\nkramer: hi mr. clotworthy \\n\\nclotworthy: how are you today? \\n\\nkramer: ah couldn\\'t be better. hi lorraine. \\n\\nlandis: hi cosmo \\n\\nkramer: my mom babs. \\n\\nlandis: hi mrs. kramer \\n\\nbabs: lorraine \\n\\nkramer: yes, it\\'s a fine day \\n\\nvoice: (larry david\\'s voice) what do you say cosmo?

\\n\\nkramer: you ma, know i\\'ve been thinking. i want you to quit that matron job. \\n\\nbabs: yes, well isn\\'t that just easy for you to say. what the hell do you think i\\'m going to do with myself? \\n\\nkramer: well maybe we could go into business together. if you\\'re clean? \\n\\nbabs: i\\'ve been clean for two years. anyway what would we do together? \\n\\nkramer: i\\'ve got plenty of ideas. \\n\\nbabs: i\\'ve always believed in you cosmo. you know that. so i want you to call that place today and tell then tha you\\'re through. \\n\\nbabs: all right. i\\'ll do it. \\n\\nnina: mmmm mm so good. \\n\\ngeorge: ... so glad. \\n\\nnina: will you excuse me i\\'ve got to freshen up. \\n\\ngeorge: and why shouldn\\'t you? be fresh stay fresh \\n\\nwoman: i\\'ll be back. i\\'m not feeling very well. \\n\\nwaitress: care to see our dessert menu? \\n\\ngeorge: uh, yeah. do you know babs? \\n\\nwaitress: oh, yeah i was sorry to hear she left. \\n\\ngeorge: babs left? \\n\\nwaitress: she quit today. \\n\\ngeorge: ah ha. \\n\\nnina: what are you doing here george? \\n\\ngeorge: i was just wondering what it was you wanted for dessert. \\n\\ngeorge: how \\'ya feelin\\'? \\n\\nbabs: hi newman \\n\\nnewman: hi babs \\n\\nbabs: what are you doin\\' \\n\\nnewman: minding my own business. \\n\\nbabs: you\\'ll never get into trouble that way. \\n\\nnewman: what makes you think i\\'m lookin\\' for trouble? \\n\\nbabs: from what i hear you postmen don\\'t have to look too far. \\n\\nnewman: ha ha ha well you know sometimes it just has a way of finding you. cigarette? \\n\\nbabs: don\\'t mind if i do. \\n\\njerry: hey \\n\\ngeorge: what happened to babs. she never showed up last night. the whole thing blew up in my face. \\n\\njerry: ah, that\\'s a shame. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, what happened with sandy. i forgot all about it. did you call her? \\n\\njerry: yeah, i did. in fact i went over there. \\n\\ngeorge: so what happened? she throw you out? eh? \\n\\njerry: no actually, she took it pretty well. \\n\\ngeorge: so what happened? \\n\\njerry: she\\'s into it. \\n\\ngeorge: into what? \\n\\njerry: the manage. and not only that. she just called me and said she talked to the roommate and the roomate\\'s into the manage too. \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s unbelievable. \\n\\njerry: oh, it\\'s a scene man. \\n\\ngeorge: do you ever just get down on your knees and thank god that you know me and have access to my dementia? \\n\\njerry: what are you talking about? i\\'m not goin\\' to do it. \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'re not goin to do it? what do you mean, you\\'re not goin to do it? \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t. i\\'m not an orgy guy. \\n\\ngeorge: are you crazy? this is like discovering plutonium ... by accident. \\n\\njerry: don\\'t you know what it means to become an orgy guy? it changes everything. i\\'d have to dress different. i\\'d have to act different. i\\'d have to grow a mustache and get all kinds of robes and lotions and i\\'d need a new bedspread and new curtains i\\'d have to get thick carpeting and weirso lighting. i\\'d have to get new friends. i\\'d have to get orgy friends. ... naw, i\\'m not ready for it. \\n\\ngeorge: if only something like that could happen to me. \\n\\njerry: oh, shut up you couldn\\'t do it either. \\n\\ngeorge: i know. \\n\\njerry: hey, what happened?

(leaves) \\n\\ngeorge: eh, there\\'s that woman that never talks to anybody. \\n\\ngary: really? \\n\\ngeorge: every day she comes in, she sits at that table and reads. never talks to anybody. \\n\\ngary: oh, i talked to debby bibelo. she said to say hi. \\n\\ngeorge: (pleasant surprise) really? (admonishing) you know gary, i really have to say, i\\'m a little bit hurt that you didn\\'t decide to confide in me. \\n\\ngary: well frankly, you can\\'t keep a secret. you know, you\\'d get two pair, the whole table knows. \\n\\ngeorge: well i still think it was wrong. \\n\\ngary: right, well i\\'m sorry, all right. i guess i was just thinking of myself. \\n\\ngeorge: (well, obviously) yes. \\n\\nkramer: ...so i called the litterbug a pig, not you. i like policeman. i wanted to be a policeman. \\n\\ncop: yeah? so why didn\\'t you? \\n\\nkramer: scared of being shot. \\n\\ncop: mr kramer, let me tell you a story. in nineteen-seventy-nine i ticketed a brown dodge diplomat for parking in a church zone. that fine was never paid, and since then that scofflaw has piled up more parking tickets than anyone in new york city. for sixteen years i pursued him, only to see him give me the slip time and time again. i never got a clean look at his face, but he\\'s become my \\'white whale\\'. mr kramer, that day was yesterday! but thanks to you, i don\\'t know if i\\'ll ever get that chance again! \\n\\nkramer: i like that eye patch. \\n\\ngeorge: (standing) all right, i\\'m gonna move my car, my meter\\'s up. can\\'t park in this city. \\n\\ngary: (standing) hey, george, listen. you know that company i work for, they own that parking lot around the corner. \\n\\ngeorge: wha, that\\'s a kinney lot? \\n\\ngary: yeah, and there\\'s a space opening up, and i could get it for you. you just have to pay the tax on it. it\\'d be like, fifty a month. \\n\\ngeorge: fifty bucks a month, that\\'s incredible! okay, thanks. \\n\\ngary: all right, i got lunch, all right. \\n\\ngeorge: you still owe me a secret. \\n\\ngary: all right, listen. there is something i haven\\'t told you, all right? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah? \\n\\ngary: yeah, but uhm, you can\\'t tell jerry. \\n\\ngeorge: what do think i tell jerry everything? it\\'s not like he\\'s my wife. \\n\\ngary: okay. well, the thing is, i\\'ve been living a lie. \\n\\ngeorge: just one? i\\'m living like twenty. (chuckles) what\\'s yours? \\n\\ngary: well, i (laughs) i never actually had cancer. (laughs) i\\'ll see you. (leaves) \\n\\nelaine: so he refused to tell you where he got the glasses? \\n\\nkramer: (rising) flat out refused! (walks past jerry, who moves his legs) \\n\\nelaine: yeah, isn\\'t that just like him? (she steps over jerry\\'s legs) you know, he has to be the only one who has \\'em. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, tell me about it, soul sister. (he opens the door to leave) anyway, i told jake that you said hi. \\n\\nelaine: what? (she slams the door shut before kramer can exit) you told jake i said hi? \\n\\nkramer: yeah. \\n\\nelaine: i can\\'t believe you did that! why did you tell him i said hi? i never said hi! (to jerry) when did i say hi? \\n\\njerry: i never heard her say hi. \\n\\nkramer: well, it\\'s uh, common courtesy. \\n\\nelaine: no, no. (stamps foot) kramer, you don\\'t understand. he made the last contact between us. i had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship. if he thinks that i said hi, then i lose the upper hand. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s like a game of tag. \\n\\njerry: where you going? \\n\\nelaine: nowhere. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re going to the book store to see jake jarmel, aren\\'t you? \\n\\nelaine: so what if i do? (heads for the door) \\n\\nkramer: (to the exiting elaine) yeah, well, listen. if you\\'re going there, (following her out the door) maybe you can get him to tell you where he got those glasses. (shouting after her) elaine! \\n\\njerry: hey. how\\'d it go with gary? \\n\\ngeorge: (shifty, avoiding jerry\\'s eyes) fine, fine. (he removes his coat) \\n\\njerry: (suspicious) really? \\n\\ngeorge: (shifty) yeah. \\n\\njerry: you look like something\\'s on your mind. \\n\\ngeorge: no. nothing. fine. (he sits at the table) \\n\\njerry: so, that\\'s your poker face. \\n\\ngeorge: my regular face. \\n\\njerry: no it isn\\'t. i\\'ve seen your regular face. that is not it. \\n\\ngeorge: what are you saying? \\n\\njerry: all right george, c\\'mon, what d\\'you got? (sits opposite george) \\n\\ngeorge: i got nothing. \\n\\njerry: what you got, a pair of bullets? \\n\\ngeorge: what you talking about? \\n\\njerry: two pair? three of a kind? \\n\\ngeorge: will you stop it? \\n\\njerry: oh my god, you got a flush! you\\'re holding a flush! \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t have a flush. \\n\\njerry: a full house? you got a full house? turn \\'em over george, i wanna see \\'em. come on, i\\'m calling! (thumps hand on table) what d\\'you got! \\n\\ngeorge: (broken, shouts) gary fogel never had cancer! \\n\\nelaine: so you see, kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you from me. when in fact it was an unauthorised hi. \\n\\njake: you\\'re saying you didn\\'t say hi. \\n\\nelaine: that\\'s what i\\'m saying. \\n\\njake: so that\\'s what you came down here to tell me? \\n\\nelaine: correct. \\n\\njake: you never said hi? \\n\\nelaine: correct. \\n\\njake: you still like me, don\\'t you? \\n\\nelaine: correct. (catches herself) what\\'s that? \\n\\nman: hey, i have been trying to get this book signed all day. \\n\\nelaine: (takes the book from the guy and signs it herself) how can you say that i still like you, when i didn\\'t even say hi to you? \\n\\njake: elaine, coming down here to say that you didn\\'t say hi is more of a gesture than if you did say hi. \\n\\nelaine: ah, jake... (realises his logic) i, uh... \\n\\ngeorge: the doctors thought he had cancer, but the surgery revealed he never actually had it. \\n\\njerry: so what was wrong with him? \\n\\ngeorge: nothing! \\n\\njerry: so he\\'s been lying to me for two months?! \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s right. \\n\\njerry: what kind of person is this? there\\'s only one other person who might be able to do something like this, and that\\'s you. \\n\\ngeorge: well... \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t even think you could do it. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, i could do it. \\n\\njerry: yeah, i guess you could. \\n\\ngeorge: (snorts) c\\'mon. \\n\\njerry: did you know he was so worried about losing more hair if he had to get chemo treatment, i bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the hair team for men, just to put his mind at ease? \\n\\ngeorge: you did that? \\n\\njerry: yeah. oh, i can\\'t wait to talk to this guy. (moves to pick up phone) \\n\\ngeorge: wait a minute, wait a minute. you can\\'t say anything. (rushes to take phone from jerry) \\n\\njerry: why not? \\n\\ngeorge: (puts down handset) because he\\'ll know i told you. besides, he\\'s giving me a parking spot around the corner for practically nothing. \\n\\njerry: so you\\'re telling me, because you\\'re getting free parking, i gotta pretend this guy had cancer when he didn\\'t? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. \\n\\njerry: well i don\\'t like it. i don\\'t like it one bit! and, i\\'m supposed to see him tomorrow. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, well you have to maintain the same disposition too. you can\\'t start acting any differently. you have to be nice. \\n\\njerry: why didn\\'t he tell me? \\n\\ngeorge: because you were being so nice. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t think i can be that nice. \\n\\ngeorge: (shouts) you be nice! \\n\\njerry: gary? \\n\\ngary: what d\\'you think? check it out. (he tries a number of expressions, turning his head side to side, to show off the hairpiece) \\n\\njerry: is that from my gift certificate? \\n\\ngary: yeah buddy. you really came through for me man. you\\'ve been so nice. (shakes jerry by the hand) \\n\\njerry: (through gritted teeth) yeah, well, i\\'m glad you could take advantage. \\n\\ngary: hey, you know what i\\'m thinking of doing? i\\'m getting rid of all my fillings, \\'cos that mercury\\'s toxic. hey, let me see your fillings. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t think so. \\n\\ngary: oh come on, open up. let me take a look. \\n\\ngeorge (v.o.): you be nice! he\\'s giving me a parking space (echoes) parking space... parking space... \\n\\ngary: (peering in) well, what d\\'you know. hey, lookee there, you\\'re loaded. \\n\\njerry: okay. (shuts mouth) \\n\\ngary: hey, look who\\'s over there. miss cool-toes. check this out, jack! (rises) \\n\\nkramer: (to jerry) hey buddy. \\n\\njerry: hey. look at you. wha... what\\'s this? \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s an eyepatch. \\n\\njerry: you look like a pirate. \\n\\nkramer: i wanna be a pirate. \\n\\njerry: (gesturing) this is gary. \\n\\nkramer: (to gary) how you doing? \\n\\ngary: all right. \\n\\nkramer: well, i tell you there\\'s only one problem. \\n\\njerry: can\\'t see on your right side? \\n\\nkramer: no. it\\'s uh, (swaps patch to the other eye) it\\'s itchy \\n\\ndebby: nice car. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. once belonged to jon voight. \\n\\ndebby: so, what made you just call me out of the blue like that? \\n\\ngeorge: oh, well, uh. gary told me you said hi. \\n\\ndebby: i didn\\'t say hi. \\n\\ngeorge: you didn\\'t? \\n\\ndebby: uh, no. i told him to send you my regards. i didn\\'t say hi. \\n\\ngeorge: regards? \\n\\ndebby: yeah, regards. \\n\\nelaine: anyway, i admit i was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him i didn\\'t say hi, but he didn\\'t have to act so smug. oh, i hate smugness. don\\'t you hate smugness? \\n\\ncabbie: (heavy accent) smugness is not a good quality. \\n\\nelaine: (looking out of window) oh my god. that man over there. i think he\\'s wearing glasses that look just like jake\\'s. pull over, stop the car. (hands money to cabbie as she exits) here, here. i think i got a way of getting back at my ex-boyfriend. \\n\\ncabbie: good. revenge is very good. \\n\\nelaine: (calling down street) \\'scuse me! \\'scuse me. (catches up to guy) excuse me, sir. sir? \\n\\nguy: yes? \\n\\nelaine: uh. ah, if you don\\'t mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses? \\n\\nguy: malaysia. \\n\\nelaine: malaysia? \\n\\nguy: yeah. \\n\\nelaine: uhm, look, i know this\\'ll sound odd, but can i buy them from you? \\n\\nguy: actually, i was gonna buy a new pair. \\n\\nelaine: (positive) oh! (little chuckle) \\n\\nguy: but i, i can barely see without these. \\n\\nelaine: c\\'mon. \\n\\nguy: well, these were expensive. \\n\\nelaine: let\\'s start the bidding. \\n\\ngeorge: so, you didn\\'t think this was a date? \\n\\ndebby: n... no, not really. why, is it... a date? \\n\\ngeorge: i thought it was a date. \\n\\ndebby: no. it\\'s not a date. \\n\\ngeorge: what about the regards? \\n\\ndebby: regards don\\'t mean anything. i mean, it\\'s not like i said hi. hey, the fact is... (sighs) i shouldn\\'t say anything. \\n\\ngeorge: no, tell me. \\n\\ndebby: can you keep a secret? \\n\\ngeorge: me? oh yeah. \\n\\ndebby: (deep breath) i never had feelings for gary until he got sick. but, h... he was so brave and... and gained such a wonderful perspective on life. i... i fell in love with him. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, the guy\\'s got some perspective there. \\n\\njerry: hey, do you know what the whip does? \\n\\nkramer: what whip? \\n\\njerry: the whip. in the senate, in the house. \\n\\nkramer: well, you know in the old days, when the senators didn\\'t vote the way that the party leaders wanted \\'em to... they whipped them. (holds imaginary whip) you better vote the way we want you to, or there\\'s gonna be big trouble. (cracks invisible whip and makes sound effect) \\n\\ngary: she won\\'t talk to anyone, huh? oh no, she won\\'t say a word to anybody. well, she\\'s talking a blue streak now, jack! \\n\\ncop: well, well. the \\'white whale\\'. \\n\\ngeorge: (frustrated) oh, look at this. there\\'s no place to park around here. i don\\'t even know why they sell cars in manhattan. \\n\\ndebby: don\\'t complain, at least you have your health. \\n\\ndebby: george, look out for that man! \\n\\ncop: (to escaping car) hey! hey, get back here! \\n\\nkramer: (looking after fleeing car) newman! the white whale! \\n\\ngeorge: can you believe he sold his glasses on the street? \\n\\njerry: can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig? would you do that? \\n\\ngeorge: no. definitely not. \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m pretty sure i wouldn\\'t. \\n\\njerry: and you know what else? he picked up that woman in the coffee shop. \\n\\ngeorge: the one who always sits by herself? \\n\\njerry: yeah! \\n\\ngeorge: how did he do that? \\n\\njerry: because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee. \\n\\ngeorge: really? and debby told me that she fell in love with him because he has all this perspective! \\n\\njerry: she thinks a guy who lies about a life-threatening illness, so he can get some phony hair has perspective? \\n\\ngeorge: (opening door to leave) he picked her up? \\n\\njerry: walked right over to her table. \\n\\ngeorge: wow. (he runs his fingers through his hair, and then brushes the resulting fallout off his jacket) \\n\\nelaine: jake, jake. take a look. (puts on the frames she bought) aaw, see, you\\'re not the only one who has \\'em. i have them too. \\n\\njake: where did you get those? \\n\\nelaine: malaysia. i was in the area. \\n\\nnewman: (surprised) kramer. \\n\\nkramer: just drive. \\n\\nkramer: all right. now you listen, and you listen good. i know who you are. you\\'re the scofflaw. \\n\\nnewman: (defensive) what\\'re you talking about... \\n\\nkramer: (interrupting) ah, don\\'t play dumb. it\\'s me, cosmo. \\n\\nnewman: all right, so it\\'s me. so what? \\n\\nkramer: you don\\'t think i know how you\\'re feeling, every second of the day? looking over your shoulder to see if someone\\'s coming up from behind. sitting alone at night, knowing they could be closing in. \\n\\nnewman: i can\\'t sleep, i tell you! i can\\'t sleep! \\n\\nkramer: ga, of course you can\\'t, you poor sap! now why didn\\'t you tell me? \\n\\nnewman: i couldn\\'t. i couldn\\'t tell anyone. \\n\\nkramer: so you been living this secret the whole time by yourself? \\n\\nnewman: (sobbing) yes, it\\'s been awful. i wanted to tell somebody. (pleading) help me kramer! help me! \\n\\nkramer: all right, all right, i\\'m gonna help you. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'ll try some on and see how they look. it\\'s just hair. \\n\\njerry: you ever see what that thing looks like in the back? you got your natural little curls on the bottom, and then that big phony mat coming down on top of \\'em. \\n\\ngeorge: well, some of \\'em look good. the ones that look good you don\\'t even know about. \\n\\njerry: what if you get involved with a woman? how\\'re you gonna tell her? \\n\\ngeorge: the way they make \\'em these days, i\\'ll never have to tell her. \\n\\njerry: so you keep it a secret your whole life, then at your funeral the mortician comes out (as mortician) \\'here, mrs costanza, i thought you might want this\\'. (as mrs costanza, horrified) aahh! \\n\\nlippman: it\\'s no secret that it\\'s my dream to have my own publishing house, and if this jake jarmel book does, you know, what i think it\\'s gonna do. if i can get this whole thing off the ground, then , you know, i think i\\'ll have something for you.

(to salesman) i\\'m sorry. \\n\\nsalesman: you have to realise this has not been custom-fitted to his scalp. \\n\\ngeorge: (examining reflection) i really think this looks pretty good. \\n\\njerry: why don\\'t you get a pair of white shoes, move down to miami beach and get the whole thing over with? \\n\\ngeorge: (to salesman) well, maybe you could show me something else. \\n\\nsalesman: as i said, it\\'ll be different once we design something specifically for you. but i don\\'t think your friend here is being very helpful. \\n\\njerry: oh, hey, i\\'m being helpful. i am the only one being helpful! \\n\\nsalesman: (getting annoyed) no, i don\\'t think you\\'re being helpful! i think you\\'re being disruptive, and you make it very difficult for your friend here to improve his life! \\n\\njerry: hey! i\\'m trying to prevent my friend from becoming one of those guys people snicker at behind their back, because they look ridiculous! no offence to you personally! \\n\\nsalesman: (angry) all you people with hair think you\\'re so damn superior! you have no idea what it\\'s like. you ever look down in the bottom of your tub and see a fist fulla hair? how\\'d you like to start your day with that?! (looks ready to punch jerry) \\n\\njerry: all right! take it easy! take it easy. \\n\\ngeorge: (leaps to feet) jerry! \\n\\njerry: i\\'m sorry. \\n\\ngeorge: please.

(becomes indistinct) \\n\\ngary: (indistinct) i\\'m not a hundred percent recovered yet! \\n\\njerry: gimme that thing! \\n\\ngeorge: how\\'s your life? all right? \\n\\nwoman: yeah, not bad at all. \\n\\nlippman: (at lectern) and now, uh, ladies and gentlemen of the press, it is my pleasure to introduce you to mr jake jarmel. (he applauds jake as he vacates the lectern in his favour) \\n\\nreporter: so jake, what\\'s your percentage on this book? \\n\\nlippman: oh, actually i, uh, i have some very interesting information on that. (puts on glasses) you know, uh, this is a co-venture and as... \\n\\njake: (notices glasses) where did you get those? \\n\\nlippman: ... as such, it... \\n\\njake: those glasses, where did you get those glasses? \\n\\nlippman: (confused) where... what? \\n\\njake: (to elaine) is this supposed to be some kind of a joke on me? because it\\'s not very funny.

i have to run to the bathroom. \\n\\nboss\\' wife: so, um, you and robert. \\n\\nelaine: yes indeed. \\n\\nboss: i\\'m surprised. \\n\\nelaine: really. why? \\n\\nboss: no reason. \\n\\nelaine: well believe me this didn\\'t happen overnight. robert\\'s not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if you know what i mean. no sirree bob. sure, i mean in a lot of ways, he\\'s a typical guy, he likes his sports, but he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet, or the pleasure he gets in watching ms. liza minelli belt out a few choice numbers. it\\'s those two halves of his personality that just come together to make him the very special guy that he is. \\n\\nelaine: oh, hi honey. \\n\\nelaine: oh it was such a great night. \\n\\njerry: and did they suspect anything? \\n\\nelaine: no, i was a fantastic beard. i held hands, i called him honey. \\n\\njerry: and we discover yet another talent. posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals. \\n\\nelaine: oh it was such a great night. oh. \\n\\njerry: you said that already. \\n\\nelaine: oh i did?

\\n\\njerry: not conversion. you\\'re thinking conversion? \\n\\nelaine: well it did occur to me. \\n\\njerry: you think you can get him to just change teams? he\\'s not going to suddenly switch sides. forget about it. \\n\\nelaine: why? is it irrevocable? \\n\\njerry: because when you join that team it\\'s not a whim. he likes his team. he\\'s set with that team. \\n\\nelaine: we\\'ve got a good team. \\n\\njerry: yeah, we do. we do have a good team. \\n\\nelaine: why can\\'t he play for us? \\n\\njerry: they\\'re only comfortable with *their* equipment. \\n\\nelaine: we just got along *so* great. \\n\\njerry: of course you did. everyone gets along great when there\\'s no possibility of sex. \\n\\nelaine: no, no, no, i sensed something. i did sense something. i perceived a possibility jerry. \\n\\njerry: you realize you\\'re venturing into uncharted waters. \\n\\nelaine: i realize that. \\n\\njerry: are you that desperate? \\n\\nelaine: yes i am. \\n\\njerry: so are you going to bring your gun?... all right, then it\\'s settled. first date, no weapons... all right i\\'ll see you then... okay, bye. \\n\\njerry: what are you looking for? \\n\\nkramer: tupperware. \\n\\njerry: sorry. i don\\'t have any tupperware. \\n\\nkramer: i knew this was going to happen. i just made a delicious casserole, but now it won\\'t keep because i have no tupperware. \\n\\njerry: what about a plastic bag? \\n\\nkramer: you must be kidding. \\n\\njerry: what is the difference? \\n\\nkramer: the patented burp, jerry. it locks in freshness. \\n\\ngeorge: so i spoke a little to your little friend denise last night. \\n\\nkramer: oh yeah, you talked to her. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah for two hours. she\\'s nuts about you. \\n\\nkramer: yeah well we go way back. \\n\\ngeorge: why didn\\'t anything happen between you two? \\n\\nkramer: who\\'s to say it didn\\'t? \\n\\njerry: so did you describe yourself to her over the phone? \\n\\ngeorge: yes i did. \\n\\njerry: what did you say to her? \\n\\ngeorge: what do you think i said? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know. \\n\\ngeorge: i told her the truth. \\n\\njerry: as you see it? \\n\\ngeorge: yes, as i see it. \\n\\njerry: did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there? \\n\\ngeorge: what hat?

i could spot that bird\\'s nest two blocks away. \\n\\ngeorge: you only think that because you know me. \\n\\njerry: have you noticed people staring at your head? \\n\\ngeorge: i noticed people staring at my head because they like what they see. \\n\\njerry: well i think you should either take it off or tell her about it. \\n\\nkramer: no he\\'s not going to take it off. if he was going to go over there bald, i never would have introduced him. \\n\\ngeorge: look, i guarantee she won\\'t know. \\n\\nkramer: yeah that\\'s it. all right, i\\'m going to go down to the precinct. i\\'m going to have lunch with lou. \\n\\njerry: oh, i\\'ll split a cab with you. \\n\\nkramer: hey i\\'m really sorry about the other day. really sorry. \\n\\nhomeless man: hey that\\'s my coffee! \\n\\njerry: hi sarge. \\n\\ntierney: hi, i\\'m sorry i\\'m late. some of our lineup decoys didn\\'t show. hey any of you guys want to be in the lineup?

\\n\\ngeorge: yeah. hi. it\\'s great to meet you. \\n\\ndenise: likewise. have you been waiting long? \\n\\ngeorge: no, no. i just got here. a few minutes ago. \\n\\ndenise: good, good. \\n\\ngeorge: well why don\\'t you take off your hat and stay awhile. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s that? \\n\\ntierney: a polygraph. it\\'s what you civilians call a lie detector test. \\n\\njerry: oh. let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that their pants are actually on fire? \\n\\ntierney: if i could tell you the famous faces that have been up here. a certain cast member of melrose place. \\n\\njerry: really. \\n\\ntierney: have you ever seen the show? \\n\\njerry: no. \\n\\ntierney: you can admit it jerry. it\\'s okay. \\n\\njerry: i admit it. i don\\'t watch it. \\n\\ntierney: hey lou, maybe we should put him on the poly. \\n\\njerry: the poly? \\n\\ntierney: yeah. i think you\\'ve seen it. \\n\\nelaine: melrose place? \\n\\njerry: yes. melrose place. \\n\\nelaine: i just didn\\'t know you watched that. \\n\\njerry: well i do. \\n\\nelaine: i mean every time i mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation. \\n\\njerry: well maybe i was a little embarrassed. \\n\\nelaine: you mean this whole time we could have been discussing sydney and michael and jane... \\n\\njerry: and billy and jake and allison, yes we could have discussed it. \\n\\nelaine: why? why were you so embarrassed? \\n\\njerry: the point is i\\'m going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle\\'s going to be going wild. \\n\\nelaine: that is *so* stupid. why don\\'t you just confess? \\n\\njerry: it\\'s too stupid to confess. look at what i\\'m confessing to. \\n\\nelaine: so what are you going to do? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know. maybe i can beat the machine. \\n\\nelaine: oh, who do you think you are? castanza? \\n\\njerry: hey you know what? i have access to one of the most deceitful, duplicitous, deceptive minds of our time. who better to advise me? \\n\\nelaine: oh god this tastes terrible. \\n\\njerry: did you shake it up? \\n\\nelaine: no. \\n\\njerry: you gotta shake it up. \\n\\nelaine: no. i\\'m sick of shaking. you\\'ve got to shake everything. \\n\\njerry: yeah, that\\'s a real nuisance. this is killing me. \\n\\nelaine: so, i\\'m going out tonight with robert and the boss and his wife. \\n\\njerry: so tonight are you going to make the move? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, i think i might. \\n\\njerry: hey there he is. so what happened? could she detect it? \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s an interesting question. \\n\\njerry: how so? \\n\\ngeorge: how so? i\\'ll tell you how so. she\\'s bald! \\n\\nelaine: what do you mean bald? \\n\\ngeorge: what do you think i mean bald? bald. bald bald. \\n\\njerry: she\\'s bald? \\n\\ngeorge: she\\'s bald. \\n\\nelaine: oh come on. \\n\\ngeorge: oh come on? no come on. she took off her hat and there she was (waving his hand over his head) hello. it was like i was looking at myself in the mirror. \\n\\nelaine: well maybe she got a haircut or something. \\n\\ngeorge: let me tell you something. no one walks into a beauty parlor and says \"give me the larry fine.\" \\n\\njerry: women go bald? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, i\\'ve heard of that. i mean they usually wear a wig. \\n\\njerry: hey. \\n\\nkramer: hey. \\n\\ngeorge: you fixed me up with a bald woman. \\n\\nkramer: bald? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, that\\'s right. \\n\\nelaine: do you see the irony here? you\\'re rejecting somebody because they\\'re bald. \\n\\ngeorge: so? \\n\\nelaine: (puts her hands up to her mouth) you\\'re bald! \\n\\ngeorge: no i\\'m not. i *was* bald. \\n\\ngeorge: elaine. \\n\\ngeorge: no, no, no elaine. \\n\\nelaine: (shouting) i don\\'t like this thing. and here\\'s what i\\'m doing with it. \\n\\ngeorge: nooooo. \\n\\nrobert: hahaha, why\\'d you start that fight with me? \\n\\nelaine: well i figured that\\'s what couples do. \\n\\nrobert: you almost convinced me we were a couple. \\n\\nelaine: well it was easy. really. \\n\\nrobert: well good night, i\\'ll call you tomorrow. \\n\\nelaine: oh, uh, wait a second. would you like to come, upstairs? \\n\\nrobert: upstairs? \\n\\nelaine: yeah. upstairs? \\n\\nrobert: elaine... \\n\\nelaine: i was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... changing teams? \\n\\nrobert: changing teams? \\n\\nelaine: have you ever thought about it? \\n\\nrobert: but i\\'m a starting shortstop. \\n\\nelaine: robert, we need a shortstop. *real bad*. \\n\\ngeorge: i tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. i feel like my old self again. totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic, it\\'s a pleasure. \\n\\njerry: good to have you back. \\n\\ngeorge: and you know what else i\\'ve decided to do? i\\'m going to keep seeing the bald woman. \\n\\njerry: she\\'s as good as anybody else. \\n\\ngeorge: her scalp was clean. she had a nice skull. there just wasn\\'t a lot of hair on it. \\n\\njerry: yeah you\\'ve had like a religious awakening. you\\'re like a bald-again. \\n\\ngeorge: going to need a little more coffee here. \\n\\njerry: so george, how do i beat this lie detector? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m sorry, jerry i can\\'t help you. \\n\\njerry: come on, you\\'ve got the gift. you\\'re the only one that can help me. \\n\\ngeorge: jerry, i can\\'t. it\\'s like saying to pavorotti, \"teach me to sing like you.\" \\n\\njerry: all right, well i\\'ve got to go take this test. i can\\'t believe i\\'m doing this. \\n\\ngeorge: jerry, just remember. it\\'s not a lie... if you believe it. \\n\\nelaine: hey, i did it. \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nelaine: i turned him. he defected. \\n\\njerry: get out! (pushes elaine) how? how did you do that? \\n\\nelaine: because i\\'m a *woman*. (swiveling her hips) ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom- boom. \\n\\njerry: elaine, do you know what you\\'ve done? you\\'ve give hope to every woman who\\'s ever said \"too bad he\\'s gay\". \\n\\nelaine: well it\\'s a lesson for the kids out there. anything\\'s possible. jeromy, i have *hit* the jackpot. the perfect man. nothing but sex and shopping. \\n\\nlou: what\\'s your name? \\n\\njerry: jerry seinfeld. \\n\\nlou: what is your address? \\n\\njerry: 129 west 81st street. \\n\\nlou: did kimberly steal jo\\'s baby? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know. \\n\\nlou: did billy sleep with allison\\'s best friend? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know. \\n\\nlou: did jane\\'s finance kidnap sydney and take her to las vegas? and if so, did she enjoy it? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know. \\n\\nlou: did jane sleep with michael again? \\n\\njerry: (he hesitates) yes! that stupid idiot. he left her for kimberly, he slept with her sister. he tricked her into giving him half her business, and then she goes ahead and sleeps with him again. i mean she\\'s crazy. how could she do something like that? oh that jane, she makes me so mad. \\n\\njerry: he went back? what do you mean he went back? \\n\\nelaine: he went back. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t understand it. you were having such a great time, the sex, the shopping. \\n\\nelaine: well here\\'s the thing. being a woman, i only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what, thirty, forty-five minutes a week. and that\\'s on a good week. how can i be expected to have the same expertise as people who *own* this equipment, and have access to it twenty-four hours a day, their entire lives. \\n\\njerry: you can\\'t. that\\'s why they lose very few players. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, i guess i never really stood a chance. \\n\\njerry: well there\\'s always a place for you, on our team. \\n\\nelaine: yeah. (teary-eyed) thanks. is melrose place on? \\n\\njerry: yeah. it\\'s coming on in a few minutes. \\n\\nelaine: okay. \\n\\njerry: hey. don\\'t worry it hasn\\'t started. \\n\\nelaine: hey george, i am *really* proud of you. i really do admire what you\\'ve done. \\n\\ngeorge: do you? that makes me so happy. elaine\\'s proud of me jerry. \\n\\nelaine: what is the matter? \\n\\ngeorge: i got rejected by a bald woman. a bald woman rejected me. heh, you like that one? a woman with no prospects and no *hair*, told me that i wasn\\'t her type. apparently *baldy* likes a slimmer guy. \\n\\nkramer: well i\\'ll tell you what i think. i think she saw you with that piece off and was devastated. you blew it boy. you really blew it. and you had to ruin it for him. didn\\'t you? \\n\\nelaine: i didn\\'t ruin anything. he looked like an idiot. he did, and it made him act like a jerk. \\n\\njerry: all right, shut up, shut up, melrose place is coming on. \\n\\njerry: oh that michael, i hate him, he\\'s just so smug. \\n\\nkramer: hey, how you doing stu? eddie, my man. you again? boy, you\\'re a slippery one. you\\'d better straighten up and fly right buddy boy. \\n\\nman: i\\'ve got an eyewitness to that jewelry store break-in. come here. do you recognize anybody in the lineup? \\n\\nhomeless man: that\\'s the guy officer. the guy there in the middle. the tall guy with the, with the high hair. i\\'d recognize him anywhere. \\n\\nman: hey you, you with the high hair, step forward. \\n\\nkramer: me? \\n\\ngeorge: say it\\'s saturday night in spain. they go out dancing. you think they do the flamenco? \\n\\njerry: i would think. \\n\\ngeorge: so you could call a woman for a date, ask her if she\\'s free for dinner and a flamenco? \\n\\njerry: (scoffs) you don\\'t flamenco on the first date. \\n\\ngeorge: boy, i wish the flamenco was popular here. \\n\\njerry: yeah? would you do it? \\n\\ngeorge: yes, i think i would. \\n\\njerry: well, i knew you\\'d have an affinity for it, because it\\'s the dance of a very proud people. \\n\\njerry: hello.

(getting excited) they\\'re so mentally gifted that we mustn\\'t disturb the delicate genius unless it\\'s in the confines of an office. (worked up) when huge sums of money are involved, then the delicate genius can be disturbed! \\n\\nelaine: george, you got a little something, right here. \\n\\ngeorge: (wiping the area with a hand) people think they\\'re so important... \\n\\njerry: (adamant) well, i\\'m going on record right now that that was my last kiss hello. i am getting off the kiss program with her. \\n\\nelaine: why? \\n\\njerry: well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, i don\\'t see the point to it. i\\'m not thrilled with all the handshaking either, but one step at a time. \\n\\ngeorge: (regarding the menu) what\\'re you getting? \\n\\njerry: (to elaine) and what\\'s with that hairdo, by the way? \\n\\nelaine: huh, yeah, i know. it\\'s not very flattering. \\n\\njerry: she looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. you should say something to her. \\n\\nelaine: oh, i could never say anything to her about that. \\n\\njerry: yeah. kramer\\'s the only person who could say something like that. \\n\\nelaine: yeah. hah. \\n\\ngeorge: well, just tell kramer to tell her. \\n\\nelaine: no. if you tell him to do it, he\\'ll never do it. \\n\\njerry: what you have to do is introduce him, and then he\\'ll just come out with it. \\n\\nelaine: (sharp intake of breath) hoh. yes, yes, you\\'re right. that\\'s right. i\\'ll bring her over to meet... \\n\\nelaine: (to kramer) ...kramer. \\n\\nkramer: hello, boys and girls. \\n\\njerry: speak of the devil. \\n\\nkramer: yeah. hey listen, i uh, i need a picture of you, buddy. \\n\\njerry: what for? \\n\\nkramer: well, i\\'m uh, i\\'m putting everybody\\'s picture up in the lobby of our building. \\n\\njerry: why? \\n\\nkramer: so everyone will know everybody\\'s name. see, people are gonna be a lot friendlier. \\n\\njerry: (reluctant) i, i don\\'t want my picture plastered up in the lobby. \\n\\nkramer: imagine walking by someone on the floor, and you say \"hey, carl!\" and he says \"hey, jerry!\" you see, that\\'s the kind of society i wanna live in. \\n\\njerry: (still reluctant) kramer, i don\\'t wanna stop and talk with everyone, every time i go in the building. i just wanna nod and be on my way. \\n\\nkramer: (to elaine) you know your eyeliner\\'s smudged a little. why do you wear so much eye makeup? \\n\\nelaine: (to jerry, indicating kramer) yeah. this is gonna work out just fine. \\n\\nleo: ma! again with the ketchup? don\\'t they have \\'em in the plastic squeeze containers? \\n\\nleo: (traditional greeting) jerry! hello! \\n\\njerry: hello, uncle leo! \\n\\nleo: what\\'re you doing here? \\n\\njerry: nana called me to open the ketchup bottle. \\n\\nleo: yeah, me too. \\n\\nnana: hello jerry. \\n\\njerry: hi nana. \\n\\nleo: aren\\'t you gonna kiss her hello? \\n\\njerry: yes.

(gleeful) mom\\'s coming to get you. \\n\\nkramer: i thought jerry didn\\'t want that couch, because of the stain? \\n\\nfrank: what stain? \\n\\nkramer: oh, you didn\\'t notice? it has a pee-stain. \\n\\nfrank: (disbelief) you had me sleeping on a pee-stained couch? \\n\\ngeorge: (light) no. no, no, no. the cushion was turned over. \\n\\nfrank: (anger) but, the very idea. you had me lying in urine!! \\n\\ngeorge: ah! there\\'s mom, there\\'s mom. \\n\\nestelle: is it safe to come in? \\n\\ngeorge: oh, of course. (motioning estelle to enter) of course. \\n\\nestelle: you\\'re not having any of your transvestite parties? \\n\\nfrank: will you stop it? \\n\\nestelle: (to kramer) i lived with him for forty years, i never saw him trying on my underwear. as soon as he leaves the house, he turns into j. edgar hoover! \\n\\nfrank: here, cosmo... \\n\\nkramer: oh, hey. \\n\\nfrank: ...you can have the hi-fi.

(opens up the envelope) assman? oh, no, these don\\'t belong to me. i\\'m not the assman. i think there\\'s been a mistake. \\n\\nclerk: what\\'s your name again? \\n\\nkramer: cosmo kramer. \\n\\nclerk: (checks computer again) cosmo kramer. you *are* the assman. \\n\\nkramer: no! i\\'m not the assman. \\n\\nclerk: well, as far as the state of new york is concerned, you are. \\n\\ndavid: how do you feel? \\n\\nelaine: fine. \\n\\ndavid: something the matter? \\n\\nelaine: no. \\n\\ndavid: then what is it? \\n\\nelaine: no, nothing. \\n\\njerry: hi. \\n\\nelaine: i was with david *putty* last night. \\n\\njerry: yeah, so. \\n\\nelaine: he did the move. \\n\\njerry: what move? \\n\\nelaine: you know...*the* move. \\n\\njerry: wait a second. *my* move? \\n\\njerry: david putty used *my* move? \\n\\nelaine: yes, yes. \\n\\njerry: are you sure? \\n\\nelaine: jerry! there is no confusing *that* move with any other move. \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t believe it. he *stole* my move. \\n\\nelaine: what else did you tell (reaches over to slap jerry) him. (does it again) the two of you must have had *quite* a little chat! \\n\\njerry: oh, it wasn\\'t like that! i didn\\'t even mention you. you know, we were in the garage. you know how garages are. they\\'re conducive to sex talk. it\\'s a high-testosterone area. \\n\\nelaine: because of all the pistons and the lube jobs? \\n\\njerry: well, i\\'m going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it. \\n\\nelaine: well, wait---wait a second. \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nelaine: isn\\'t that a little...rash? \\n\\njerry: no! he stole my move! \\n\\nelaine: yeah, but...*i* like the move. \\n\\njerry: yeah, but it\\'s like another comedian stealing my material. \\n\\nelaine: well, he doesn\\'t even do it exactly the same. he--he--he uses a pinch at the end instead of the *swirl*! \\n\\njerry: oh, yeah. the pinch. *i\\'ve* done the pinch. that\\'s not new. besides which, i don\\'t know how you could trust any of his moves now. his whole *repertoire* could be lifted. \\n\\nelaine: you know, it\\'s strange, because he\\'s such an honest mechanic. \\n\\njerry: i know, he\\'s probably the only honest mechanic in new york. \\n\\njerry: ...so he stole my move and he\\'s using it on elaine. \\n\\ngeorge: you told david putty your move and you didn\\'t tell *me*? i *need* a move. you know i have no moves, jerry. (points to the candy bar) gimme a bite. \\n\\njerry: can i just get it opened first? \\n\\ngeorge: i can\\'t believe you\\'re hoarding sex moves. i\\'m out there rubbing two sticks together. you walk around with a zippo. \\n\\njerry: all right, all right. here. (hands george a piece of the candy bar). \\n\\ngeorge: (takes a bite) oh, that\\'s good. that\\'s very good. \\n\\njerry: you feel better? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, much better. all right, so what\\'s the move, because i need *something*. this woman i\\'m dating, it\\'s like she\\'s doing her nails during love-making. \\n\\njerry: nancy klopper? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. never seen anyone so bored. i\\'m working like a dog here. give me a moan. *something*. i\\'d settle for a belch, for god\\'s sake. all right, come on, let\\'s have it. \\n\\njerry: all right, george. i\\'m gonna tell you. but i just wanna make sure, before--- \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, yeah, yeah. it\\'s in the vault. i\\'m putting it in the vault. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s not even a question of that. the point is when something like this is passed along, one must be certain that it\\'s going to be used in a *conscientious* way. this is not some parlor trick to be used--- \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'re gonna tell me...or not. \\n\\njerry: all right. on your bed. you got a headboard? you\\'ll need a headboard. \\n\\ngeorge: i got a headboard. \\n\\njerry: is it padded? \\n\\ngeorge: no. \\n\\njerry: good. how tall is she? \\n\\ngeorge: five-foot four. why? \\n\\njerry: you can\\'t have more than a one-foot differential in your heights. otherwise, you could really hurt your neck. \\n\\ngeorge: i can\\'t tell ya how much i appreciate this. \\n\\njerry: george, if you could master this, you\\'ll never be alone again. \\n\\n[back at jerry\\'s apartment: jerry and george have just walked in, still conversing on the same subject] \\n\\njerry: now, the ending is kind of an option. i use the swirl. i like the swirl. i\\'m comfortable with the swirl. *i* feel the swirl is a great capper. he uses the pinch, which i find a little presumptuous. \\n\\ngeorge: is it a clockwise swirl? \\n\\njerry: i prefer clockwise, but it\\'s not written in stone. \\n\\nkramer: here you go, buddy. (shows it to jerry). \\n\\njerry: what is it? \\n\\nkramer: *fusilli* jerry! it\\'s made from fusilli pasta. see the microphone? \\n\\njerry: when did you do this? \\n\\nkramer: in my spare time. (turns to george). you know, i\\'m working on one of you, george. i\\'m using ravioli. see, the hard part is to find a pasta that captures the individual. \\n\\njerry: oh... why fusilli? \\n\\nkramer: because *you\\'re* silly. get it? (hands the fusilli to jerry) yeah... \\n\\njerry: well, thank you very much. \\n\\ngeorge: so, did you get your new plates? \\n\\nkramer: oh...yeah. i got my new plates. but they mixed them up. somebody got mine and i got their *vanity* plates. \\n\\ngeorge: what do they say? \\n\\nkramer: assman. \\n\\njerry: assman? \\n\\nkramer: yeah. assman, jerry. i\\'m cosmo kramer, the assman! \\n\\njerry: who would order a license plate that says \"assman\"? \\n\\ngeorge: maybe they\\'re wilt chamberlain\\'s. \\n\\njerry: it doesn\\'t have to be someone who gets a lot of women. it could be just some guy with a big ass. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, or it could be a proctologist. \\n\\njerry: yeah. proctologist. \\n\\ngeorge: come on! no doctor would put that on his car. \\n\\nkramer: have you ever *met* a proctologist? well, they usually have a very good sense of humor. you meet a proctologist at a party, don\\'t walk away. *plant* yourself there, because you will hear the funniest stories you\\'ve ever heard. see, no one wants to admit to them that they *stuck* something up there. never! it\\'s always an accident. every proctologist story ends in the same way \"it was a million to one shot, doc. million to one.\" \\n\\nkramer: oh! there\\'s my phone. (he leaves) \\n\\ngeorge: so, where you gonna stick this (points to the fusilli jerry) \\n\\njerry: i\\'ll tell you where i\\'d like to stick it. \\n\\njerry: hey, david. \\n\\ndavid: oh, hi, jerry. \\n\\njerry: hey, what\\'s the story? i hear you\\'re doing my move. \\n\\ndavid: what move? \\n\\njerry: what move? *my* move. the one i told you about. you used it on elaine. \\n\\ndavid: you\\'re move? what, are you kidding? i was doing that before i knew you. all you told me about was the ending. \\n\\njerry: the ending is the whole thing. without the ending, it\\'s nothing. you had *nothing*. \\n\\ndavid: oh, that ending was *so* obvious. i would have figured it out anyway. i didn\\'t need you to tell me that stupid twist. \\n\\njerry: swirl. \\n\\ndavid: whatever. i don\\'t even do it. \\n\\njerry: oh, yeah, i know. you do the *pinch*. \\n\\ndavid: yeah, that\\'s right. \\n\\njerry: you can\\'t come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other peoples? you\\'re nothing but a hack. \\n\\ndavid: are you through, \\'cuz, uh, i gotta get back to work. \\n\\njerry: well, i\\'ll tell you what i\\'ll do, you know. if you wanna do it out of town...okay. but not in the city. \\n\\ndavid: all right, how about the next time your car breaks down, you take *that* out of town. \\n\\njerry: fine. \\n\\ndavid: good! \\n\\nnancy: ow, george!

(he leaves) \\n\\ngeorge: check, please. \\n\\nwaiter: hey, sugar ray leonard can eat here on the house. \\n\\ngeorge: mr. morgan! did you hear that? mr. morgan! \\n\\ngeorge: take toilet paper for example. do you realize that toilet paper has not changed in my lifetime? it\\'s just paper on a cardboard roll, that\\'s it. and in ten thousand years, it will still be exactly the same because really, what else can they do? \\n\\nsiena: that\\'s true. there really has been no development in toilet paper. \\n\\ngeorge: and everything else has changed. but toilet paper is exactly the same, and will be so until we\\'re dead. \\n\\nsiena: yeah, you\\'re right george. what else can they do? \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s just paper on a roll, that\\'s it. and that\\'s all it will ever be. \\n\\nsiena: wow. \\n\\ngeorge: you find this interesting, don\\'t you? \\n\\nsiena: yes. yes, i do. \\n\\nelaine: (to the busboy) oh, thanks very much, the soup was really good. \\n\\njerry: what are you telling him for? \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\njerry: he\\'s the busboy, you think he cares about the soup? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, why? wouldn\\'t he want the soup to be good? \\n\\njerry: elaine, it\\'s all this guy can do to keep from killing himself. you think he\\'s back there, talking to the chef, going, \"hey, they like the soup! keep it up!\"? \\n\\nelaine: hey, isn\\'t that alec berg? \\n\\njerry: yep, alec berg. he\\'s got a good \\'john houseman\\' name. alec beeerg. mr. beeerg. \\n\\nelaine: i can\\'t stand him, he is so pretentious. \\n\\njerry: john houseman? \\n\\nelaine: no, alec berg. \\n\\nalec: (approaching) elaine! \\n\\nelaine: hi! \\n\\nalec: hi, how are you? jerry. \\n\\njerry: hi, alec. \\n\\nalec: did you hear about gary fogel? \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\nalec: you gonna go to the funeral on friday? \\n\\njerry: yeah, hey did i see you on tv at the ranger game? were those your seats right behind the glass? \\n\\nalec: those are them, yeah. season tickets. uh, you know, unfortunately i can\\'t go tonight, so they\\'re available if you\\'d like to use them. \\n\\njerry: oh, i\\'d love to, are you sure? \\n\\nalec: absolutely, you just call my secretary, she\\'ll arrange everything. \\n\\njerry: gee thanks! thanks a lot! \\n\\nalec: it\\'s my pleasure. be good. (walking away, he stops abruptly) you know, i actually might not use them on friday either so i\\'ll let you know. \\n\\njerry: alright, thanks again. \\n\\nelaine: thank you very much. \\n\\njerry: really, thank you. \\n\\njerry: well what about these nitwits that get on a plane with nothing to read? you know who these people are? \\n\\nelaine: who? \\n\\njerry: these are the people that want to talk to you. they got nothing else to do, why not disturb you? \\n\\nelaine: i will never understand people. \\n\\njerry: they\\'re the worst. \\n\\ngeorge: something\\'s up, there\\'s something in the air. \\n\\njerry: well, what is with you? \\n\\ngeorge: well, i think this is it. \\n\\nelaine: what\\'s it? \\n\\ngeorge: i saw siena again. \\n\\nelaine: siena? \\n\\njerry: yeah, he\\'s dating a crayon. \\n\\ngeorge: we discussed toilet paper. \\n\\njerry: toilet paper? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, i told her how toilet paper hasn\\'t changed in my lifetime, and probably wouldn\\'t change in the next fifty thousand years and she was fascinated, fascinated! \\n\\njerry: what are you talking about? \\n\\nelaine: yeah. \\n\\njerry: toilet paper\\'s changed. \\n\\nelaine: yeah. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s softer. \\n\\nelaine: softer. \\n\\njerry: more sheets per roll \\n\\nelaine: sheets. \\n\\njerry: comes in a wide variety of colors. \\n\\nelaine: colors. \\n\\ngeorge: ok, ok, fine! it\\'s changed, it\\'s not really the point. anyway, i\\'m thinking of making a big move. \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\ngeorge: i might tell her that i love her. i came this close last night, then i just chickened out. \\n\\njerry: well, that\\'s a big move, georgie boy. are you confident in the \\'i love you\\' return? \\n\\ngeorge: fifty-fifty. \\n\\njerry: cause if you don\\'t get that return, that\\'s a pretty big matzoh ball hanging out there. \\n\\ngeorge: aw, i\\'ve just got to say it once, everybody else gets to say it, why can\\'t i say it? \\n\\nelaine: what, you never said it? \\n\\ngeorge: once, to a dog. he licked himself and left the room. \\n\\njerry: well, so it wasn\\'t a total loss. \\n\\nkramer: hey. \\n\\njerry: hey, i forgot to tell you! i got tickets to the rangers-devils playoff game tonight! \\n\\nkramer: oh, i\\'m there, monongahela! \\n\\njerry: what about you, george? \\n\\ngeorge: eh eh eh, can\\'t do it, can\\'t do it, sorry, i got a date. \\n\\nkramer: so, so. \\n\\ngeorge: oh no no no, if you must know, i would rather be with her than go to the game. \\n\\nkramer: she must be a very special lady, huh george, yeah. \\n\\njerry: well, what do i do with the extra ticket? \\n\\nelaine: oh hey, can i bring david puddy? he\\'s a big devils\\' fan. \\n\\njerry: sure, fine with me. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, by the way, if anybody wants an inside tour of the zoo, siena works there as a trainer. \\n\\nkramer: so she works at the zoo? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, yeah. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, like diane fosse. you know she\\'s the only person that\\'s ever been accepted into gorilla society. and you know, once those gorillas accept you, you got it made in the shade. \\n\\nelaine: so how long have you been a devils\\' fan? \\n\\npuddy: (off camera) since i was a kid, i\\'m from jersey. \\n\\nelaine: yeah? well, we\\'re gonna kick your butts tonight. \\n\\npuddy: hey, no way, man. \\n\\nelaine: yes. \\n\\npuddy: we\\'re primed. \\n\\nelaine: alright, you almost ready? cause jerry and kramer are gonna be here any second. \\n\\nelaine: what the-- \\n\\npuddy: so what do you think? \\n\\nelaine: what is that? \\n\\npuddy: i painted my face. \\n\\nelaine: (still in disbelief) you painted your face? \\n\\npuddy: yeah. \\n\\nelaine: why? \\n\\npuddy: you know, support the team. \\n\\nelaine: well, you can\\'t walk around like that. \\n\\npuddy: why not? \\n\\nelaine: because it\\'s insane? \\n\\npuddy: hey, you gotta let them know you\\'re out there, this is the playoffs. \\n\\nkramer: hey. \\n\\npuddy: hey. \\n\\nelaine: dave, um, painted his face. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, that\\'s cool. well, you gotta support your team. \\n\\npuddy: ok, ready to go? \\n\\nkramer: yeah. \\n\\npuddy: (startlingly loud) let\\'s get it on!!! alright!! go devils!! go devils!! let\\'s go devils!! \\n\\npuddy: you\\'re dead, messier! we\\'re gonna get you, messier! \\n\\nfan #1: will you sit down? \\n\\npuddy: hey man, i\\'m just trying to support the team. \\n\\nelaine: will you sit down? you\\'re disturbing everybody. sit down! \\n\\npuddy: oh yeah, because you\\'re a ranger fan and you know i\\'m messing with their heads. \\n\\npuddy: go devils!! \\n\\nradio announcer: devils goal! stephan richer scores from just inside the blue line! and the devils take-- (george turns down the volume) \\n\\ngeorge: you know, i could have actually gone to that. \\n\\nsiena: so why didn\\'t you? \\n\\ngeorge: well, i didn\\'t want to break our date. \\n\\nsiena: oh, well. \\n\\ngeorge: because i... i love you. \\n\\nsiena: you know, i\\'m hungry. let\\'s get something to eat. \\n\\npuddy: ha ha! we took it to you! you couldn\\'t get it out of your zone all night. we were aggressive, we didn\\'t let you penetrate! \\n\\nkramer: alright, that\\'s enough out of you, there\\'s still three more games left in this series, my friend, and it\\'s far from being over. very far from being over. (notices a car coming right towards puddy, who\\'s crossing the street) watch out! \\n\\npuddy: (pounding the hood) hey, what are you doing?! watch where you\\'re driving, man! (he approaches the passenger side window) don\\'t mess with the devils, buddy. we\\'re number one, we beat anybody! we\\'re the devils! the devils!! haaaa!!! \\n\\nfather hernandez: el diablo! dios mio! el diablo!! \\n\\njerry: \"i\\'m hungry. let\\'s get something to eat.\" \\n\\ngeorge: yup. \\n\\njerry: big matzoh ball. \\n\\ngeorge: huge matzoh ball. \\n\\njerry: those damn \\'i love you\\' returns. \\n\\ngeorge: well, it\\'s all over. i slipped up. \\n\\njerry: oh, you don\\'t know. \\n\\ngeorge: you have any idea how fast these things deteriorate when there\\'s an \\'i love you\\' out of the bag? you can\\'t have a relationship where one person says, \"i love you\", and the other says, \"i\\'m hungry. let\\'s get something to eat.\". \\n\\njerry: unless you\\'re married. \\n\\ngeorge: i mean, now she thinks that i\\'m one of these guys that love her. nobody wants to be with somebody that loves them. \\n\\njerry: no, people hate that. \\n\\ngeorge: you want to be with somebody that doesn\\'t like you. \\n\\njerry: ideally. \\n\\ngeorge: i am never saying \\'i love you\\' again unless they say it first. \\n\\nwaitress: matzoh ball soup? \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'d be me. \\n\\nkramer: hey, jerry? you\\'re a smart guy, right? \\n\\njerry: no question about it. \\n\\nkramer: alright, you know i\\'m supposed to go on this special tour today with george\\'s girlfriend. \\n\\njerry: at the zoo? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, but before i met up with her, i stopped to look at the monkeys, when all of a sudden i am hit in the face with a banana peel. i turn and look and there is this monkey really laughing it up. then someone tells me that he did it. well, i pick up the banana peel and i wait for that monkey to turn around. and then i *whap* let him have it. \\n\\njerry: kramer, you threw a banana peel at a monkey? \\n\\nkramer: well, he started it! \\n\\njerry: it\\'s a monkey, kramer! \\n\\nkramer: well, he pushed my buttons, i couldn\\'t help it, jerry. \\n\\njerry: well, i still think it\\'s wrong. \\n\\nkramer: alright, alright, fine. you take the monkey\\'s side, alright, go ahead. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m not taking anyone\\'s side. \\n\\nkramer: (walking out) cause i know what happened, jerry. (remembering something and walking back in) did you call alec berg and thank him for the hockey tickets? \\n\\njerry: no. \\n\\nkramer: oh, jerry, what are you waiting for? \\n\\njerry: what do i gotta call him for? i thanked him five times when he gave them to me, how many time i gotta thank him? \\n\\nkramer: oh, no no no, you gotta call him the next day, it\\'s common courtesy. \\n\\njerry: no, i don\\'t believe in it. i\\'m taking a stand against all this over thanking. \\n\\nkramer: jerry, good manners are the glue of society. \\n\\njerry: hey, if i knew i had to give him eight million \\'thank you\\'s, i wouldn\\'t have taken the tickets in the first place. \\n\\nkramer: alright, you know what this is gonna do? he\\'s gonna be upset because you didn\\'t call him and we\\'re not gonna get those tickets for friday night. \\n\\njerry: ah, you\\'re out of your mind. \\n\\nkramer: alright, where you going? \\n\\njerry: i gotta get a suit cleaned, i have a funeral on friday. \\n\\nkramer: who died? \\n\\njerry: remember the guy who pretended he had cancer so o would buy him the toupee? \\n\\nkramer: so he actually had it? \\n\\njerry: no, car accident. he was trying to adjust his toupee while he was driving and he lost control of the car. \\n\\nelaine: that poor priest. he was just visiting from el salvador. now he\\'s gone completely loco. \\n\\njerry: the one puddy screamed at in the car? \\n\\nelaine: yeah. he thinks he saw the devil. he won\\'t leave his room in the church basement. \\n\\njerry: well, that\\'s what you get for getting mixed up with a face painter. \\n\\nelaine: i mean, what compels a seemingly normal human being to do something like that? \\n\\njerry: gotta support the team. \\n\\nelaine: you know i really hate my clothes. \\n\\njerry: hm. \\n\\nelaine: i open up my closet, there\\'s just nothing. \\n\\njerry: hm. \\n\\nelaine: nothing. i hate everything i have, i really hate it. (the weeping increases in volume and intensity) i mean, at this point, it\\'s like i can wear something three or four times and that\\'s it. \\n\\njerry: hm. \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s getting to be a terrible problem for me. \\n\\njerry: (noticing alec berg walk in, whispers) hey, alec! \\n\\njerry: did you see that? what kind of a \\'hello\\' was that? \\n\\nmr. pless: ah, mr. kramer? \\n\\nkramer: yes. \\n\\nmr. pless: thanks for coming. \\n\\nkramer: so, uh, what did you want to see me about? \\n\\nmr. pless: well, mr. kramer, to get right to it, we\\'re having a bit of a problem with barry. \\n\\nkramer: barry? \\n\\nmr. pless: the chimpanzee. \\n\\nkramer: oh. well, uh, what\\'s the problem? \\n\\nmr. pless: well, he\\'s not functioning the way he normally does. he seems depressed. he\\'s lost his appetite. he\\'s even curtailed his autoerotic activities. and we think this is directly related to the altercation he had with you the other day. \\n\\nkramer: so, so what do you want me to do? \\n\\nmr. pless: well, frankly we\\'d like you to apologize. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, well he started it. \\n\\nmr. pless: mr. kramer, he is an innocent primate. \\n\\nkramer: so am i. what about my feelings? don\\'t my feelings count for anything? oh, only the poor monkey\\'s important. everything has to be done for the monkey! look, i\\'m sorry. i-- \\n\\nsiena: hey, that\\'s ok. well, i\\'ve gotta go feed the marmosets. \\n\\nkramer: (to siena as she\\'s walking out, but she appears to ignore) you know george really likes you. \\n\\nmr. pless: she doesn\\'t hear too well out of her left ear. \\n\\nkramer: oh. \\n\\njerry: i mean, do you think it\\'s possible that he\\'s mad at me because he didn\\'t get the day-after \\'thank you\\'? \\n\\ngeorge: wait a minute, you were at a funeral, right? \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: well, people never give a good \\'hello\\' at a funeral. i mean, they go like this (george gives an extremely understated nod) that\\'s the biggest. \\n\\njerry: yeah, yeah, that\\'s kinda what he gave me. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, they can\\'t go, \"hey! you look fabulous!\" \\n\\njerry: hey. \\n\\nkramer: hey. well, i just spoke to your girlfriend. \\n\\ngeorge: girlfriend, yeah, right. \\n\\nkramer: anyway, she asked me to apologize to barry. \\n\\ngeorge: barry? \\n\\nkramer: the monkey. \\n\\njerry: well? \\n\\nkramer: nothing doing. jerry, i didn\\'t do anything. it\\'s the monkey that should be apologizing to me. \\n\\njerry: well, i don\\'t think that\\'s gonna happen. \\n\\nkramer: well, i\\'m sorry. well, george, i tried to put the good word in for you with siena, but i don\\'t think she heard me. you know, left ear? \\n\\ngeorge: what? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, her boss told me that she can\\'t hear very well out of her left ear. what, you didn\\'t know that? \\n\\ngeorge: oh my god. \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\ngeorge: she probably never heard it. don\\'t you see what this means? it\\'s like the whole thing never happened. it\\'s like when superman reversed the rotation of the earth to save lois lane! \\n\\njerry: are you gonna say it again? \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s the question, jimmy. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m gonna do it. \\n\\njerry: what? after what you just went through, i thought you said you\\'d never say it again. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'d like to say it once to someone that can actually hear it! \\n\\nkramer: what\\'s going on? \\n\\njerry: he\\'s gonna talk into her other ear. \\n\\nkramer: oh. well listen, i almost forgot to ask you. what happened at the funeral? now, did you talk to alec berg? \\n\\njerry: yeah, i saw him. \\n\\nkramer: alright, so he\\'s gonna give you the hockey tickets, huh? \\n\\njerry: well, not exactly. \\n\\nkramer: he\\'s mad, isn\\'t he? see, i knew it. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know if he\\'s mad. \\n\\nkramer: alright, so what happened when you saw him? \\n\\njerry: well, i didn\\'t really get a good \\'hello\\', but see, i was at a funeral. \\n\\nkramer: uh huh. \\n\\njerry: see, so i don\\'t know if i got a funeral \\'hello\\' or he was mad because he didn\\'t get his day-after \\'thank you\\'. \\n\\nkramer: see, i told you, jerry, i told you! \\n\\njerry: look, what do you want me to do? \\n\\nkramer: i want you to get on this phone and give him his \\'thank you\\'! \\n\\njerry: no. no, i can\\'t! \\n\\nkramer: jerry, this is the way society functions. aren\\'t you a part of society? because if you don\\'t want to be a part of society, jerry, why don\\'t you just get in your car and move to the east side! \\n\\njerry: look, we got five hours before the game. i am betting it was a funeral \\'hello\\'. he knows we\\'re here, he knows the number, he knows we want to go. there\\'s plenty of time for him to call and give us the tickets. \\n\\nkramer: you stubborn, stupid, silly man! \\n\\npuddy: hey, great dip. you made this? \\n\\nelaine: no, it\\'s from the store. \\n\\npuddy: oh. hey, how come people don\\'t have dip for dinner? why is it only a snack, why can\\'t it be a meal, you know? i don\\'t understand stuff like that. \\n\\nelaine: david? david, i think we aught to talk. \\n\\npuddy: alright, that\\'s cool. \\n\\nelaine: david, i don\\'t think we should see each other anymore. \\n\\npuddy: you gotta be kidding, how come? \\n\\nelaine: well, you see, david, you\\'re a face painter. \\n\\npuddy: yeah, that\\'s right. \\n\\nelaine: well, it\\'s not that i don\\'t like you, but, well to be perfectly honest, i\\'m just having some trouble getting past the face painting. \\n\\npuddy: well, alright, so you don\\'t like the face painting, i just won\\'t paint it anymore. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, but you like the face painting. \\n\\npuddy: well, i don\\'t need to do it. it\\'s not like a habit or anything. \\n\\nelaine: oh. you mean you\\'d stop it for me? \\n\\npuddy: yeah, that\\'s right. \\n\\nelaine: that\\'s so, that\\'s so sweet. \\n\\npuddy: ah, c\\'mere. (they kiss) alright, i gotta go home and get changed before the game. i\\'ll be back, we\\'ll make out. \\n\\ngeorge: siena, i love you. \\n\\nsiena: yeah, i know. i heard you the first time. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. just confirming. \\n\\njerry: hello? oh, hi mom. no, listen, i was expecting somebody else. i\\'m sorry, i can\\'t talk now, i gotta keep the line clear, i\\'ll call you later. yes, i know i have call waiting but i don\\'t trust it in an emergency. good bye. \\n\\nkramer: anyway, i um, i just want to say that i\\'m sorry. i lost my temper and i probably shouldn\\'t have. i took it out on you and, look, if i\\'ve caused you any problems as a result of my behavior, well then, i\\'m sorry. i apologize. even though, barry, between me and you, we both know that you started it. i mean, who\\'s kidding who? but they tell me that you\\'re very upset, and god forbid i should disturb the very important monkey, i\\'m just hoping we can put this behind us, let\\'s just move on with our lives, ok? so no hard feelings? \\n\\nelaine: what is that? \\n\\npuddy: that\\'s the letter \\'d\\'. \\n\\nelaine: why is the letter \\'d\\' painted on your chest? \\n\\npuddy: well, i\\'m going to the game tonight, and me and these five other guys are gonna take our shirts off and spell out \\'devils\\'. \\n\\nelaine: but you said no more painting. \\n\\npuddy: no, i said no more face painting, and as you can see this is not my face. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, that\\'s right. \\n\\nkramer: well? did he call? \\n\\njerry: no. \\n\\nkramer: oh, come on, jerry! come on, this is stupid! it\\'s six o\\'clock! it\\'s all over, just pick up the phone and thank him! \\n\\njerry: alright!

\\n\\njerry: come on! george is getting married! \\n\\nelaine: is he happy? \\n\\n[at the restaurant! george: is coming from the bathroom to sit with his bride-to-be.] \\n\\ngeorge: i will never understand the bathrooms in this country. why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor? \\n\\nsusan: well, maybe it\\'s so you can see if there\\'s someone in there. \\n\\ngeorge: isn\\'t that why we have locks on the doors? \\n\\nsusan: well, as a backup system, in case the lock is broken, you can see if it\\'s taken. \\n\\ngeorge: a backup system? we\\'re designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? that\\'s not a system. that\\'s a complete breakdown of the system. \\n\\nsusan: can we change the subject, please? \\n\\ngeorge: why? what\\'s wrong with the subject? this is a bad subject? \\n\\nsusan: no, fine. if you wanna keep talking about it, we\\'ll talk about it. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s not that i want to keep talking about it? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum. \\n\\nsusan: well, i didn\\'t think that it had any momentum. \\n\\ngeorge: (to himself) how am i gonna do this? i\\'m engaged to this woman? she doesn\\'t even like me. change the subject? toilets were the subject. we don\\'t even share the same interests. \\n\\njerry: yeah, he seems pretty happy. \\n\\nelaine: well, that\\'s all that counts, i guess. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s the matter? \\n\\nelaine: oh, nothin\\'. \\n\\njerry: well, you don\\'t seem too enthused about the whole thing. \\n\\nelaine: well, what do you want me to do? \\n\\njerry: well, at least have some reaction to it. \\n\\nelaine: well, i don\\'t. \\n\\njerry: maybe you\\'re a little jealous. \\n\\nelaine: oh, what? you think i wanna marry george? \\n\\njerry: no! but maybe you wish it was you who was getting married, not him. \\n\\nelaine: oh, please! that is the last thing that i want. \\n\\njerry: oh, yeah. right. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, right. \\n\\njerry: lainy! \\n\\nelaine: jerry! \\n\\njerry: you don\\'t wanna get married?

everything i\\'ve worked for...down the drain because of one stupid mistake. i mean, aren\\'t we entitled to make one mistake in our lives, jerry? \\n\\njerry: we\\'re gonna change the system. \\n\\nkramer: yes! \\n\\nelaine: well, i could care less. i hope it is on our record. i\\'m just sorry they didn\\'t lock me up. \\n\\nelaine: oh, hello, rabbi krischma. \\n\\nrabbi: elaine! always a pleasure to see you. \\n\\nelaine: thanks again for taking care of that dog for us. \\n\\nrabbi: elaine, often times in life there are problems, and just as often there are solutions. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, i suppose. \\n\\nrabbi: elaine, you don\\'t seem yourself today. you seem, if i may say, troubled. \\n\\nelaine: no, rabbi, i\\'m not myself. \\n\\nrabbi: come upstairs. we\\'ll have a talk. \\n\\njerry: hey! \\n\\ngeorge: i want your honest opinion about something. \\n\\njerry: have i ever been less than forthright?

\\n\\njerry: it should resolve of its own volition. \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s exactly what i said, except i used the word \"momentum\". \\n\\njerry: momentum - same thing. \\n\\ngeorge: same thing. my god, i\\'m getting married in december, do you know that? \\n\\njerry: yeah, i know. \\n\\ngeorge: well, i don\\'t see how i\\'m gonna make december. i mean, i need a little more time. i mean, look at me i\\'m a nervous wreck. my stomach aches. my neck is killing me. i can\\'t turn. look. look. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re turning. \\n\\ngeorge: nah, it\\'s not a good turn. december. december. don\\'t you think we should have a little more time just to get to know each other a little. \\n\\njerry: if you need more time, you should have more time. \\n\\ngeorge: what, you think i could postpone it?

(smiles behind her back) \\n\\nelaine: i\\'ve got that magazine article for you. \\n\\njerry: you iknow i talked to the rabbi outside. \\n\\nelaine: are you \\n\\njerry: understand you had a little talk with him too. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, talked earlier. \\n\\njerry: yes i know, i know. \\n\\nelaine: . . . what does that mean? \\n\\njerry: nothing, nothing. \\n\\nelaine: he didn\\'t mention . . . \\n\\njerry: yes he did. \\n\\nelaine: he told you about our conversation? \\n\\njerry: we had quite a little chat. \\n\\nelaine: he told you about . . . \\n\\njerry: yes, about how you\\'re very jealous of george. how you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him. \\n\\nelaine: he told you all that? how could he? \\n\\njerry: it didn\\'t take much prodding either, i must say. \\n\\nelaine: can he do that? \\n\\njerry: he did it. \\n\\nelaine: but he\\'s a rabbi! how can a rabbi have such a big mouth? \\n\\njerry: that\\'s what\\'s so fascinating. \\n\\njerry: you better finish your little caf latte there. they won\\'t let you in with it. \\n\\nkramer: why not? \\n\\njerry: because they don\\'t allow outside drinks into the movie. \\n\\nkramer: well that\\'s stupid \\n\\njerry: that\\'s the rule. \\n\\nkramer: well, we\\'ll just see if we can\\'t get around that. \\n\\nrabbi: oh, elaine. come in. come in. so nice to see you again. \\n\\nelaine: yeah \\n\\nrabbi: can i offere you some kasha varnishkas? \\n\\nelaine: no, no. listen, rabbi, i\\'d like to ask you a question. why, why did you tell my friend jerry what i talked to you about? \\n\\nrabbi: was that a problem for you? \\n\\nelaine: of course it was a problem for me. . . . you didn\\'t, you didn\\'t tell anyone else about this, did you? \\n\\nrabbi: well, let\\'s see? i seem to recall a conversation with mrs. winston in 1f. \\n\\nelaine: mrs. winston? \\n\\nrabbi: yes, we were waiting for our mail to arrive and i happened to mention to her how you felt that it was never going \"to happen\" for you. \\n\\nelaine: what about don ramsey? you didn\\'t mention anything to him did you? \\n\\nrabbi: don ramsey? \\n\\nelaine: you know that tall really good looking guy, he lives on the fifth floor. \\n\\nrabbi: oh him! well this morning i found myself in the elevator with him \\n\\nelaine: my god, you didn\\'t. \\n\\njerry: excuse me, pardon me, excuse me \\n\\nkramer: oh, yow, oow ah! \\n\\nusher: hey, hey, what\\'s going on? what just happened here? \\n\\nkramer: nothing nothing. \\n\\nusher: whatya got? one of those caf latte\\'s in your shirt? \\n\\nkramer: i don\\'t have anything. ask him. \\n\\nusher: all right, come on coffee boy, bring it out. \\n\\nkramer: what?! \\n\\nusher: here you go. \\n\\nkramer: ow \\n\\nelaine: but the whole thing is a mess. he told everyone in the building. i met that cute guy on the fifth floor. i mean he could barely bring himself to nod. \\n\\njerry: elaine, if i could say a word here about jewish people. that man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves. \\n\\nelaine: you didn\\'t say this to george, did you? \\n\\njerry: no, . . . about how you wish it was you who was getting married instead of him? feelings of resentment, hostility? \\n\\nelaine: yeah that! so, . . . \\n\\ngeorge: hey oh. \\n\\nelaine: georgie! congratulations! oh, my god. i haven\\'t seen you since it happened. i\\'m so happy for you. \\n\\ngeorge: alright, thanks a lot. \\n\\nelaine: oh, come on. you really, really deserve it. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, deserve! i don\\'t know if i deserve...i mean... \\n\\nelaine: are you kidding? i have seen the changes in you the past couple of years. man, you have grown. you\\'ve matured. \\n\\ngeorge: well, i guess i\\'m getting older. \\n\\nelaine: oh! well, i just think it\\'s wonderful. honestly! i\\'ve gotta run, but um, please, please give my best to susan. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. \\n\\nelaine: my most, just heartfelt congratulations. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. thanks. hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four of us could go out together sometime. \\n\\nelaine: yes! yes, yes. sure. \\n\\ngeorge: wait, as a matter of fact, wasn\\'t there some guy in your building that you said you liked? he lived up on the fifth floor or something. \\n\\nelaine: yes. yes, yes. yes. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah! boy, she is something, isn\\'t she? \\n\\njerry: yeah, she\\'s something else. hey, so what happened? did you hold your ground or...uh \\n\\ngeorge: nope. i wept like a baby. \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\ngeorge: well, i started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some reason, i just burst into tears. \\n\\njerry: you cried? \\n\\ngeorge: i bawled uncontrollably. i just poured my guts out. and i\\'ll tell you, jerry, it was incredible. i never realized how powerful these tears are. i could have postponed it another five years if i wanted to. \\n\\njerry, george, & kramer: hey! \\n\\njerry: sorry about that movie-thing. i was joking around. \\n\\nkramer: sorry? are you kidding? you did me the biggest favor of my life. i spoke to a lawyer, we\\'re suing for millions. \\n\\njerry: suing? what for? \\n\\nkramer: the coffee was too hot. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s supposed to be hot. \\n\\nkramer: not that hot. \\n\\nrabbi: (on tv) the prophet isaah tells us without friends our lives are empty and meaningless. \\n\\ngeorge: wait. whoa! that\\'s the rabbi from elaine\\'s building. i just met this guy the other day. \\n\\nrabbi: a young lady i know, let\\'s call her elaine, happened to find herself overwhelmed with feelings of resentment and hostility for her friend, let\\'s call him george. she felt that george was somewhat of a loser and that she was the one who deserved to be married first. she also happened to mention to me that her friend had wondered if going to a prostitute while you\\'re engaged is considered cheating. his feeling was they\\'re never going to see each other again so what\\'s the difference. but that is a subject for another sermon. now, i\\'d like to close with a psalm. \\n\\n[setting: booth at monk\\'s cafe] \\n\\ngeorge: and then i hear this rabbi on television, i mean imagine. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m really sorry george, i, i, i wasn\\'t jealous of you. it was just the whole marriage thing. \\n\\ngeorge: ya know, i was just a little surprised. \\n\\njerry: why would anyone eat canned fruit? i mean can anybody answer that? \\n\\ngeorge: what about all the loser stuff? \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t know where the rabbi got that. ya know i never said that. i said \"i\\'ve never seen you looser\". \\n\\njerry: i can see the can if you\\'re in the army, but fresh fruit it\\'s available, it\\'s there, it\\'s 2 aisles over. \\n\\ngeorge: (gets up to leave) well, scintillating as always. \\n\\njerry: where you going? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m going shopping with susan. \\n\\nelaine: what kind of shopping? \\n\\ngeorge: clothes shopping. \\n\\nelaine: where are you going? \\n\\ngeorge: ross\\'. \\n\\nelaine: oh that\\'s a nice store. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, it\\'s her uncle\\'s. \\n\\njerry: discount? \\n\\ngeorge: (as he leaves) one would hope. \\n\\n[setting: jackie child\\'s office] \\n\\nkramer: so ya know, my friend and i we were going to the movies and we stopped off and bought this cafe latte. \\n\\njackie: (agreeing) hm hm. oh what is that like italian coffee? \\n\\nkramer: yeah that\\'s right. \\n\\njackie: half milk, half coffee? \\n\\nkramer: yeah. \\n\\njackie: hm hm. you take a sip? \\n\\nkramer: yes i did. \\n\\njackie: now when you took a sip, did you notice it was hot? were you able to sip it in your normal fashion? \\n\\nkramer: no i wasn\\'t able to sip it in my normal fashion. \\n\\njackie: hm hm. all right, all right. you take big sips? \\n\\nkramer: well i think i take a normal sip. \\n\\njackie: o.k. you take normal sips. nothing wrong with that. then what happened? \\n\\nkramer: well you know ahh, they don\\'t allow outside drinks in the movie theater. so i had to put it in my shirt and sneak it in. \\n\\njackie: yeah, see they like to sell their own coffee. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, now is that going to be a problem? \\n\\njackie: yeah that\\'s going to be a problem. it\\'s gonna be a problem for them. this a clear violation of your rights as a consumer. it\\'s an infringement on your constitutional rights. it\\'s outrageous, egregious, preposterous. \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s definitely preposterous. \\n\\njackie: so. then what happened? \\n\\nkramer: well ahh. i was trying to get to my seat and i had to step over someone and i kind of got pushed and it spilled on me. \\n\\njackie: was there a top on it? \\n\\nkramer: yeah. \\n\\njackie: now did you put the top on or did they put the top on for you? \\n\\nkramer: no. they put the top on. \\n\\njackie: and they made the top. you didn\\'t make the top did you? \\n\\njackie: (to secretary over intercom) suzie. i want you to go down to java world. get me a cafe latte with a top. (to kramer) we\\'re gonna run some test on that top. have you been to the doctor? \\n\\nkramer: ah no no, i haven\\'t. \\n\\njackie: (to secretary over intercom) suzie. call dr. bison. set up an appointment for mr. kramer here. tell him it\\'s from me. \\n\\nkramer: so ah, what do you think mr. chiles. \\n\\njackie: jackie. \\n\\nkramer: jackie. i mean, we have a chance? \\n\\njackie: do we have a chance? you get me one coffee drinker on that jury, you gonna walk outta there a rich man. \\n\\n[setting: ross\\' clothing store] \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t like it, it\\'s red. it it\\'s too flashy. \\n\\nsusan: well you could use a little flash. \\n\\ngeorge: all right. don\\'t change me. susan. don\\'t change me. ya know there are a lot of woman that would love to be in your position right now. \\n\\nsusan: name one. \\n\\nmr ross: so, you find anything? \\n\\nsusan: oh, he\\'s impossible to shop for uncle ned. \\n\\nmr ross: i\\'m going on vacation to costa rica. maybe i\\'ll see you in a couple of weeks. \\n\\nsusan: o.k. \\n\\nsalesman: excuse me mr ross. \\n\\ngeorge: see now this i don\\'t get. \\n\\nsusan: what? \\n\\ngeorge: the security guard. \\n\\nsusan: what about him? \\n\\ngeorge: why does he have to stand? \\n\\nsusan: because he\\'s a security guard. \\n\\ngeorge: but i mean look at him. he\\'s gotta be on his feet like that all day? that\\'s brutal. i think i\\'m gonna say something to your uncle. \\n\\nsusan: george, you just met him. don\\'t say anything to him. \\n\\ngeorge: aren\\'t you concerned about the security guard? \\n\\nsusan: not really. (walks away) \\n\\ngeorge: (thinking to himself) she\\'s not concerned about the security guard. what kind of a person is this? i\\'m marrying a person who doesn\\'t care that this man has to stand here 8 hours a day when he could easily be sitting. \\n\\nsusan: all right george. (she puts the red shirt up to him again) what do you think? \\n\\n[setting: elaine and jerry are in jerry\\'s apartment.] \\n\\njerry: so ah, what did you do last night? \\n\\nelaine: nothing. \\n\\njerry: i know nothing, but what did you actually do? \\n\\nelaine: literally nothing. i sat in a chair and i stared. \\n\\njerry: wow. that really is nothing. \\n\\nelaine: i told ya. \\n\\nkramer: hey. \\n\\njerry: hey. \\n\\nelaine: hey. \\n\\njerry: what are you all dressed up for? \\n\\nkramer: oh i ah just came from a meeting with my lawyer. \\n\\njerry: oh yeah, how\\'s that looking? \\n\\nkramer: oh i\\'ll tell you how it\\'s looking. my lawyer jackie says if there is one coffee drinker on that jury, (in a very high voice) i\\'m gonna be a rich man. \\n\\nelaine: that\\'s despicable. how does he know how all coffee drinkers will vote? i\\'m a coffee drinker. if i was on that jury i wouldn\\'t give you a nickel kramer. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, well you wouldn\\'t be on that jury. he would have weeded you out. \\n\\njerry: frankly i\\'m surprised you\\'re so litigious. \\n\\nkramer: oh i can be quite litigious. \\n\\nelaine: what i mean who ever heard of this anyway? suing a company because there coffee is too hot? coffee is supposed to be hot. \\n\\nkramer: yeah but jackie says the top was faulty. \\n\\nelaine: (mocking) jackie says the top was faulty. \\n\\nkramer: hey maestro! \\n\\nmaestro: ah, kramer. \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m in here. how\\'s it going. \\n\\nmaestro: fine. \\n\\njerry: hi bob. \\n\\njerry: (apologetically) oh, i\\'m sorry. maestro. \\n\\nkramer: well, this is a surprise ha? \\n\\nmaestro: i just wanted to drop off this chinese balm for your burns. it\\'s supposed to be great stuff. it\\'s all herbal. \\n\\nkramer: oh maestro, you, what are you doing? you don\\'t have to do this. do you believe this maestro? \\n\\nmaestro: it\\'s nothing. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, ya know you haven\\'t been around for a while. \\n\\nmaestro: oh yeah, i\\'ve been at my house in tuscany. \\n\\nkramer: oh tuscany huh? hear that jerry? that\\'s in italy. \\n\\njerry: i hear it\\'s ah beautiful there. \\n\\nmaestro: well if you\\'re thinking of getting a place there don\\'t bother. there\\'s really nothing available. \\n\\njerry: (surprised) huh? \\n\\nmaestro: (seeing elaine) oh! \\n\\nelaine: hello. \\n\\nmaestro: well hello. and who might you be? \\n\\nelaine: i might be elaine. \\n\\njerry: this is a, bob cobb. \\n\\nkramer: maestro. \\n\\nelaine: oh, maestro. \\n\\nmaestro: it is my very great pleasure.

(he moves to the end of the booth) here, watch. (stands up) criminals. boom. i\\'m up. (pretends he\\'s shooting) stop it! stop it! stop it! \\n\\njerry: maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down. \\n\\ngeorge: would you get out of here. who\\'s gonna turn down a chair? i would be very interested to know how he felt about all of this. maybe i\\'ll have a talk with him. \\n\\njerry: i know you will. \\n\\nkramer: hey, hey, hey, listen to this. jackie just called. \\n\\ngeorge: who? \\n\\njerry: his lawyer. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, java world wants to settle. \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, i\\'m gonna be rich. \\n\\njerry: why are they settling? \\n\\nkramer: cause their afraid of bad publicity. \\n\\njerry: all this because you spilled coffee on yourself? \\n\\nkramer: yeah that\\'s right. \\n\\ngeorge: (very loud in the direction of a waiter) i\\'m gonna need a coffee here. very hot! boiling! \\n\\n[setting: restaurant. maestro and elaine are talking) \\n\\nmaestro: and then about four years ago i was on holiday in tuscany. \\n\\nelaine: uh ha. \\n\\nmaestro: and i fell in love with this house. \\n\\nwaiter: are you ready to order? \\n\\nelaine: oh god. what are you getting bob? \\n\\nmaestro: good question. (to waiter) we\\'ll need a few minutes. \\n\\nmaestro: you know, i\\'m sorry but, i didn\\'t mention it earlier but actually i preferred to be called maestro. \\n\\nelaine: excuse me? \\n\\nmaestro: well, ya know i am a conductor. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, so? \\n\\nmaestro: oh i suppose it\\'s o.k. for leonard burnstein to be called maestro because he conducted the new york philharmonic. so he gets to be called maestro and i don\\'t. \\n\\nelaine: well, i mean don\\'t you think that he was probably called maestro while he was conducting, not in social situations. i mean his friends probably just called him lenny. \\n\\nmaestro: i happen to know for a fact, that he was called maestro in social situations. i once saw him at a bar and someone came up to him and said \"hello maestro, how about a beer\". o.k. so that\\'s a fact. \\n\\nelaine: maestro huh? o.k.

[inhaling deeply] jambalaya! \\n\\nsoup nazi: all right, now listen to me. you have been a good friend. i have an armoire in my basement. if you want to pick it up, you\\'re welcome to it. so, take it, it\\'s yours. \\n\\nkramer: how can i possibly thank you? \\n\\nsoup nazi: you are the only one who understands me. \\n\\nkramer: you suffer for your soup. \\n\\nsoup nazi: yes. that is right. \\n\\nkramer: you demand perfection from yourself, from your soup. \\n\\nsoup nazi: how can i tolerate any less from my customer? \\n\\ncustomer: uh, gazpacho, por favor. \\n\\nsoup nazi: por favor? \\n\\ncustomer: um, i\\'m part spanish. \\n\\nsoup nazi: adios muchacho! \\n\\nkramer: git. \\n\\njerry: it was stupid of me. \\n\\nsheila: well, it was very insulting. \\n\\njerry: no. i know. i - i was really sort of half-kidding. \\n\\nsheila: well, behind every joke there\\'s some truth. \\n\\njerry: what about that bavarian cream pie joke i told you? there\\'s no truth to that. nobody with a terminal illness goes from the united states to europe for a piece of bavarian cream pie and then when they get there and they don\\'t have it he says \" aw, i\\'ll just have some coffee.\" there\\'s no truth to that. \\n\\nsheila: well, i guess you\\'re right. \\n\\njerry: so, am i forgiven, shmoopy? \\n\\nsheila: yes, shmoopy. \\n\\njerry: aw! \\n\\nsusan: hey, jerry! \\n\\njerry: oh, hi susan, george. you remember sheila. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, yes. hello. \\n\\nsheila: hello. won\\'t you join us? \\n\\ngeorge: no, thanks. \\n\\nsusan: of course. \\n\\ngeorge: yes. well -- so, uh, sit on the same side at a booth, huh? \\n\\njerry: yeah. that\\'s right. you got a problem? \\n\\ngeorge: i, uh, just think it\\'s a little unusual. two people to sit on one side...and leave the other side empty. \\n\\njerry: well, we\\'re changing the rules. \\n\\ngeorge: ahh. good for you. \\n\\nsusan: aw, what are you getting george? \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t know, honey. what do you want to get?

[gasps] you know what this is? this is a recipe for soup, and look at this. there are like thirty different recipes. these are his recipes! \\n\\njery: so? \\n\\nelaine: so? so, his secret\\'s out. don\\'t you see? i could give these to every restaurant in town. i could have \\'em published! i could - i could drop fliers from a plane above the city. \\n\\njerry: wait a second, elaine. where do you think you\\'re going? \\n\\nelaine: what do you care? \\n\\njerry: elaine, i don\\'t want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand. i happen to love that soup. \\n\\nelaine: get out of my way, jerry. \\n\\njerry: elaine, let the man make his soup! \\n\\nelaine: don\\'t make me hurt you, jerry. \\n\\nsusan: look, they have it in blue...for my baby bluey. are you my baby bluey?

\\n\\njerry: yeah. too bad, \\'cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. i think it\\'s great that you\\'re so open with your affections in public. see, we had that. \\n\\nsusan: mmm-hmm. \\n\\ngeorge: you did? \\n\\njerry: oh, yeah. but the mental thing. but anyway. i\\'ll see ya. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. see ya. \\n\\nsoup nazi: go on! leave! get out! \\n\\nwoman: but i didn\\'t do anything. \\n\\nsoup nazi: next! \\n\\nelaine: hello. \\n\\nsoup nazi: you. you think you can get soup?

(jumps as his burns his fingers) twelve extra minutes, full wide-screen cinemascope, and if you come to the one o\\'clock show, you can hear geoffrey har-harwood. \\n\\njerry: geoffrey who? \\n\\nkramer: har-harwood, jerry. he was the assistant wardrobe man on spartacus. some fascinating insights into the production. \\n\\ngeorge: why would i spend seven dollars to see a movie that i could watch on tv? \\n\\nkramer: well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something in the microwave? why go to the park and fly a kite, when you can just pop a pill? (looks around monk\\'s) listen, you guys haven\\'t seen lloyd braun, have you? i\\'m supposed to meet him here. \\n\\ngeorge: lloyd braun? what d\\'you have to meet him for? \\n\\nkramer: well, he\\'s using his connections in the mayor\\'s office, to uh, get the theatre landmark status. \\n\\njerry: i thought he screwed up the dinkins campaign. \\n\\nkramer: well, he did. you know, after that, he had a nervous breakdown? had to spend a few months in an institution. \\n\\ngeorge: really? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, but he\\'s doing a lot better now. i\\'ve taken him under my wing. \\n\\njerry: oh, then i\\'m not worried. \\n\\nkramer: but he still needs all of our support. now, when he gets here treat him like he\\'s one of the gang, huh. \\n\\ngeorge: (thoughtful) breakdown, huh? \\n\\nlloyd: hey kramer. \\n\\nkramer: oh, hey lloyd, hey buddy.

(he takes pieces for himself and jerry) \\n\\nlloyd: george? \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t chew gum. \\n\\njerry: (chewing) mmm, different. where\\'d you get it? \\n\\nlloyd: friend of mine in chinatown gave it to me. if you want i can ask him where he got it. \\n\\njerry: nah, don\\'t bother. \\n\\nlloyd: no, it\\'s no problem. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t want it. \\n\\nkramer: jerry, jerry. lloyd says it\\'s no problem. he\\'s capable of locating the gum. \\n\\njerry: alright. \\n\\nkramer: mmm, delicious. this is delicious. mmm. \\n\\ngeorge: you know what? i think this ruthie cohen gave me the wrong change. didn\\'t i pay with a twenty? i\\'m sure i paid with a twenty. \\n\\nelaine: hey. \\n\\ngeorge: hey. \\n\\njerry: i think i finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. it\\'s a little lo-mein-y. (he spits it into the waste bin) \\n\\nelaine: what kind is that? \\n\\njerry: it\\'s chinese gum, lloyd braun gave me. \\n\\nelaine: lloyd braun? how\\'s he doing? \\n\\ngeorge: (almost gleeful) after dinkins lost the election, he had a complete nervous breakdown. they had to lock him up. \\n\\nelaine: you know, that\\'s around the same time i broke up with lloyd. y... you don\\'t think that i had anything to do with his breakdown, do you? \\n\\njerry: you know, i remember when we parted company, i was babbling incoherently for months. \\n\\nelaine: yeah? well, i got news for you. \\n\\ngeorge: the whole time that i was growing up, all i ever heard from my mother was \\'why can\\'t you be more like that lloyd braun?\\' \\n\\njerry: and in the end lloyd braun became more like you. \\n\\ngeorge: right, gotta get going. \\n\\njerry: aren\\'t you coming with us to spartacus? \\n\\ngeorge: nah, i gotta deliver some christmas presents to my parents. \\n\\njerry: i thought your parents were outta town? \\n\\ngeorge: why d\\'you think i\\'m going now? \\n\\n[street: queens] \\n\\npop: georgie! \\n\\ngeorge: hey, mr lazzari. \\n\\npop: back in the old neighborhood, ah? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, yeah. just delivering some presents to my folks. \\n\\npop: oh, snazzy car. le baron? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, eighty-three. used to belong to john voight. \\n\\npop: the actor, right? \\n\\ngeorge: something like that. \\n\\npop: mind if i look under the hood? \\n\\ngeorge: oh, no no no no. go ahead, pop, you always knew your cars. \\n\\npop: oh, deena! deena, deena, l... look who\\'s here. \\n\\ndeena: george costanza, is that you? \\n\\ngeorge: hey deena, come on, give us a hug.

(to elaine) and you should say hello to him, elaine. \\n\\nelaine: (concerned) what? lloyd is here? \\n\\nelaine: what? no, no, i\\'d rather... \\n\\nlloyd: hi elaine. \\n\\nelaine: (big fake smile) lloyd, yes. hello. \\n\\nlloyd: kramer tell you? we reserved some special seats, so we can all sit together. \\n\\nelaine: (reluctant) oh, well... i, uh, actually lloyd, jerry and i have to sit in the front row, uhm, (desperately inventing) because uh, because, because he, he forgot his glasses. so uh, thanks for getting us... uhm, we\\'ll see you afterwards. \\n\\nlloyd: that was odd. am i crazy, or does jerry not wear glasses? \\n\\nkramer: (emphatic) you\\'re not crazy. jerry does wear glasses. he just forgot \\'em, that\\'s all. (puts an arm round lloyd\\'s shoulder) not crazy. \\n\\n[alex theatre: auditorium] \\n\\njerry: we\\'re all the way in the front row. why couldn\\'t we sit in the special seats? \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m sorry, but i didn\\'t want lloyd thinking i was leading him on again. seeing him made me feel very uncomfortable. \\n\\njerry: nah, you don\\'t wanna be uncomfortable. \\n\\n[street: queens] \\n\\ndeena: poor lloyd. \\n\\ngeorge: i know. completely bonkers! \\n\\ndeena: sorry i can\\'t be so flip about this kind of thing. you know, after what happened to pop. \\n\\ngeorge: pop? what happened to pop? \\n\\ndeena: i thought you heard. he had a nervous breakdown last year. that\\'s why i\\'m taking care of him. \\n\\npop: oh, i tell you, they don\\'t build \\'em like this any more. \\n\\ngeorge: (a little worried) he uh, he doesn\\'t have the auto shop any more? \\n\\ndeena: uhn, it was too much for him. \\n\\ngeorge: (very worried) uhm, i, i gotta go. \\n\\ndeena: what? \\n\\ngeorge: i just remembered, i gotta be someplace. yuh-hu-hur, that\\'s enough. pop. pop, put down the wrench, pop. \\n\\n[alex theatre: auditorium] \\n\\ngeorge: pop! pop!! \\n\\n[alex theatre: lobby] \\n\\nlloyd: \\'s a great movie, huh? \\n\\nkramer: yeah. \\n\\nlloyd: sorry you forgot those glasses. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know what i was thinking. \\n\\nlloyd: how\\'d you like that gum? \\n\\njerry: (noncommittal) errh. \\n\\nkramer: (slapping jerry on the back) ah, he loved it. \\n\\nelaine: hey kramer, you know what? there, there isn\\'t a light there, in the ladies\\' room. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, yeah. it\\'s being repaired. \\n\\nelaine: oh. oh god. \\n\\nlloyd: you alright? \\n\\nelaine: ah, i sat too close to the screen. oh. i just gotta stretch out in a hot bath. it was nice to see you again, lloyd. \\n\\nelaine: officer. officer, is there some reason this man has to always be using a hose? i mean, he\\'s flooding the sidewalk. it\\'s a waste of water. couldn\\'t he just use a broom? \\n\\ncop: lady, you sold me.

(grins, snorts) it\\'s understandable. \\n\\ndeena: i\\'m glad you feel that way. because since my father\\'s breakdown i uh, become very sensitive to the warning signs. \\n\\ngeorge: warning signs? \\n\\ndeena: nervousness, irritability, paranoia. \\n\\ngeorge: (disbelief) what? (laugh) wh... what\\'re you talking about? i\\'m not the one with the problem. (defensive) lloyd braun was in the nuthouse, not me. \\n\\ndeena: yet again, taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others. \\n\\ngeorge: all my friends do that. \\n\\ndeena: george, i\\'m only trying to help... \\n\\ndeena: i\\'m... i\\'m concerned. george? george, are you listening to me? \\n\\ngeorge: you see that woman on the horse? (points) \\n\\ngeorge: she stole twenty dollars from me.

\\n\\ngeorge: why don\\'t we talk about it another time. \\n\\nfrank: but you see my point here? you only hear of a hen, a rooster and a chicken. something\\'s missing! \\n\\nmrs. ross: something\\'s missing all right. \\n\\nmr. ross: they\\'re all chickens. the rooster has sex with all of them. \\n\\nfrank: that\\'s perverse. \\n\\ngeorge: did anybody see firestorm? \\n\\nmr. ross: firestorm, that\\'s a hell of a picture. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. \\n\\nmr. ross: remember when they had the helicopter land on top of that car -- \\n\\nfrank: hey! hey! come on! come on! i haven\\'t seen it yet. \\n\\nmr. ross: it doesn\\'t have anything to do with the plot! \\n\\nfrank: still! still! i like to go in fresh! \\n\\ngeorge: oh mother of god. \\n\\nkramer: of course, uh, this is central park. uh, this was designed in 1850 by joe peppitone. um, built during the civil war so the northern armies could practice fighting on...on grass. oh, yeah. giddyup. on rusty! \\n\\njohn: thank you. now, i\\'d like to play something th -- well, actually, it\\'s my latest so it\\'s nice and fresh. it\\'s called \" hot and heavy.\" \\n\\ngeorge: thank god that\\'s over. \\n\\nestelle: the mother seems to hit the sauce pretty hard. i didn\\'t like that. \\n\\nfrank: and who doesn\\'t serve cake after a meal?

the marble rye? \\n\\nmrs. ross: oh, dear. i forgot to put out that - that bread they brought. \\n\\nestelle: we forgot to bring it in. \\n\\nfrank: no, i brought it in. they never put it out. \\n\\nmrs. ross: where is it? \\n\\nsusan: i don\\'t know. where\\'d you put it? \\n\\nmrs. ross: right over there. \\n\\nsusan: well, it\\'s gone. \\n\\ngeorge: you stole the bread? \\n\\nfrank: what do you mean stole? it\\'s my bread. they didn\\'t eat it. why should i leave it there? \\n\\ngeorge: because we brought it for them! \\n\\nfrank: apparently, it wasn\\'t good enough for them to serve. \\n\\nmrs. ross: is it possible they took it back? \\n\\nsusan: who would bring a bread and take it back? \\n\\nmr. ross: those people, that\\'s who. i think they\\'re sick. \\n\\nestelle: people take buses to get that rye. \\n\\ngeorge: maybe they forgot to put it out! \\n\\nfrank: aw, they didn\\'t forget to put it out! it\\'s deliberate! deliberate, i tell ya! \\n\\njerry: he stole back the rye? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. \\n\\njerry: why? \\n\\ngeorge: why? why? \\'cause he\\'s off his rocker! that\\'s why. \\n\\njerry: so, do the ross\\'s know? \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t know. they\\'re all very suspicious. \\n\\njerry: why wouldn\\'t they be? a rye bread doesn\\'t just disappear. \\n\\ngeorge: now, because of that stupid rye bread, i gotta keep them all separated for the rest of my life. \\n\\njerry: bad situation. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'ll tell you what i\\'d like to do. i\\'d like to replace that rye. \\n\\njerry: what do you mean replace it? \\n\\ngeorge: you know, you go out, you get another rye. of course, it would have to be the same one from schnitzer\\'s. you put it in the kitchen somewhere and you say ohh! there it is. \\n\\njerry: well, there ya go. what\\'s so hard about that? \\n\\ngeorge: what\\'s so hard about that? how am i supposed to get it in there? i can\\'t just walk in with it. i have to get the rosses out of the apartment! \\n\\njerry: all right. all right. don\\'t panic. let\\'s just think about it. get the ross\\'s out of the apartment. that can\\'t be so hard. wait a minute. wait a second. wait a second! you know, kramer\\'s been driving that hansom cab. \\n\\ngeorge: so?

(he writes) \"one cupcake.\" and then i put it in the bowl. (he tears off the sheet, crumples it and drops it into the bowl) there. very simple. \\n\\njerry: sort of a mooching inventory. \\n\\nkramer: no, no. not mooching. \\'cos at the end of the week, you add \\'em all up, and you give me the bill. \\n\\njerry: alright. \\n\\nkramer: alright, now look i gotta run some errands, so look. when elaine comes by with that bike, you hang onto it for me, alright? \\n\\njerry: kramer, i don\\'t know if you\\'re getting that bike. \\n\\nkramer: yes i am. we had a verbal contract. if we can\\'t take each other at our word, all is lost. \\n\\nkramer: (waving at the bowl) oh yeah, yeah. put that on my tab. \\n\\njerry: well this is it. the food is atrocious, but the busboys are the best in the city. \\n\\nmaitre d\\': may i take your coat, miss? \\n\\nchristie: yes, thank you. \\n\\ngeorge: the same outfit? \\n\\njerry: the exact same outfit. \\n\\ngeorge: how many days was it between encounters. \\n\\njerry: three. \\n\\ngeorge: three days. well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new wash cycle. you know, she did laundry the day after she met you, everything got clean and she started all over again. \\n\\njerry: possibly, but then shouldn\\'t the outfit only reappear again at the end of the cycle? \\n\\ngeorge: maybe she moved it up in the rotation. \\n\\njerry: why? it\\'s our first date, she\\'s already in reruns? \\n\\ngeorge: very curious. \\n\\njerry: indeed. \\n\\ngeorge: you know, einstein wore the exact same outfit every day. \\n\\njerry: well, if she splits the atom, i\\'ll let it slide. \\n\\ngeorge: (picking up his coat) awright, i\\'m heading home. \\n\\njerry: hey, did susan change her mind about the name? \\n\\ngeorge: (standing) not yet, but she\\'s weakening. \\n\\njerry: you know, george, just because your life is destroyed, don\\'t destroy someone else\\'s. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s mickey mantle, jerry. my idol. \\n\\njerry: how about \\'mickey\\'? \\n\\ngeorge: \\'mickey\\'?

(pointedly) so, how\\'s the neck? nice and loose? \\n\\nelaine: lookit, kramer, you are not getting this bike. i don\\'t even know why you ant it. (laughingly) i mean, it\\'s a girl\\'s bike. \\n\\nkramer: (deadly serious) it\\'s a verbal contract. we had a deal. \\n\\nelaine: no we didn\\'t. you take these things too literally. it\\'s like saying, you\\'re hungry enough to eat a horse. \\n\\nkramer: well, my friend jay reimenschneider eats horse all the time. he gets it from his butcher. \\n\\nelaine: this is not the point. (emphatic) the point is, you just can\\'t have the bike. \\n\\nkramer: boy, i am really surprised at you. (opening the door) you are the last person i figured would do something like this. i mean, george, yeah, i can see that. even jerry. but not you, elaine... \\n\\nkramer: i always put you up here... \\n\\nkramer: ...they\\'re over here. now you\\'re... aww-whawww. \\n\\nelaine: (grudging) alright. \\n\\nkramer: (points) digidi. \\n\\ngeorge: aw c\\'mon. it\\'s a fantastic name. it\\'s a real original, nobody else is gonna have it and i absolutely love it. \\n\\nsusan: well, i dunno how original it\\'s gonna be any more. \\n\\ngeorge: why not? \\n\\nsusan: well i was telling carrie about our argument, and when i told them the name, they just loved it. \\n\\ngeorge: so, what\\'re you saying? \\n\\nsusan: they\\'re gonna name their baby seven. \\n\\ngeorge: (disbelief) what?! they\\'re stealing the name?! that\\'s my name, i made it up! \\n\\nsusan: i can\\'t believe that they\\'re using it. \\n\\ngeorge: (anger) well now it\\'s not gonna be original! it\\'s gonna lose all its cachet! \\n\\nsusan: i dunno how much cachet it had to begin with. \\n\\ngeorge: (rage) oh, it\\'s got cachet, baby! it\\'s got cachet up the yin-yang! \\n\\nelaine: (in pain) oh god! oh, god. (bitter) kramer! \\n\\nman: watch your step. \\n\\nelaine: (pain) oh, ah.

(sarcasm) i would think kramer would have a knack for moving pieces of a person\\'s spine around. \\n\\nelaine: hey, you know what, i think i ran into that girl from the antique store. what\\'s her name, christie? \\n\\njerry: you saw her? what was she wearing? \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t know. i couldn\\'t see. i couldn\\'t look down because of my neck. \\n\\njerry: didn\\'t you get a glimpse? an impression? \\n\\nelaine: what d\\'you care? \\n\\njerry: both times i\\'ve seen her she\\'s worn the same dress. \\n\\nelaine: did you have a nice ride? \\n\\nkramer: oh, great ride. \\n\\nelaine: oh, that\\'s good. \\'cos it was your last! \\n\\nkramer: what\\'re you talking about?! we had a deal! \\n\\nelaine: (anger) you better give me back that bike! (indicating neck) look at this! look! ow. i couldn\\'t even crawl out of bed this morning. \\n\\nkramer: bed? you should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a week. \\n\\nelaine: what? you never told me that. \\n\\nkramer: well, it\\'s common sense. \\n\\nelaine: jerry, what is he talking about? he\\'s being ridiculous. \\n\\nkramer: alright, look. jerry, you know the whole story, you should settle this. \\n\\nelaine: yeah jerry. \\n\\njerry: well, i\\'m flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but unfortunately, my friendship to each of you precludes my getting involved. what you need is an impartial mediator. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, i\\'d go for that. would you go for that? \\n\\nkramer: alright, i\\'m down. \\n\\njerry: course, it would have to be someone who hasn\\'t heard the story before. someone who is unencumbered by any emotional attachment. someone whose heart is so dark, it cannot be swayed by pity, compassion, or human emotion of any kind. \\n\\nelaine: so, that\\'s the situation. \\n\\nnewman: mmm. you present an interesting dilemma. each of you seemingly has a legitimate claim to the bicycle, and yet the bicycle can have only one rightful owner. quite the conundrum. as a federal employee, i believe the law is all we have. (getting worked up) it\\'s all that separates us from the savages who don\\'t deserve even the privilege of the daily mail. (angry) stuffing parcels into mailboxes where they don\\'t belong!!... \\n\\nkramer: newman! \\n\\nnewman: ...but, you must promise that you will abide by my decision, no matter how unjust it may seem to either of you. do i have your word? \\n\\nkramer: uh, yeah. \\n\\nelaine: yeah. \\n\\nnewman: alright, let\\'s begin. \\n\\nnewman: (excited) ooh, my cocoa! \\n\\nken: why can\\'t we use seven? \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s my name. i made it up. you can\\'t just steal it. \\n\\ncarrie: well, it\\'s not as if susan\\'s pregnant. you\\'ve already postponed the wedding. who knows if you\\'ll ever get married. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, hey hey. don\\'t worry about me. i\\'m not a waffler. i don\\'t waffle! \\n\\nken: right, we\\'re both big mickey mantle fans, and we love the name. it\\'s very unusual. \\n\\ngeorge: (shouting) what happened to soda?! i thought we all agreed on soda. \\n\\nken: (emphatic) well, we don\\'t care for soda. \\n\\ngeorge: you don\\'t care for soda?! \\n\\ncarrie: (worked up) no, no. we don\\'t like soda at all! \\n\\ngeorge: (shouting) how d\\'you not like soda?! it\\'s bubbly, it\\'s refreshing! \\n\\ncarrie: oh! \\n\\nken: what is it? \\n\\ncarrie: i felt something. \\n\\nken: are you okay, honey? \\n\\ncarrie: i think i\\'m going into labour. \\n\\nken: oh god, oh god. okay, let\\'s not panic. let\\'s just get to the hospital... \\n\\ncarrie: okay. \\n\\nken: ...alright? i got the suitcase packed, right here. \\n\\ngeorge: what about six? \\n\\ngeorge: nine. thirt... thirteen\\'s no good. \\n\\ngeorge: fourteen. (shouting after ken) fourteen! \\n\\nchristie: are you okay, jerry? you seem quiet. \\n\\njerry: no, i\\'m just a little uh, worn out. \\n\\nchristie: i know exactly what you mean. \\n\\njerry: oh, i\\'m sure you do. \\n\\njerry (v.o.): what in god\\'s name is going on here? is she wearing the same thing over and over again? or does she have a closet full of these, like superman? i\\'ve got to unlock this mystery. \\n\\nchristie: (horrified) oh my god! \\n\\njerry: oh. \\n\\nchristie: ahh. i can\\'t go to the movies like this. do you mind if we go back to my apartment, so i can change? \\n\\njerry: change? (thoughtful) yes, i think that\\'s a super idea. \\n\\ncarrie: are we almost there? \\n\\nken: just keep breathing, okay. \\n\\ncarrie: (deep breaths) okay, okay. \\n\\nken: okay. \\n\\ngeorge: (to carrie) you know, the thing is, i kinda promised the widow mantle that i would name my baby seven. \\n\\nken: now\\'s not the best time, george! \\n\\ngeorge: (to carrie) it\\'s just that, i know her, and boy... \\n\\nken: (firm) george! she\\'s in labour! \\n\\ngeorge: (angry shout) so am i! \\n\\nnewman: well, you\\'ve both presented very convincing arguments. on the one hand, elaine, your promise was given in haste. but was it not still a promise? hmm? \\n\\nnewman: and, kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for compensation. but, does the fee, once paid, not entitle the buyer to some assurance of reliability? hmm? huh? ahh. these were not easy questions to answer. not for any man... \\n\\nnewman: ...but i have made a decision. (revelatory) we will cut the bike down the middle, and give half to each of you. \\n\\nelaine: (shout) what?! this is your solution?! to ruin the bike?! \\n\\nelaine: alright, fine. fine. go ahead. (standing) cut the stupid thing in half. \\n\\nkramer: no, no, no. give it to her. i\\'d rather it belonged to another than see it destroyed. newman, give it to her, i beg you. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, yeah, y-yeah. \\n\\nnewman: not so fast, elaine! only the bike\\'s true owner would rather give it away than see it come to harm. kramer, the bike is yours! \\n\\nelaine: what?! \\n\\nkramer: sweet justice. newman, you are wise. \\n\\nelaine: (frustration) but this isn\\'t fair! lookit, my neck is still hurting me, and now you have the bike?! \\n\\nkramer: well, tell it to the judge, honey. i\\'m going for a ride. \\n\\nchristie: here we are. \\n\\njerry: (looking around) ah, so this is the fortress of solitude. \\n\\nchristie: well, i guess i\\'ll go change. \\n\\njerry: yes, change. by all means, change. \\n\\njerry (v.o.): august seventeen, nineteen-ninety-two. the same dress! she never changes! oh my god. (looking around) she\\'s gotta have hundreds of these dresses. \\n\\njerry (v.o.): there must be a secret stash around here somewhere. \\n\\nchristie: ahem! are you looking for something? \\n\\njerry: what\\'re you doing? i thought you were changing. \\n\\nchristie: no, i, i\\'m thinking we should just call it a night. \\n\\njerry: no, no. c\\'mon, put something else on. it\\'s early, let\\'s go out. \\n\\nchristie: if it\\'s all the same to you, i think i\\'m just gonna go to bed. \\n\\njerry: you know, i\\'m kinda tired myself. maybe i\\'ll just sleep here on the couch. then in the morning, you\\'ll get dressed, we\\'ll walk out together. both dressed, different clothes. well, i\\'ll be in the same clothes. you\\'ll of course be in different clothes, because it\\'s your apartment. but we\\'ll go downstairs, me in my same clothes, you in your different clothes. \\n\\nchristie: (unequivocal) jerry. i don\\'t think so. \\n\\njerry: you wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab? \\n\\nchristie: (gesturing) get out. \\n\\njerry: (pleading) tell me what you\\'re wearing tomorrow. i\\'ll help you lay it out on the bed. \\n\\nken: okay, breathe, honey. breathe. \\n\\ngeorge: (to carrie) you know, you\\'re really being very selfish. it would be nice if you would think of someone other than yourself every now and then! \\n\\ncarrie: (shouts) i\\'m having a baby!! \\n\\nken: george, you\\'re not getting seven! now get outta here!! \\n\\ngeorge: (desperate) please! i have so little! \\n\\norderly: sorry sir, it\\'s family only. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m family. i\\'m having sex with the cousin! \\n\\ngeorge: seven!! \\n\\njerry: hello, christie? i was wondering if we could get together again?

(elaine nods) did he look like me? did you talk to him? \\n\\nelaine: i didn\\'t talk to anyone - i was just walking by, and i saw the sign, and i thought george might get a kick out of it. \\n\\nfrank: i gotta get that picture - it could be my cousin, carlo. \\n\\nelaine: who is that? \\n\\ngeorge: (muttering out, not really wanting to talk about his family) when the costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind. \\n\\nfrank: i played with him every day until the age of four - and then we separated. \\n\\nelaine: so, you weren\\'t born here? \\n\\nfrank: no. that\\'s why i can never be president.. it always irked me. that\\'s why, even at an early age, i had no interest in politics. i refuse to vote. (yelling out) they don\\'t want me, i don\\'t want them! \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t know what you\\'re getting all riled up about. there are probably a million costanzas- \\n\\nfrank: (cutting him off) don\\'t bring me down. (to elaine) do you have another copy of that photo? \\n\\nelaine: no, i, i don\\'t. but.. well, the maestro might. \\n\\nfrank: the maestro? what maestro? \\n\\nelaine: he\\'s this guy that i went to tuscany with. he\\'s a great guy, but i just wouldn\\'t feel comfortable calling him. \\n\\ngeorge: really? why? \\n\\nelaine: (explaining) because he hasn\\'t called me since we got back.. i spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite italian opera stars. \\n\\ngeorge: who? \\n\\nelaine: you know the three tenors? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah.. (trying to remember) poverotti.. domingo.. and.. uh.. the other guy. \\n\\nelaine: (nodding) the other guy. \\n\\n[setting: airplane] \\n\\nstewardess: (overly nice) could i take that box for you? \\n\\njerry: uh.. well, you better not. i\\'m supposed to be careful with it. \\n\\nstewardess: oh, then, i\\'ll have to put your bag in the over-head. \\n\\njerry: oh, okay.. \\n\\nstewardess: there we go. \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\njerry: ohh.. look at this.. \\n\\nkramer: what? \\n\\njerry: i bought a bottle of bbq sauce in memphis. i think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this \\n\\nkramer: well, don\\'t press the panic button. i\\'m sure that we can still salvage some sauce.. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t care about the sauce. it came in this funny little bottle, and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like charles grodin. \\n\\nkramer: (taking some of jerry\\'s clothing over to the kitchen) i see.. \\n\\njerry: no, you don\\'t see - because i\\'m going on the show this week, and this was going to be my bit on the show. \\n\\nkramer: well, why don\\'t you do your material? \\n\\njerry: i\\'m out. \\n\\nkramer: (looking up, sighs) well, you better get to work. \\n\\njerry: (sarcastic) thanks for the tip. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, buddies. \\n\\njerry: hey. hey, this is for you. (taps the gift) it\\'s from.. uh, susan\\'s roommate, sally. \\n\\ngeorge: oh yeah.. (starts to open it) sally called susan - said you guys really hit it off. \\n\\njerry: (annoyed at the thought) nobody hit anything off. she just gave me the box. (looks over at kramer. he is scraping the bbq sauce off jerry\\'s clothes with a knife, then dipping some bread into it) what the hell are you doing? \\n\\nkramer: (looks up) i\\'m salvaging the sauce. what\\'s the matter with you? (eats the bread) \\n\\njerry: (pleading) hey, hey, hey. come on, come on. \\n\\nkramer: (moving out into the living room) jerry, why don\\'t you do a bit on styrofoam? \\n\\njerry: like what? \\n\\nkramer: well, uh.. (starts to impersonate jerry\\'s act) \"what is this stuff? why do we need this stuff?.. and why do they make it so small..?\" \\n\\njerry: (confused) where\\'s the punchline? \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s all attitude.. (makes a humorous face - mocking jerry\\'s) \\n\\ngoerge: (taking out a mat from the huge box) well, this is certainly a crappy gift.. \\n\\njerry: a door mat? that\\'s what she had me lug up from memphis?! \\n\\ngeorge: pretty chintzy, huh? considering the money she makes.. she\\'s a big executive for federal express. \\n\\njerry: federal express?! is she out of her mind? why didn\\'t she just ship it?! \\n\\nkramer: look, it\\'s personalized. (holds it up, reading) \"the costanzas\" \\n\\ngeorge: no, no. forget it. i don\\'t want it. let\\'s just get rid of it. \\n\\nkramer: well, maybe your father would be interested in that. \\n\\ngeorge: i doubt it. you know what he\\'s doing now? he\\'s putting a pool table in my old bedroom. \\n\\nkramer: (interested) oh yeah? well, maybe i\\'ll go out there and knock a few balls around with him. you know, show him a thing or two.. \\n\\n[setting: george\\'s old bedroom] \\n\\nkramer: so, what\\'s your game? what do you like to play? \\n\\nfrank: eight ball. \\n\\nkramer: no, nothing doing. let\\'s, you and me, play a game of straight pool.. hmm? \\n\\nfrank: you like to gamble, cosmo? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, now and then - you know how it is.. \\n\\nfrank: five dollars a game, huh? \\n\\nkramer: i\\'ll break. \\n\\nfrank: okay. \\n\\n[setting: george and susan\\'s apartment] \\n\\ngeorge: what\\'s all this? \\n\\nsusan: oh, i\\'m just moving in some more of my stuff. \\n\\ngeorge: (muttering to himself as he walks to the bedroom) more stuff.. \\n\\nsusan: (calling out) oh, i put up my doll collection.. \\n\\ngeorge: oh my god! what is that?! \\n\\nsusan: (rushing in) what? what is it? \\n\\ngeorge: (staring at the doll) this doll (pointing) looks like my mother. \\n\\nsusan: george, it\\'s a doll. \\n\\ngeorge: i know it\\'s a doll, but it looks like my mother! \\n\\nsusan: (going back to the living room) oh, get outta here.. \\n\\n[setting: george\\'s old bedroom] \\n\\nestelle: what\\'s going on in here? (kramer hits the cue ball, it jumps up from the table and flies off screen) are you two still playing?! you\\'ve been up here three hours! \\n\\nfrank: we still haven\\'t finished the first game. \\n\\nestelle: the first game?! \\n\\nkramer: (explaining why they are doing so bad) well, we\\'re still, uh, learning the subtleties of the table. \\n\\nfrank: (to estelle) he knows the maestro. he could have the picture.. \\n\\nestelle: oh, forget about it. it\\'s not your cousin. \\n\\nfrank: (yelling out) you don\\'t know that! (estelle leaves, slamming the door) we\\'re gonna go see him, huh? \\n\\nkramer: (judging up his next move) as soon as the game is over.. \\n\\nfrank: (sensing the game is going to last a long time) oh boy. \\n\\nkramer: eleven, corner pocket. (pulls back on his stick, accidentally crashing it into the window) \\n\\n[setting: george and susan\\'s bedroom] \\n\\ngeorge: what is this thing doing here? \\n\\nsusan: oh, i used to love to sleep with my dolls when i was a little girl.. \\n\\ngeorge: uh, i\\'m sorry, i can\\'t do this.. \\n\\nsusan: why? \\n\\ngeorge: i feel like i\\'m in bed with my mother. \\n\\nsusan: oh, stop it. \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\njerry: hey, elaine, you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush i just got - the ori-dent. \\n\\nelaine: (just making conversation) oh yeah? \\n\\njerry: oh, it\\'s unbelievable. every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist! \\n\\nelaine: (mock enthusiasm) oh, that\\'s dynamite. \\n\\njerry: hey, what are you doing tomorrow? you want to come see me on the charles grodin show? \\n\\nelaine: who else is on the show? \\n\\njerry: uh.. one of the three tenors. \\n\\nelaine: (interested) the three tenors? (stands up) which one?! \\n\\njerry: uh.. it\\'s not poverotti.. it\\'s not domingo.. \\n\\nelaine: (extremely excited) the other guy?! \\n\\njerry: (nodding) yeah, the other guy. \\n\\nelaine: (screams out in joy) my god! i can\\'t believe the other guy\\'s going to be on the show! \\n\\njerry: why? \\n\\nelaine: because i ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the maestro. you think i can go and get his autograph? \\n\\njerry: why not? \\n\\nelaine: (extremely giddy) wow! the other guy! \\n\\njerry: hey, you look awful. \\n\\ngeorge: (sitting on the sofa) i\\'m on no sleep, bro. \\n\\njerry: problem in the bedroom? \\n\\ngeorge: (muttering) susan has the doll collection.. one of the dolls looks exactly like my mother.. she likes to sleep with it. \\n\\njerry: wow. you were in bed with your mother last night? \\n\\ngeorge: (long pause) ..felt like it. i tell you, this doll is pretty spooky. (takes off his glasses, rubbing his eye) it\\'s freakin\\' me out man. and now i got to go back out there and pick up this doormat. \\n\\njerry: i thought you didn\\'t want the doormat. \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t. susan wants to have it out when sally comes tomorrow. \\n\\njerry: sally? (getting upset) wait, wait a minute - she\\'s coming to new york? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, (smiling) susan said you\\'d be excited. \\n\\njerry: excited? i\\'m gonna kill her! she knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box?! \\n\\nelaine: who\\'s sally? \\n\\ngeorge: susan\\'s college roommate. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s because of her that bottle got broke that i was going to give to charles grodin on his show. \\n\\ngeorge: so call her up and tell her to bring you another one. she\\'ll be delighted to talk to you. \\n\\njerry: (while opening a cereal box) i will - don\\'t worry. (plotting revenge) in fact, i\\'ll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. it\\'ll be really heavy. let\\'s see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap! \\n\\nelaine: that\\'s sounds pretty juvenile. \\n\\njerry: (pulling out the toy from the cereal box - he displays even more immaturity by holding it up, smiling) hey! a dinosaur! \\n\\n[setting: the maestro\\'s office] \\n\\nfrank: his name was carlo costanza. we played together everyday until i was four. if i could just look through your photographs, maybe i could recognize him. \\n\\nmaestro: unfortunately those photographs are at home. \\n\\nkramer: well, listen, if you bring \\'em by, maybe we could interest you in a game of pool.. yeah, frank here - he\\'s got his own billiard room. \\n\\nfrank: (trying to concentrate) yes, it\\'s, uh, it\\'s.. uh, uh.. what do you call it, kramer? \\n\\nkramer: a billiard room. \\n\\nfrank: no, not billiard.. (scolding) not billiards.. it was.. come on, already. come on.. \\n\\nkramer: (confused) what? \\n\\nfrank: we call it.. the, uh.. \\n\\nkramer: (snaps) the place to be! \\n\\nfrank: the place to be! yes! it\\'s the place to be. \\n\\nmaestro: (agreeing to a game) ah, then i shall be there. and now, gentlemen, (making dramatic actions) if you will excuse me - i must prepare for the symphony. \\n\\nkramer: oh, yeah? \\n\\nmaestro: (noticing the expressions) ohh, my pants. (begins putting on a near-by pair of pants) it\\'s an old conductor\\'s trick i learned from leonard bernstein. \\n\\nkramer: really? \\n\\nmaestro: you keep a perfect crease by not sitting in them before the performance. \\n\\nkramer: that\\'s good thinking. \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\ngeorge: you see?.. you see?! \\n\\njerry: well, it doesn\\'t look exactly like her. \\n\\ngeorge: jerry, come on. if my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she\\'s gonna look like in ten years! \\n\\njerry: why don\\'t you just get rid of it? \\n\\ngeorge: i tried! i almost threw it down the incinerator, but i couldn\\'t do it. the guilt was too overwhelming. (grabs the doll, opening the door to leave) susan\\'s so attached to this thing. \\n\\njerry: wait, where are you going? don\\'t take your dolly and go home. \\n\\ngeorge: hi, elaine. \\n\\nelaine: did you see that?! \\n\\njerry: i\\'m just glad it\\'s outta here. (elaine exhales deeply - getting over the scare of the doll. she moves into the apartment) what\\'s that? (pointing to a rolled up poster elaine is carrying) \\n\\nelaine: oh, it\\'s a poster of the three tenors. \\n\\njerry: oh. (intercom buzzes, jerry answers it) yeah? \\n\\nsally: (through the intercom) it\\'s sally. \\n\\njerry: oh, did you bring the bar-b-que sauce? \\n\\nsally: a whole case. \\n\\njerry: (letting her up) excellent. (to elaine) so, did you buy that electric toothbrush i was telling you about? \\n\\nelaine: (blunt, to the point) no. \\n\\njerry: how come? i told you - it\\'s fantastic. \\n\\nelaine: eh, i like mine. \\n\\njerry: i\\'ve had yours, i\\'m telling you - this one is ten times better. don\\'t you believe me? \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t want it. \\n\\njerry: (slightly confused by her behavior) i don\\'t understand this. why wouldn\\'t you want to get something that\\'s better if i\\'m telling you it\\'s better? and it\\'s not a little better - it\\'s much better. \\n\\nelaine: (not committing to the conversation) it doesn\\'t matter to me. \\n\\njerry: come in. \\n\\nsally: (peppy) well, here i am! \\n\\njerry: oh, hi. elaine, this is sally. \\n\\nelaine: hi. \\n\\njerry: how was your flight? (wishful thinking) pretty uncomfortable? \\n\\nsally: (setting the box down on his table) actually, the seat next to me was empty, so, there was no problem at all. \\n\\njerry: (let down) oh.. (starts to open the box) oh, wait.. (holding up one of the bbq jars) this isn\\'t the sauce that i asked for! \\n\\nsally: that\\'s right. it\\'s a special gourmet sauce. \"the pride of memphis!\" \\n\\njerry: (complaining) no, no. i wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like charles grodin! \\n\\nsally: this is much better. and frankly, in memphis, we think that other sauce as (whispering) kind of a joke. \\n\\njerry: i know it\\'s a joke. it\\'s supposed to be a joke! now i\\'m going on the charles grodin show with nothing. (sets the jar down angrily) nothing! \\n\\nsally: you could just do your material. \\n\\njerry: (peeved) i don\\'t have any material! \\n\\nelaine: (yelling out) he\\'s got nothin\\'! \\n\\n[setting: the coffee shop] \\n\\ndoll: georgie! don\\'t eat with your hands! (george starts eating faster) why do you eat so fast?! you can\\'t even taste it! \\n\\ngeorge: (losing it) don\\'t tell me how to eat! \\n\\ndoll: you\\'re wearing that shirt? you\\'ve had it for five years already! why don\\'t you get a new shirt?! \\n\\ngeorge: (trying to keep it down) because i like this one! (notices people staring at him, he quickly gets up, collecting the his coat and the tiny replica) c\\'mon, let\\'s go. let\\'s go! (on his way out, he stops in front of a woman blocking his path) oh, hi.. (embarrassed about the doll, he sheepishly walks out) \\n\\nwoman: (to ruthie, the cashier) that man should really be in a sanitarium. (ruthie nods, agreeing) \\n\\n[setting: george\\'s old bedroom] \\n\\nkramer: now this is remarkable. i\\'m lounging, and yet, my pants remain perfectly creased. \\n\\nfrank: it\\'s him! (standing up) it\\'s carlo costanza! \\n\\nkramer: come on. are you sure? \\n\\nfrank: i\\'d know him anywhere. \\n\\nmaestro: i\\'ve seen that man in tuscany. eccentric fellow. reputation of being kind of a village idiot. \\n\\nfrank: i still say we\\'re related. \\n\\nmaestro: (recognizing the currently playing song) ohh, i love this piece. (turns it up, then pantomimes that he is conducting the instruments) \\n\\nkramer: alright, come on frank. it\\'s your shot. \\n\\nfrank: (complaining) i can\\'t make anything.. \\n\\nkramer: (like a professional) well, that\\'s because you don\\'t know how to follow through correctly. \\n\\nfrank: follow through? what do you mean? \\n\\nkramer: right here, come on, i\\'ll show you.. (gets behind frank, holding the pool stick with him) take hold of your stick.. alright, bring it back slowly.. \\n\\nfrank: it\\'s a little unnatural, but i think i\\'m getting the hang of it. \\n\\nestelle: oh, my god! \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\njerry: (still ticked off) that woman is such an idiot! i was gonna do this whole bit on that bottle - and now i got nothing to talk about. \\n\\nelaine: well, have you ever considered writing new material? \\n\\njerry: well, maybe if i didn\\'t have so many people in my apartment all the time i\\'d be able to get some work done. \\n\\nelaine: (getting the hint) me? are you talking about me? \\n\\njerry: (deeply sarcastic) no. you\\'re never here. \\n\\nelaine: (reflecting) boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn\\'t it? \\n\\njerry: yeah. really. (forming and idea) hey, you know what? maybe i could talk about that on the show. \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\njerry: show the doll - show the picture of george\\'s mother.. it\\'s pretty funny. (moving toward the phone) i\\'m gonna call them. \\n\\nsally: hello? \\n\\njerry: hello, susan? it\\'s jerry. \\n\\nsally: hi jerry, it\\'s sally! \\n\\njerry: (disappointed) oh. is george there? \\n\\nsally: no, but he should be home soon. \\n\\njerry: uh, listen, this is important. tell him to meet me at the tv studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her. \\n\\nsally: is this for your comedy routine? \\n\\njerry: (obviously resents talking to her) yes. \\n\\nsally: (gasps) don\\'t worry. (like a detective) i\\'m on the case. \\n\\n[setting: george\\'s old bedroom] \\n\\nmaestro: (sighs slightly) i, uh, think i\\'ll get some air. (slowly leaves) \\n\\nkramer: yeah.. (sizes up his next shot. his stick jams into the window as he draws back) see? this is no good.. (looks around the room. his sights fall on the maestro\\'s baton) hey, the baton. (chalks it up) i got a hunch, fat man, i can\\'t miss. (measures up his shot) 13 in the side pocket. (does just that) giddy-up. (moves around to the other side of the board, judging his next move) six in the corner. (hits it in) this table\\'s mine. (a series of kramer\\'s plays are displayed, and, on the last ball of the game..) you know where it\\'s going.. \\n\\n[setting: the charles grodin show dressing room] \\n\\nelaine and jerry: hey! \\n\\nelaine: is george here? \\n\\njerry: not yet. (points over to a man sitting in one of the room\\'s chairs. whispers) the other guy. \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s.. .. you! it\\'s really you! oh, i\\'m such a huge fan of yours. would you mind signing this poster for me? \\n\\ncarreras: my pleasure. (reaches for a pen as elaine unravels her poster) \\n\\nelaine: (as he is signing) oh, thank you so much. (he finishes. elaine gives out a happy gasp) thank you so much, mr.. (tries to read his signature) camaro. (carreras gives her a look as he is getting up) mr. casea? (he walks off as elaine rolls the picture back up. jerry gives his \"that\\'s a shame\" face) well, whatever. (to jerry) i\\'m gonna take this to the maestro. he\\'s, he\\'s playing at the queens convalescent center. \\n\\njerry: (joking around) well, that\\'s one hell of a gig. (turning around, he picks up a box labeled \"ori-dent\") hey, look, i got something for you. the ori-dent! \\n\\nelaine: (mock joy) ohh.. thank you. (accepts the gift) huh.. (struggles under the size) wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box? \\n\\njerry: well, it\\'s a delicate mechanism - it, you know, needs lots of packaging. \\n\\nelaine: (still trying to get a grasp on the package) how am i supposed to carry this thing? (she looks up to see jerry taking his pants off) what are you doing? \\n\\njerry: well, i want to sit down. \\n\\nelaine: so? \\n\\njerry: it\\'s a trick i just learned from kramer. it keeps a crease in the pants. (folds his pants over the head of a chair, then sits down in another. when he sees elaine\\'s staring at him, he makes a \"tada!\" gesture with his hands. elaine holds her hand up - as if to say \"i\\'ll see ya.\", and while she\\'s slowly walking out jerry gives her a salute) \\n\\n[setting: george\\'s old bedroom] \\n\\nmaestro: (making his exit, he lays the charm on mrs. costanza) madame, you have been an extremely gracious hostess. (kisses her hand) \\n\\nestelle: (coy) ohh.. thank you, maestro. (giggles to herself as the maestro leaves) \\n\\nfrank: (holding up a picture) here, take a look at this. \\n\\nestelle: (looking at it) yeah, what is it? \\n\\nfrank: it\\'s carlo. i found him! \\n\\nestelle: (handing the picture back) you\\'ve been cooped up in this room too long. \\n\\nfrank: (yelling out) you never support me! let\\'s see what george says about this.. where\\'re my pants? (takes his pair off a rack and leaves) \\n\\nkramer: (taking his pair off, he inspects them) aw, beautiful! \\n\\n[setting: the charles grodin show dressing room] \\n\\nsally: hey there, mr. hairy legs! \\n\\njerry: (surprised to see her, he gets up) where\\'s george? \\n\\nsally: don\\'t worry, i brought your doll.. (pulls out an extremely different doll - this one resembles a baker) tada! \\n\\njerry: (complaining) no! that\\'s the wrong doll! \\n\\nsally: jerry, i saw the doll you were talking about - not funny! this doll\\'s much funnier. look, it has a little bowtie, and a cute little hat.. i think it\\'s a riot! \\n\\njerry: (slow whispering) this is a nightmare. \\n\\nsally: oh well, i\\'ll be watching. (sets the doll down, then crosses her fingers) don\\'t screw up. (leaves) \\n\\njerry: my pants! \\n\\nstagehand: mr. seinfeld, you\\'re on. \\n\\n[setting: nyc street] \\n\\nmaestro: elaine? what a surprise. \\n\\nelaine: i know you\\'re very busy, but i just wanted to come by and give you this. \\n\\nmaestro: ohh.. (looking at the box) ori-dent - that electric toothbrush i\\'ve heard so much about.. \\n\\nelaine: no, no, no. not the toothbrush.. (holds out the poster) this. \\n\\nmaestro: ohh, what a sweet gesture. and autographed poster of my favorite tenor, with.. those two other guys. oh, elaine, this is magnifico! \\n\\nelaine: oh, well, i just felt so bad about what happened in tuscany.. \\n\\nstagehand: (yelling from off-camera) maestro, you\\'re on! \\n\\nmaestro: oh, elaine.. wait for me after the concert? we\\'ll celebrate. \\n\\nelaine: oh, ok! (picking up the ori-dent box, she knocks over a bottle of wine. it spills all over the poster) \\n\\n[setting: george and susan\\'s apartment] \\n\\nsusan: i want to know why you took my doll out of the house. \\n\\ngeorge: i just wanted a second opinion. \\n\\nfrank: (holding up the picture) take a look at this. doesn\\'t that look like my flesh and blood? of course, your mother- (his attention is drawn over to susan\\'s doll. like george did earlier, he starts to imagine that the doll is scolding him as his wife would) \\n\\ndoll: oh, stop bothering everybody with that picture. it\\'s ridiculous! \\n\\nfrank: (walking toward the doll) ridiculous?! i\\'ll show you ridiculous! (struggles with susan for possession of the doll) come here! \\n\\nsusan: (pleading) no, mr. costanza! no, no! \\n\\nfrank: (holding out the head in his hand, he addresses it) there! now what have you got to say for yourself?! \\n\\ngeorge: (to susan) i told you it looked like her.. \\n\\n[setting: a street in tuscany] \\n\\nfrank: (sets a gift he\\'s brought down) carlo! it\\'s me, frank! (attempts to hug the guy, but he resists - pushing frank away. he scolds frank in another language) i\\'m your cousin, frank! aren\\'t you carlo? \\n\\nman: carlo? no. mi nome e giuseppe. \\n\\nfrank: (realizing) what do you know.. alright. (picking up his present) i guess i was wrong. (walks off) \\n\\ngeorge: (joyful) june. it\\'s june. \\n\\ngeorge: (high-fiving) hey! \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s june.mark\\'s michelle is a dog. \\n\\ngeorge: june, june, june. \\n\\ngeorge: (to passerby) hey, he-hah. it\\'s june, june. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s juu-uu-une! hey hay. yes. \\n\\ngeorge: i love juu-uuu-uu-uune! \\n\\ngeorge: june. juune, baby! \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\ngeorge: the catering hall screwed up. the wedding is delayed until june. it\\'s like a stay of execution. \\n\\njerry: dead man walking. \\n\\ngeorge: (pointing to jerry in joyous agreement) ha-ha-hah. this is my lucky day. \\n\\njerry: well, one outta twenty thousand. that\\'s not bad. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. hey, wait a second, you know, good news for you too. susan\\'s best friend, hallie? broke up with her boyfriend. \\n\\njerry: she did? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. \\n\\njerry: so? wheels? \\n\\ngeorge: in motion. the wheels are in motion. \\n\\njerry: beautiful. \\n\\ngeorge: aah, hey. (enthusiastic) if this works out, forget about it. vacations together, movies together, dinner together. it..it\\'s almost as good as if i didn\\'t get married. \\n\\njerry: so, set it up. you know what, we could have dinner at the friars club. \\n\\ngeorge: the friars club? \\n\\njerry: yeah, i\\'m thinking of joining. pat cooper said he would put me up for membership. \\n\\nkramer: hey everybody. (to jerry) listen, uh, do me a favour, will you? i got a hot date tonight with connie. knock on my door, wake me up in twenty minutes, alright? \\n\\njerry: catnap? \\n\\nkramer: no, no, no, no.

\\n\\nteller: well if there was some problem with the garment. if it were unsatisfactory in some way, then we could do it for you, but i\\'m afraid spite doesn\\'t fit into any of our conditions for a refund \\n\\njerry: that\\'s ridiculous, i want to return it. what\\'s the difference what the reason is. \\n\\nteller: let me speak with the manager...excuse me .............bob! \\n\\nteller: ........spite.....(manager walks over) \\n\\nbob: what seems to be the problem?

(he grabs a suit jacket from the desk chair and puts it on) \\n\\nmrs. ross: we know the last three months have been hard on you. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, yes, yes, yes. very, very hard. \\n\\nmr. ross: and they\\'ve been hard on us, too. it\\'s a terrible tragedy when parents outlive their children. \\n\\ngeorge: yes, i agree. i hope my parents go long before i do. \\n\\nmr. ross: that\\'s why we decided to create a foundation to preserve susan\\'s memory. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, that\\'s wonderful. \\n\\nmr. ross: and, of course, we want you to be an integral part. \\n\\ngeorge: yes, inte-- h-how inte-- how integral? \\n\\nmr. ross: you\\'ll be on the board of directors. \\n\\ngeorge: (feigning excitement) great, great. o-oh, oh, oh, gosh. you know, it\\'s just... my duties with the yankees... \\n\\nmrs. ross: don\\'t worry, george. the foundation will revolve around your schedule. evenings, weekends, whenever you have free time. \\n\\ngeorge: i can\\'t believe this is happening. \\n\\nmr. ross: well, it wouldn\\'t have without your friend jerry\\'s inspirational words. he said to us, \"she\\'s not really dead if her shadow is...\" uh, w-what was it, dear? \\n\\nmrs. ross: something about a way, a-and a light, uh... ha. who the hell knows? \\n\\nmr. ross: well, what\\'s important is that your relationship with susan doesn\\'t have to end. \\n\\nmrs. ross: so will you be sure to thank jerry for us? \\n\\ngeorge: (feigning happiness) the second i see him. \\n\\njerry: hey. \\n\\ngeorge: hey. how\\'s your day, good? \\n\\njerry: actually, yeah. i\\'m meeting mulva here in a few minutes. \\n\\ngeorge: so uh... wrath of khan, huh? \\n\\njerry: yeah. was that a beauty or what? \\n\\ngeorge: what was that line again? something about finding your way in a shadow? \\n\\njerry: no, no, no, it\\'s... \"she\\'s not really dead if we find a way to remember her.\" \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s it. that\\'s the line... (squirts mustard into jerry\\'s coffee and stirs it) ...that destroyed my life. \\n\\njerry: (stares into coffee cup and looks back at george) problem? \\n\\ngeorge: the rosses have started up a foundation, jerry, and i have to sit on the board of directors. \\n\\njerry: hey, board of directors. look at you! \\n\\ngeorge: yeah! look at me! i was free and clear! i was living the dream! i was stripped to the waist, eating a block of cheese the size of a car battery! \\n\\njerry: before we go any further, i\\'d just like to point out how disturbing it is that you equate eating a block of cheese with some sort of bachelor paradise. \\n\\ngeorge: don\\'t you see? i\\'m back in. \\n\\njerry: all because of wrath of khan? \\n\\ngeorge: yes! \\n\\njerry: well, it was the best of those movies. \\n\\ngeorge: khan! \\n\\nwyck: george. \\n\\nwyck: george. (taps him on the shoulder) \\n\\ngeorge: (startled) oh! \\n\\nwyck: i\\'m wyck thayer, chairman of the susan ross foundation. \\n\\ngeorge: wink. \\n\\nwyck: (correcting him) wyck. \\n\\ngeorge: wyck. \\n\\nwyck: now, as you know, the rosses had considerable monies. \\n\\ngeorge: oh. i know they have some monies. \\n\\nwyck: they had more than some monies. many, many monies. and they planned to give a sizable portion of their estate to you and susan after the wedding. \\n\\ngeorge: so, if susan and i had... i mean, if the envelopes hadn\\'t, uh... then we-- \\n\\nwyck: yes. \\n\\ngeorge: and now? \\n\\nwyck: not. it\\'s all been endowed to the foundation, even this townhouse. \\n\\ngeorge: this townhouse? \\n\\nwyck: this would have been your wedding gift. \\n\\ngeorge: and now? \\n\\nwyck: not. \\n\\ngeorge: not. \\n\\nwyck: also endowed. george... i know how much susan meant to you. it can\\'t be easy. \\n\\ngeorge: you know, it really can\\'t. \\n\\ndolores: so who broke it off? \\n\\njerry: well, that\\'s the thing. it was completely mutual. \\n\\ndolores: oh, come on. everybody knows there\\'s no such thing as a mutual breakup. tell me the truth. \\n\\njerry: i am. it was the world\\'s first. \\n\\ndolores: you know, when i heard you got engaged, i thought *maybe* you had matured. but obviously there\\'s no growth here. (exits) \\n\\njerry: well, i can\\'t argue with that, but the fact remains... i was completely... (to himself, cursing her) mulva! \\n\\njerry: (answering) hello? \\n\\nsecretary: please hold for elaine benes. \\n\\njerry: oh, i don\\'t believe this. \\n\\nelaine: (picking up) jerry! \\n\\njerry: hey! \\n\\nelaine: hey. guess who just finished laying out her first issue of the j. peterman catalog. \\n\\njerry: how\\'s it look? \\n\\nelaine: (muffled, as she\\'s smoking a cigar) it\\'s a peach. \\n\\njerry: huh? \\n\\nelaine: i say, it\\'s a peach. \\n\\njerry: elaine, let me ask you something. when i told you my breakup was mutual, did you believe me? \\n\\nelaine: no, no, no. it\\'s weak. no one\\'s gonna buy it, and you shouldn\\'t be selling it. \\n\\njerry: i gotta do some research here. \\n\\nelaine: hey, hey. me. talking. you know, between you and me, i always thought kramer was a bit of a doofus, but he believed in me. *you* did not. so as i see it, he\\'s not the doofus. *you* are the doofus. \\n\\njerry: oh, i\\'m the doofus? \\n\\nelaine: yeah. you, jerry, are the doofus. \\n\\njerry: you know, it occurs to me that kramer is at karate right now. \\n\\nelaine: oh, well, maybe i\\'ll just go down there and thank him in person. \\n\\njerry: yeah, that\\'s what i was thinking. \\n\\nelaine: kramer! \\n\\nkramer: oh, hey. \\n\\nelaine: what are you doing? \\n\\nkramer: oh, well, i-i-i\\'m dominating. \\n\\nelaine: you never said you were fighting children. \\n\\nkramer: well, it\\'s not the size of the opponent, elaine, it\\'s, uh, the ferocity. \\n\\nelaine: this is what you used to build me up? this is where you got all that stupid katra stuff? \\n\\nkramer: no, no. that\\'s from, uh, star trek iii... the search for spock. \\n\\nelaine: search... for spock?! \\n\\nkramer: yeah, i know jerry will tell you that the wrath of khan is the better picture, but for me, i always... \\n\\nelaine: (pushes him) you doofus! \\n\\njerry: okay, question #8. what if i told you my fiancee left me for another man? does that make me more likable, less likable, as likable? let\\'s start over here this time. \\n\\nwaitress #1: more. \\n\\nwaitress #2: less. \\n\\nruthie: same. \\n\\nwillie: are we about through here? \\n\\nkramer: i thought you said your mom was meeting us in the alley. \\n\\njoey: she had a little change of plans. \\n\\nkramer: what\\'s going on? hey, timmy, clara. that was some kind of workout we had tonight, huh? \\n\\ngirl: now we finish it. \\n\\nkramer: aah! aah! mama! \\n\\njerry: (on the phone) dad, i wouldn\\'t eat anything you caught in that pond out in front of the condo. \\n\\njerry: uh, look, elaine\\'s here, i gotta get going. oh, by the way, uh, i\\'m not getting married. tell mom. bye. (hangs up) \\n\\njerry: so... did you stop by the dojo? \\n\\nelaine: yep. \\n\\njerry: how\\'s your confidence level? \\n\\nelaine: shot. \\n\\njerry: self-esteem? \\n\\nelaine: gone. \\n\\njerry: doofus? \\n\\nelaine: (raises her hand) yo. \\n\\njerry: all right, so what? you put out the catalog. how bad could it be? \\n\\njerry: what is that? \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s the urban sombrero. i put it on the cover. \\n\\njerry: well, nobody sees the... cover. \\n\\nkramer: god! \\n\\njerry: what happened to you? \\n\\nkramer: whew! i got whooped. you should have seen the rage in their little eyes. and those tiny little fists of fury. oh. (notices the urban sombrero) what is that? \\n\\njerry: it\\'s the new cover of the j. peterman catalog. it is elaine\\'s choice. let\\'s congratulate her. \\n\\nkramer: oh i see. (elaine walks up to him) woof! \\n\\nelaine: (pointing a finger accusingly at kramer) you! this is all your fault! you told me i could run the company! \\n\\nkramer: well, then i was way off! \\n\\nelaine: well, i\\'ll see ya... (exits) \\n\\njerry: vaya con dios. \\n\\nkramer: (with his forehead in his hands) man, i gotta go lay down. you and george going out a little later? \\n\\njerry: no, he\\'s still stuck at the foundation. \\n\\nkramer: you know, you oughta go down there and help him out. he\\'s a widower. \\n\\njerry: widower? wait a second. (goes to a notebook of his research) \\n\\nwyck: okay, let\\'s see. the beachhouse. 48 acres... ooh. southampton. that should fetch a fair price. \\n\\ngeorge: would i have had access to that? \\n\\nwyck: of course, it would have been yours. \\n\\ngeorge: and now? \\n\\ngeorge: (anticipating the answer) not. \\n\\ngeorge: hello? \\n\\njerry: hey, georgie! i\\'m doing some research down at the coffee shop. your story\\'s the one. \\n\\ngeorge: my story? \\n\\njerry: yeah, your widower story\\'s tested through the roof. (various patrons give the thumbs up in approval) when are you getting out of there? \\n\\ngeorge: uh, excuse me, wyck. uh, are we, uh, almost done here? \\n\\nwyck: (chuckling) oh, no, not even close. \\n\\ngeorge: (remorsefully) i can\\'t go. \\n\\njerry: what do you mean you can\\'t go? there\\'s two really girls sitting at the counter eating grilled cheese. cheese, george! cheese! \\n\\nwyck: okay, next item. susan\\'s doll collection. estimated value $2.6 million. what do you say we go through this doll by doll? \\n\\ngeorge: you want me to find a poem about susan? may she rest in peace?! \\n\\nwyck: well, we think it would be a nice touch for the foundation literature. do you have a favorite poet, george? \\n\\ngeorge: i like, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.) \\n\\nwyck: pardon? \\n\\ngeorge: (mutters it again) \\n\\nwyck: well, you should choose the poem since you knew susan best at the time of her unfortunate (clears his throat)...accident. \\n\\njerry: he cleared his throat? \\n\\ngeorge: yes! \\n\\njerry: so? \\n\\ngeorge: he did it right as he said \"her unfortunate accident.\" \\n\\njerry: not getting it. \\n\\ngeorge: jerry, a throat-clear is a non-verbal implication of doubt - he thinks i killed susan! \\n\\njerry: oh, help me, rhonda. \\n\\ngeorge: what time is it? \\n\\njerry (looks at his watch): 115. \\n\\ngeorge: right now? \\n\\njerry: i gotta go meet pam. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, the bookstore girl. how\\'s that goin\\'? \\n\\njerry: okay. i\\'m just not ga-ga over her. for once i\\'d like to be ga-ga. \\n\\ngeorge: where\\'s elaine? \\n\\njerry: she\\'s having carol, gail and lisa over. you know they all have kids now? \\n\\ngeorge: what\\'s with all these people having babies? \\n\\njerry: perpetuation of the species. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah! right! \\n\\njerry: by the way, just for the record - \\n\\ngeorge: no, i did not! (they exit the coffee shop.) \\n\\ncarol: ...but because it comes out of your baby, it smells good! \\n\\nelaine: well, that\\'s...that\\'s sweet. \\n\\ngail: being a mother has made me feel so beautiful. \\n\\ncarol: elaine, you gotta have a baby! \\n\\nelaine: oh, hey, you know...i had a piece of whitefish over at barney greengrass the other day... \\n\\nlisa: elaine. move to long island and have a baby already. \\n\\nelaine: i really like the city. \\n\\ncarol: the city\\'s a toilet. when\\'s the last time you saw my little adam? \\n\\nelaine: uh, it was in the hamptons. \\n\\ncarol: oh! i have pictures! \\n\\nelaine: no, no, that\\'s okay, it\\'s uh... \\n\\ncarol (shows elaine and the girls pictures of adam): look at him! just look at him! \\n\\njerry: so, elaine was telling me about this piece of whitefish she had the other day... \\n\\ngeorge: do you really think i\\'m wrong about this wyck guy? \\n\\njerry: you know, if you really want to test him out, why don\\'t you try the old jerry lewis trick? \\n\\ngeorge: jerry lewis? \\n\\njerry: i heard that when jerry lewis left a meeting, he\\'d purposefully leave a briefcase with a tape recorder in it. then after five minutes, he\\'d come back for it and listen to what everyone said about him. \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s pretty paranoid. \\n\\njerry: yes, it is. \\n\\ngeorge: i like it! \\n\\njerry: i thought you might. \\n\\npam: oh, hi! i\\'m pam. you must be kramer. (kramer is smitten with pam and grins goofily.) jerry\\'s told me a lot about you. (kramer continues grinning.) well, i\\'m supposed to meet jerry, it\\'s my day off. i work in a bookstore. \\n\\nkramer (mouths the words): books. (knocks over a bowl of fruit on the counter.) \\n\\npam: oh, careful! (jerry enters.) \\n\\njerry: hi, sorry i\\'m late. \\n\\npam: that\\'s okay. kramer let me in. \\n\\njerry: you know, if we rush, we can still make the movie. \\n\\npam: okay. (touches kramer\\'s hand) it was really nice meeting you. \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m in trouble, buddy. i just met a woman. \\n\\nnewman: go on. \\n\\nkramer: well, she\\'s jerry\\'s girlfriend. \\n\\nnewman: ah, yes. forbidden love. \\n\\nkramer: she works in a book shop. her name is pam. \\n\\nnewman: \"pam.\" i don\\'t know the woman, but she sounds quite fetching. \\n\\nkramer: i can\\'t even speak in front of her. (sits down on the couch.) \\n\\nnewman: jerry! what could she possibly see in jerry? (walks in front of kramer and trips over his feet.) \\n\\nkramer: she has delicate beauty. \\n\\nnewman: jerry wouldn\\'t know delicate beauty if it bludgeoned him over the head. \\n\\nkramer: and yet, he\\'s my friend. \\n\\nnewman: and therein lies the tragedy. for i believe, sadly for you, that there is but one woman meant for each of us. one perfect angel for whom we are put on this earth. \\n\\nkramer: aw, that\\'s beautiful, newman. \\n\\nnewman: one winsome tulip we ceaselessly yearn for throughout our dreary, workaday lives! and you, my friend, have found your angel. i can tell. for my heart has also been captured by a breathless beauty - whom i fear i will never possess. \\n\\nkramer: i thought we were talking about me. \\n\\nnewman: right. kramer, you have to confront jerry. \\n\\nkramer: confront jerry? i can\\'t. \\n\\nnewman: you must! \\n\\nkramer: i won\\'t! \\n\\nnewman: you will! \\n\\nelaine (to jerry, imitating carol): \"elaine, ya gotta have a baby.\" ugh. \\n\\ngeorge: where are all the poetry magazines? \\n\\nelaine: the new yorker has poetry. \\n\\ngeorge: yes. the new yorker. \\n\\njerry: why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so much? \\n\\nelaine: they\\'re my friends, but they act as if having a baby takes some kind of talent. \\n\\njerry: c\\'mon, you want to have a baby. \\n\\nelaine: why? because i can? \\n\\njerry: it\\'s the life force. i saw a show on the mollusk last night. elaine, the mollusk travels from alaska to chile just for a shot at another mollusk. you think you\\'re any better? \\n\\nelaine: yes! i think i am better than the mollusk! \\n\\nkevin: i couldn\\'t help overhearing what you were saying. \\n\\nelaine: oh, i\\'m sorry. \\n\\nkevin: no, no, i think i agree with you. i mean, all this talk about having babies. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, like you must procreate. \\n\\nkevin: besides, anyone can do it. \\n\\nelaine: oh, it\\'s been done to death. (smiles) \\n\\ngeorge: i, uh, should have a poem very soon now. \\n\\nwyck: are you okay, george? \\n\\ngeorge: no, no, not really. ever since susan passed on, i have good days and bad. (turns the briefcase towards the woman on his left.) some days, i\\'m haunted by one word - why. why susan? why wasn\\'t it me licking those invitations? why am i still here? well, i gotta run. (gets up and leaves the meeting.) \\n\\nwyck: ...and the stock options for this year look quite, uh... (george returns and retrieves the briefcase.) \\n\\ngeorge (apologetic): briefcase. (shrugs and exits.) \\n\\nelaine: so, kevin. if i don\\'t want children, does that make me a bad humanitarian? \\n\\nkevin: not at all. \\n\\nelaine: \\'cause, i mean, when you get to know me, you\\'ll see that i\\'m a pretty good humanitarian. (waitress comes to the table and pours more coffee.) you are doing a wonderful job, by the way. thanks a lot. (to kevin) right? am i right? (kramer walks by.) kramer. kramer! come here, look at my new friend kevin. (kramer and kevin shake hands.) oh, you got a little, uh... \\n\\nkramer (wipes chocolate off his face): oh, i just had two double-fudge sundaes. \\n\\nelaine: oh. are you alright? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, i\\'ll be okay. \\n\\nelaine: you know, jerry has one of those every time he bombs on stage. \\n\\nkramer: well, i\\'m sure he\\'ll be sharing his next one with pam. \\n\\nelaine: oh, no...that won\\'t last. \\n\\nkramer: what do you mean? \\n\\nelaine: he\\'s not ga-ga. \\n\\ngeorge: lemme tell you something, that jerry lewis? you wonder how some of these people get to the top? it\\'s ideas like this! brilliant! hah-hah! (notices that the briefcase is damaged.) look at this - what the hell happened? the whole side is damaged here...and the lock is broken. \\n\\njerry: how long did you leave it up there? \\n\\ngeorge: five minutes. what the hell happened here? \\n\\njerry: play the tape, maybe we\\'ll get a clue. \\n\\ngeorge: i have to rewind it first. (george presses the rewind button on the tape recorder. he and jerry stand there, waiting impatiently as it rewinds.) alright, alright. \\n\\njerry: is that it? \\n\\ngeorge: stopped dead. \\n\\njerry: what do you make of it? \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t know. (george sits down at the table. kramer enters.) \\n\\nkramer: jerry. uh, can we talk? \\n\\ngeorge (to kramer): kinda busy here. \\n\\nkramer: i\\'d like to talk to jerry in private. \\n\\ngeorge: why can\\'t i stay? \\n\\nkramer: because it doesn\\'t concern you. \\n\\ngeorge: well, if it doesn\\'t concern me, then i can stay. (kramer grabs the back of george\\'s chair, drags him out into the hallway and closes the door.) \\n\\njerry: so, what\\'s on your mind? \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s pam. \\n\\njerry: pam? what about pam? \\n\\nkramer: i love her, jerry! \\n\\njerry: you what? \\n\\nkramer: i love her! \\n\\njerry: is that right? \\n\\nkramer: oh, she\\'s uh...she\\'s real. she can bring home the bacon and fry it in the pan. \\n\\njerry: what does that mean? \\n\\nkramer: oh, and that voice! \\n\\njerry: what about her name? \\n\\nkramer: pam? oh, it\\'s a beautiful name. (kramer sits on the couch.) pam. pam. pam! \\n\\njerry: she\\'s got really nice hair. \\n\\nkramer: oh, it\\'s incredible. although, i might replace her tortoise clip with one of those velvet scrunchies. i love those. \\n\\njerry: you\\'ve got really specific tastes. \\n\\nkramer: oh, i know what i want, jerry. \\n\\njerry: she\\'s got nice calves. \\n\\nkramer: oh, she\\'s a dreamboat. but, you don\\'t like her, so... \\n\\njerry: maybe i could, you\\'re making some pretty good points. \\n\\nkramer: no you can\\'t, jerry. \\n\\njerry: but i might. \\n\\nkramer: oh, no you don\\'t. \\n\\njerry: why not? the voice? the calves? the bacon? \\n\\nkramer: what...? \\n\\njerry: i think i can! i even like the name! pam! \\n\\nkramer (frantic): huh? \\n\\njerry: pam! \\n\\nkramer: huh? \\n\\njerry: pam! \\n\\nkramer: huh-yah! (kramer loses it and runs out past george, who is still sitting in the hallway on a chair.) \\n\\nkramer: so now he wants her more than ever! \\n\\nnewman: blast! \\n\\nkramer: what am i gonna do, huh? \\n\\nnewman: don\\'t despair, my friend. (newman walks in front of kramer and trips over his feet. again.) i won\\'t allow your love to go unrequited. not like mine. \\n\\nkramer: what, again with you? \\n\\nnewman: sorry. but love is spice with many tastes. a dizzying array of textures...and moments. \\n\\nkramer: if only i could say things like that around her. \\n\\nnewman (getting an idea): yes... \\n\\nelaine: well, i hear three distinct sounds. a low rumple...followed by a metallic \\'squink\\'... \\n\\ngeorge: yes! yes, i heard the \\'squink\\'! \\n\\nelaine: ...followed by a mysterious...\\'glonk.\\' \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s baffling, isn\\'t it? \\n\\nelaine: well, one question does come to mind. have you considered just...asking them what happened to the briefcase? \\n\\ngeorge: they would never tell me, elaine. first of all, they probably think that i killed susan. besides, i don\\'t even think they like me. (jerry comes over to the table.) \\n\\njerry: that pam! i am ga-ga over her! \\n\\nelaine: ga-ga? when did that happen? \\n\\njerry: yesterday. six-ish. \\n\\nelaine: well, maybe we should double. i\\'m pretty ga-ga myself. \\n\\njerry: you just met the guy yesterday. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, but we have a common goal. \\n\\njerry: a barren, sterile existence that ends when you die? \\n\\nelaine (happily): yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: and you really believe this guy doesn\\'t want to have kids. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, of course. \\n\\njerry: elaine, a guy\\'ll say anything to get a woman. \\n\\nelaine: oh, please. he wouldn\\'t say that. \\n\\ngeorge: elaine, i once told a woman that i coined the phrase, \"pardon my french.\" \\n\\njerry: i once told a woman that i don\\'t eat cake \\'cause it goes right to my thighs. \\n\\ngeorge: i once told a woman that i really enjoy spending time with my family. \\n\\nnewman: with your looks and my words, we\\'ll have built the perfect beast. (kramer claps him on the shoulder, then goes to the other side of the aisle to talk to pam.) \\n\\npam: oh, hi! kramer. \\n\\nnewman (whispers through the bookcase): hi. how are you? \\n\\nkramer: hi. how are you? \\n\\npam: i\\'m great. \\n\\nnewman: i too am well. \\n\\nkramer: i too am well. \\n\\nnewman: do i smell pantene? \\n\\nkramer: do i smell? \\n\\nnewman: pantene! \\n\\nkramer: uh, pantene. \\n\\npam: oh, my shampoo. yeah, it is pantene, i got a free sample in with my junk mail. \\n\\nkramer (talks rapidly in an attempt to keep up with newman): well, there really is no junk-mail...well, everybody wants to get a check or a birthday card, but... \\n\\nnewman (frantic): ...it takes just as much man-power to deliver it as their precious little greeting cards... \\n\\nkramer: newman! (elbows him through the books. newman falls over.) \\n\\npam: what? \\n\\nkramer: uh, human. it\\'s...human to be moved by a fragrance. \\n\\npam: that\\'s so true. \\n\\nkramer: her bouquet cleaved his hardened... \\n\\nnewman: shell. \\n\\nkramer: ...shell. and fondled his muscled heart. he embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell. \\n\\npam: kramer, that is so lovely. \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s by an unknown 20th-century poet. \\n\\npam: oh, what\\'s his name? \\n\\nkramer: newman. (on the other side of the bookcase, newman preens proudly.) \\n\\nkevin: elaine, you\\'ve changed my life. \\n\\nelaine: oh, kevin...you can go on and on about how you don\\'t want kids...and it sounds, it sounds really nice, but...the truth is, i don\\'t know if you mean it or not. \\n\\nkevin: i got a vasectomy this morning. \\n\\nelaine: although, i have a hunch you mean it. \\n\\njerry: i just came by to tell you - i\\'m really, really happy about this relationship. really happy. \\n\\npam: oh. well, that\\'s um...(clears her throat)...nice. (jerry looks suspicious. pam turns around and jerry notices her tortoise clip has been replaced with a velvet scrunchie.) \\n\\njerry\\'s brain: a velvet scrunchie! \\n\\njerry: kramer! \\n\\njerry: hello, newman. \\n\\nnewman: hello, jerry. how\\'s pam? \\n\\njerry: pam? what do you care? (newman shrugs. jerry notices he\\'s carrying a brentano\\'s bookstore bag.) \\n\\nnewman: well, ta-ta! (scampers away.) \\n\\njerry: wait a minute! (a manic chase scene ensues, with jerry chasing newman from one end of the building to the other. jerry finally catches up with him in the hallway on another floor.) \\n\\njerry: alright, newman! this is it! (shoves him against the wall.) \\n\\nnewman (sweating): easy, jerry. steady. you wouldn\\'t want to lose your cool at a time like this. \\n\\njerry: why not? \\n\\nnewman: because right now, i\\'m the only chance you\\'ve got. (newman giggles nervously. jerry makes newman flinch, and his giggling is choked off.) \\n\\njerry (rolls his eyes): c\\'mon. (they exit.) \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t believe i\\'m losing pam! \\n\\nnewman: i know how you feel. for i, too, have a woman for whom i pine. \\n\\njerry: i thought we were talking about me. \\n\\nnewman: right. \\n\\njerry: anyway, i don\\'t need your help. (turns to leave.) \\n\\nnewman: oh, don\\'t you? joke boy? you really think you can manipulate that beautiful young woman like the half-soused nightclub rabble that lap up your inane \"observations\"? \\n\\njerry: alright, newman. what do i have to do to get you to stop pulling the strings for kramer? \\n\\nnewman: well, there is a little something you can do for me... \\n\\njerry: c\\'mon, out with it. \\n\\nnewman: it\\'s about...elaine. \\n\\njerry: elaine? what does she have to - (notices newman looking up at him longlingly.) oh no... \\n\\nnewman: you dated her. give me some inside information. anything i can use! \\n\\njerry (shrugs): well, i know she doesn\\'t want to have kids. (newman considers the implications of this.) \\n\\nkevin: i thought you\\'d be a little more enthusiastic about it. \\n\\nelaine: i know, i don\\'t want...(clears her throat)...kids. \\n\\nkevin: what was that? \\n\\nelaine: well, kevin, maybe i have a little doubt. i mean, nothing is a hundred percent. \\n\\nkevin: this is! oh boy, i always do this. \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\nkevin: oh, i get all jazzed up about something and i go way to far with it. \\n\\nelaine: really? \\n\\nkevin: oh, yeah. like last summer. i\\'m watchin\\' tv and i saw one of those jet-skis. $4000 later and it\\'s sitting in my garage. \\n\\nelaine: you know, that\\'s weird, actually, \\'cause i\\'m sort of the same way. i mean once for like, no reason, i flattened my hair and i had all these strands hanging in my face all the time... \\n\\nkevin: sometimes i think i do want kids. maybe a lot of kids! \\n\\nelaine: sometimes i think about wearing my hair real short. \\n\\nkevin: yeah! i think i like short hair. really short. \\n\\nelaine: yeah! \\n\\nkevin: yeah! \\n\\ngeorge: this is a crude mock-up of the conference room. 1/14th scale. \\n\\njerry: when did you build this thing? \\n\\ngeorge: yesterday, took the day off. (picks up a red power ranger action figure from the model and pretends it\\'s him.) now, from the time i left the room... \\n\\njerry (points at the power ranger): wait, that\\'s you? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. \\n\\njerry (picks up a yellow m&m toy from the model): i really think the m&m should be you. \\n\\ngeorge (grabs the m&m away from jerry): alright, whatever! now. whatever caused the damage...(drops a tiny briefcase onto the table in the model)...was jarring enough to completely stop the tape. \\n\\njerry: and? \\n\\ngeorge: okay. that\\'s what we know. \\n\\njerry: but we already knew that. \\n\\ngeorge: well, yeah. \\n\\njerry: just give me some idea of what you think it could be. \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t know if you\\'re ready for it. \\n\\njerry: please. \\n\\ngeorge: i believe that i am about to become the target of a systematic process of intimidation and manipulation, the likes of which you have never - \\n\\njerry: hold it, hold it! you\\'re right, i\\'m not ready for this. (the door buzzer sounds, jerry answers it.) yeah? \\n\\nvoice on speaker: it\\'s pam. \\n\\njerry: c\\'mon up. (to george) alright, it\\'s pam, you gotta get goin.\\' \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m not through here, jerry. (picks up the model of the conference room.) i\\'m gonna keep on investigating. this thing is like an onion. the more layers you peel, the more it stinks. (pam enters, george leaves.) \\n\\npam: what was that? \\n\\njerry: we were just playin.\\' \\n\\npam: listen, i had a long talk with kramer today... \\n\\njerry: uh huh... \\n\\npam: well, the thing is, i uh...i think i have a little crush on him. (kramer slides in the door on his knees.) \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m so happy! my world suddenly has meaning! \\n\\njerry (to pam): this is the man you have a crush on? \\n\\npam: well, i have feelings for both of you. \\n\\nkramer: how can you have feelings for him? we\\'re soul mates. \\n\\njerry: why can\\'t i be a soul mate? \\n\\nkramer: jerry, you really think that pam would want you to be the father of her children? \\n\\npam: children? who said anything about children? i don\\'t want to have children. \\n\\ngeorge: there are some people in this room who would have been very happy to never see this briefcase again. there are people in this room who think they can destroy other people\\'s property and get away with it. well, let me tell you something about those people. they weren\\'t counting on this brain! and this tape recorder. \\n\\nwyck: george... \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'ll have your turn! the truth must be heard. (plays back the tape.) that\\'s all there was. and yet, it speaks volumes. a low rumple. a metallic \\'squink.\\' a \\'glonk.\\' someone crying out...\"dear god!\" let\\'s start with, uh...with you, wyck. \\n\\nwyck: george, quinn here was moving a chair...he lost his balance and dropped it...it must have fallen on your briefcase, which, for some reason, contained a running tape recorder? \\n\\ngeorge: alright, then. we\\'ve gotten to the bottom of that. \\n\\nelaine: what are you guys doing here? \\n\\njerry: we\\'re getting vasectomies. \\n\\nelaine: why? \\n\\nnewman (to elaine): i\\'m doing it for you. \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\njerry (to elaine): what\\'d you do to your hair? \\n\\nelaine: i cut it. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s a little short. \\n\\nkevin: y\\'think? \\n\\njerry (to kevin): what are you doing here? \\n\\nelaine: kevin\\'s having his vasectomy reversed. \\n\\njerry and newman: reversed?! (kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. jerry and newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.) \\n\\ngeorge: ...he embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell. \\n\\nwyck: is that a keats poem? \\n\\ngeorge: no, it\\'s a newman. well, i gotta run. (smiles, pats his briefcase and exits.) \\n\\nwyck: does anyone think george might have murdered susan? \\n\\nmr. cross: oh, yeah. i just assumed he murdered her. \\n\\nms. baines: of course he killed her. \\n\\nwyck: so it\\'s not just me, then. alright! back to business. \\n\\njerry: all right. how \\'bout this one let\\'s say you\\'re abducted by aliens. \\n\\ngeorge: fine. \\n\\njerry: they haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. now would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus? \\n\\ngeorge: i gotta go zoo. i feel like i could set more of my own schedule. \\n\\njerry: but in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet! \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m wearin\\' a little hat, i\\'m jumpin\\' through fire.. they\\'re puttin\\' their little alien heads in my mouth.. \\n\\njerry: (resigned) at least it\\'s show business.. \\n\\ngeorge: but in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate. \\n\\njerry: what if she\\'s got no interest in you? \\n\\ngeorge: w--then i\\'m pretty much where i am now. at least i got to take a ride on a spaceship. \\n\\n[exterior long shot: looking up at an office building; interior of office reception area of \"brand/leland\" as george, jerry, and kramer come in. they calmly keep it quiet.] \\n\\nkramer: george, why couldn\\'t i use the bathroom in that store? \\n\\ngeorge: kramer, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown! \\n\\nkramer: (frustrated) wha?? \\n\\njerry: (dry) he knows. \\n\\ngeorge: (anyway,) on the left--exquisite marble! high ceilings. an\\' a flush, like a jet engine! (imitates sound) ha ha! \\n\\nkramer: (impressed) now, listen, uh. you better not wait. i\\'ll catch you later. \\n\\ngeorge: you sure? \\n\\njerry: (dry) he knows. \\n\\ngeorge: wow. nice. \\n\\njerry: why don\\'t you try your engagement story? \\n\\ngeorge: (considers, but got into elevator) won\\'t work. \\n\\njerry: are you sure? \\n\\ngeorge: (wry) he knows. \\n\\nelaine: look. kevin. i really like you, heh, heh, uh. but, um, maybe we\\'d be, better off just being.. friends. (takes a bite of her sandwich) \\n\\nkevin: friends? \\n\\nelaine: well. i mean. (distracted by the food) oh, god. this tuna tastes like an old sponge. \\n\\nkevin: friends. yeah! why not friends? i might like to try that! like you an\\' jerry! \\n\\nman: (frustrated) damn thing is jammed again.. \\n\\nkramer: you know what happens with these? the rollers, they get flat spots on \\'em. (hits button several times and whacks it) \\n\\nman: come on, let\\'s go. \\n\\nkramer: (absently wants to be part of it) oh, yeah--yeah.. (follows them) \\n\\nelaine: (to jerry) remember i was telling you about gillian, my friend who writes for the l.l. bean catalogue? i really think you should give her a call. \\n\\njerry: (doubtful) i don\\'t know, do you have a-- \\n\\njerry: not bad. wuh--what does she-- \\n\\nelaine: (dry) i put her stats on the back. \\n\\njerry: pretty impressive--\"serious boyfriend \\'92 to \\'95.\" owns her own car.. \"favorite president james polk!\" (elaine had echoed \"uh-huh. yup.\" during it) \\n\\ngeorge: hnn! let me see that. \\n\\njerry: (hands it to him as he asks elaine) so how\\'d it go with kevin? did you, steel-toe his ass back to kentucky? \\n\\nelaine: (laughs in appreciation) you are not gonna believe this! i told him that i just wanted to be friends. he\\'s fine with it. he really wants to be friends. \\n\\njerry: why would anybody want a friend. \\n\\nelaine: (dread) uh. it\\'s really not that bad, actually. he said he\\'d even go with me to the museum of miniatures. this is something you would never ever do. \\n\\njerry: i mean all that stuff is so small.. ((elaine is wryly assessing him)) stupid.. \\n\\ngeorge: (still looking at that picture) you know if i told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiance.. \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\ngeorge: don\\'t you see. women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. people like me have not been inside in thousands of years.. but with this, it\\'s like i\\'ve already been with one of her own! my hands been stamped! i come and go as i please! \\n\\nelaine: (wry, not impressed) well you cracked it! i warned the queen you were gettin\\' close an\\', now it looks like we\\'re gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. (chuckles with jerry) \\n\\ngeorge: (getting up) can i keep this? \\n\\nelaine: no, i need it. \\n\\ngeorge: (absently leaving with it) thanks. \\n\\ngeorge: hi. i\\'m ah, i\\'m here to see a mr. art vandelay.. \\n\\namanda: i\\'m sorry sir, there is no mr. vandelay here.. \\n\\ngeorge: (taking out wallet) well, let me. heh. let me just eh.. check an\\', make sure i have the right man--ha! heh, heh, heh! seems--oh! i, oh!

(doorbell rings) who is it? \\n\\nfeldman: (off-screen) feldman.. from across the hall. \\n\\nkevin: (smiles, relieved) hold on. \\n\\nfeldman: kevin! brought some groceries. \\n\\nkevin: again?! feldman, you didn\\'t have to do that! \\n\\nfeldman: hey, what are friends for? \\n\\nkevin: you know, i may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have. \\n\\nkevin: (eyes closed in hug) oh. me so happy. me want to cry. \\n\\nkramer: i wouldn\\'t walk over there. \\n\\njerry: why not? \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s the most dangerous part of the sidewalk. cab hops a curb, wap! you\\'ve had your last egg sandwich. \\n\\njerry: what about over there? you know air conditioners fall out all the time. \\n\\nkramer: i\\'d much rather get hit by an 80 pound air conditioner than a two ton cab. \\n\\njerry: no, cab\\'s comin\\' in right here (hand at waist) set of plastic hips, prosthetic legs, and a monkey to answer the door, i\\'m back in business. \\n\\nkramer: much rather take it to the head, like i did in \\'79. \\n\\njerry: you were livin\\' in the village then, right? \\n\\nkramer: don\\'t really remember. \\n\\nelaine: (showing fingernails) toxic waste green. \\n\\njerry: that is disgusting. \\n\\nelaine: you know, revulsion has now become a valid form of attraction. \\n\\njerry: well, then you\\'re drivin\\' me wild. \\n\\nelaine: i had \\'em done for the big peterman bash i\\'m throwin\\'. \\n\\njerry: (george enters) oh, why you havin\\' a party? \\n\\nelaine: i drive my people hard, and then i reward them. \\n\\njerry: like with dogs. \\n\\nelaine: exactly. \\n\\ngeorge: party? \\n\\nelaine: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: food? \\n\\nelaine: uh huh. \\n\\ngeorge: bar? \\n\\nelaine: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: george? \\n\\njerry: he\\'s gonna show up anyway. \\n\\nelaine: george, i just don\\'t want you interfering. \\n\\ngeorge: how could i possibly interfere? \\n\\njerry: isn\\'t that what jack ruby said? \\n\\ngeorge: (eating) oh yeah. these are fantastic, fantastic. (to server) you know, i\\'d love to get a jump on the next batch, where do you come out? (server leaves) (to anna) she\\'s been ignoring this section all night. quesadilla? \\n\\nanna: no thanks. \\n\\ngeorge: hi ah, my name is george. \\n\\nanna: anna. i don\\'t recall seeing you around the office. do you work in the mail room? \\n\\ngeorge: no, i\\'m a friend of elaine benes. \\n\\nanna: oh. excuse me. (she leaves) \\n\\ngeorge: so... \\n\\nman: how \\'bout leading us in a toast? \\n\\nelaine: oh sure. hey guys, i wanna make a toast. um... here\\'s to us who wish us well, and those who don\\'t can go to hell... all right, who\\'s dancin\\'? c\\'mon, who\\'s dancin\\'? you want me, you want me to get it started? i\\'ll get it started. whew! (she dances) \\n\\ngeorge: sweet fancy moses! \\n\\nkramer: you get the tickets? \\n\\njerry: who wants two? special sneak preview of death blow. \\n\\nkramer: death blow when someone tries to blow you up, not because of who you are, but for different reasons altogether. (jerry buzzes up george) jerry, do you think you can get an extra ticket for my friend brody? \\n\\njerry: kramer, do you know what i had to go through to get these? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, i know, but he\\'s a big fan of the genre. you know i\\'d consider it a personal favor to me. \\n\\njerry: yeah i guess i do owe you. \\n\\nkramer: uh, listen, do you want me to stay here until george gets up? \\n\\njerry: no, i\\'m okay. \\n\\nkramer: there\\'s no problem, really. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m fine. (george enters, kramer exits) how was the party? \\n\\ngeorge: food was good. \\n\\njerry: yeah, so i didn\\'t miss anything? \\n\\ngeorge: well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment. (pause) have you ever seen elaine dance? \\n\\njerry: elaine danced? \\n\\ngeorge: it was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music. \\n\\njerry: did she do the little kicks and the thumbs? \\n\\ngeorge: what, you mean you know about this? \\n\\njerry: for some time... (video of elaine dancing on the street with jerry and the street musicians watching her awful dance) it was about five years ago. i never knew what to say to her about it. it was one of those problems i hoped would just go away. \\n\\ngeorge: well, sometimes you can\\'t help these people \\'til they hit rock bottom. \\n\\njerry: and by then you\\'ve lost interest. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. i borrowed my father\\'s car. \\'68 gto. \\n\\njerry: what made him get that thing? \\n\\ngeorge: during that period when my folks were separated he went a little crazy. \\n\\njerry: not a very long trip. (enter kramer) \\n\\nkramer: brody\\'s in. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t even have the extra ticket yet. \\n\\nkramer: well, you better get on the horn. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m tellin\\' you jerry i\\'m gettin\\' a vibe. if i didn\\'t know better, i\\'d say the staff completely lost respect for me. (staff mocks her dancing in the background) \\n\\njerry: how could that be? \\n\\nelaine: jerry, it\\'s like the feeling is palpable. you think it could have something to do with the party? \\n\\njerry: no, george was there, he said he had a great time. \\n\\nelaine: ah, it\\'s george. i bet you this is somehow george related. \\n\\njerry: oh, what are you talkin\\' about? \\n\\nelaine: he\\'s like a virus. he attaches himself to a healthy host company, and the next thing you know, the entire staff\\'s infected. \\n\\njerry: now you\\'re talkin\\' crazy! \\n\\nelaine: all right, jerry, if that\\'s not what it is, you tell me. what is it? \\n\\njerry: (makes sound) oh there\\'s my call waiting, i gotta get goin\\'. \\n\\nanna: you have a minute to approve some copy? \\n\\nelaine: oh yeah, sure, sure. so ah, did ya have a good time at the party last night? \\n\\nanna: it was a real... kick. \\n\\nelaine: hey, did you happen to speak to my friend george? \\n\\nanna: as a matter of fact i did. \\n\\nelaine: ah hah. well, listen. you would be wise to keep your distance from him. \\n\\nanna: why? he seems harmless. \\n\\nelaine: oh he\\'s not. he\\'s very harmful. \\n\\nanna: really? \\n\\nelaine: oh trust me. he\\'s a bad seed. he\\'s a horrible seed. he\\'s one of the worst seeds i\\'ve ever seen. \\n\\nanna: and you two are friends? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, we\\'re good friends. \\n\\ngeorge: so this anna called me from out of the blue. \\n\\njerry: really? i thought you were rebuffed. \\n\\ngeorge: with extreme prejudice. \\n\\njerry: maybe elaine put in a good word for you. \\n\\ngeorge: no, no. that\\'s just the thing. anna told me that elaine said i was one of the worst seeds she\\'d ever seen. \\n\\njerry: interesting. she doesn\\'t care for you, then a stern warning, suddenly a phone call. seems elaine\\'s made you the bad boy. and anna digs the bad boy. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m the bad boy. i\\'ve never been the bad boy. \\n\\njerry: you\\'ve been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend... \\n\\ngeorge: yes ... yes, yes \\n\\njerry: the bad fianc&mac226;, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk... \\n\\ngeorge: okay, the point is made. \\n\\njerry: the bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... (looks at table as george exits) the bad tipper! \\n\\njerry: half of show business is here. \\n\\nkramer: there\\'s brody. brody! over here. \\n\\nbrody: hey kramer. and you must be jerry. thanks for the ticket. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s quite a feed bag you\\'re workin\\' on there. \\n\\nbrody: it\\'s for all of us. is there a problem? \\n\\nkramer: brody, c\\'mon. he\\'s just kidding. he\\'s a joke maker. tell him, jerry. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m a joke maker. \\n\\nkramer: all right, here we go, death blow. (brody takes out video camera) \\n\\njerry: (to kramer) hey, hey, what the hell is he doing? \\n\\nkramer: relax, he does that all the time. \\n\\njerry: does what? \\n\\nkramer: he\\'s making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, hum? \\n\\njerry: may i see you outside for a moment please? \\n\\nkramer: but i want to-- \\n\\njerry: outside! \\n\\nelaine: hey, have you seen anna? \\n\\nworker: uh, she just went to meet your friend george. \\n\\nelaine: to meet george? i knew it. where did they go? \\n\\nworker: the park, why? \\n\\nelaine: don\\'t you see? george is in the bloodstream! you stay away from him, too! \\n\\njerry: what do you mean he\\'s bootlegging the movie? \\n\\nkramer: well, it\\'s a perfectly legitimate business. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s not legitimate. \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s a business. \\n\\njerry: where did you meet this guy? \\n\\nkramer: he\\'s a friend of a friend. you know corky ramarez up on 94th street? one day he and i are playing pachinco-- \\n\\njerry: kramer. (boom sound) \\n\\nkramer: man, we\\'re missin\\' the death blow! \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t believe this. (they run into theater) \\n\\nanna: you know i\\'m not supposed to be talking to you. \\n\\ngeorge: no one\\'s putting a gun to your head. do i, uh, scare you? \\n\\nanna: no... a little. nice car. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, she\\'s a sweet ride. \\n\\nanna: is that your orthopedic back pillow? \\n\\ngeorge: maybe. \\n\\nanna: well is it or isn\\'t it? \\n\\ngeorge: guess not. \\n\\nelaine: (to george) stay away from her. \\n\\ngeorge: i didn\\'t do nothin\\'. \\n\\nelaine: (to anna) get in the car. \\n\\nanna: but... \\n\\nelaine: you heard me young lady, get in the car. (to george) and you, you should know better. i don\\'t want you infecting my staff. \\n\\ngeorge: lighten up. \\n\\nkramer: go get \\'em, death blow! (to brody) you okay? \\n\\n(movie voice: so death blow, we meet again ...) \\n\\nbrody: uh, i got a cramp. \\n\\nkramer: well, it\\'s no wonder. you ate that entire bag of candy. \\n\\nbrody: uh, there it goes again. kramer, you gotta drive me home. \\n\\njerry: hey, what is going on over there? \\n\\nbrody: jerry, finish shooting the movie for me. \\n\\njerry: are you nuts? there\\'s no way i\\'m holding that thing. \\n\\nkramer: jerry, if the man is in pain... \\n\\njerry: yeah well, maybe if he didn\\'t lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we would\\'ve eaten some. serves him right. \\n\\nbrody: (pulls out a gun) what are you some kind of tough guy? \\n\\nkramer: okay. let\\'s everybody just relax. jerry, take the camera. \\n\\njerry: all right, i\\'m, i,m takin\\' the camera. \\n\\nkramer: (to brody) c\\'mon, let\\'s go. \\n\\njerry: oh man... \\n\\nkramer: hey man, so how was the rest of death blow? \\n\\njerry: how was the rest of death blow? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, who got the final death blow, \\'cause i thought that hawaiian guy, he had it comin\\' to him! \\n\\njerry: kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point! \\n\\nkramer: he\\'s quite a character, isn\\'t he? \\n\\njerry: you know, he came by here at 3 o\\'clock in the morning to pick up the tape. i was scared out of my mind! \\n\\nkramer: i got it. yep. \\n\\nbrody: brody. \\n\\nkramer: come on up. it\\'s brody. \\n\\njerry: what are you, crazy? i don\\'t want to see this guy again. \\n\\nkramer: jerry, you did him a favor. he probably wants to come up and thank you. \\n\\njerry: what if i didn\\'t do it right? \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s your first time. he\\'ll understand. \\n\\njerry: people with guns don\\'t understand. that\\'s why they get guns. too many misunderstandings. \\n\\nkramer: hey, brody! \\n\\njerry: hi. \\n\\nbrody: jerry, i have to talk to you about the tape. \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\nbrody: i\\'ve never seen such beautiful work. \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nbrody: (con,t) you\\'re a genius. the zoom-ins, the framing. i was enchanted. \\n\\njerry: well, i did the best i could. \\n\\nbrody: i got another project for you. it\\'s a movie called cry cry again. i was gonna give it to one of my other guys, but it\\'s an arty movie and quite frankly, they don\\'t have the sensibility. \\n\\nbrody: may i use your phone? \\n\\nkramer: uh yeah. it\\'s under the couch. \\n\\nkramer: look at you! you\\'ve got another gig! uhh. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t want another gig! i\\'m not doin\\' this. \\n\\nkramer: but you have a gift. jerry, this is not your little comedy act. we\\'re talkin\\' feature films. \\n\\njerry: we\\'re talkin\\' federal crime here. \\n\\nbrody: (to jerry) i\\'ll expect that tape by three o\\'clock tomorrow. (to kramer) may i borrow this? (holding baseball bat) \\n\\nkramer: sure, do you need a glove? \\n\\nbrody: nah. \\n\\nworker: i pressed through the rushes and there, the native dancers whirled before me limbs flailing, arms akimbo, feet kicking up dust... (all workers laugh) \\n\\nelaine: what? what is so funny? \\n\\nanna: sorry, i got hung up. \\n\\nelaine: at yankee stadium? \\n\\nanna: this? it\\'s mine. \\n\\nelaine: oh really? \\'cause it looks a little big for you. it looks like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear. \\n\\nanna: he\\'s not stocky. \\n\\nelaine: who did that? who did that?!? \\n\\nkramer: (laughing) the french guy fell off his bike. oh man, that\\'s precious. (eats popcorn) \\n\\njerry: no, no, no, no, no, no, no! what were you thinking when you shot this? \\n\\nkramer: that\\'s fine. \\n\\njerry: do you even know what this scene is about? \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s about a guy buying a loaf of bread. \\n\\njerry: no, bread is his soul. he\\'s trying to buy back a loaf of his soul. \\n\\nkramer: wha? where? \\n\\njerry: kramer there is no way you\\'re giving this tape to brody and telling him i shot it. \\n\\nkramer: nah, nah, he\\'s not going to know the difference. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t care about brody. i was up on 96th street today, there was a kid couldn\\'t have been more than ten years old. he was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as death blow. that\\'s who i care about. the little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won\\'t let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and i take for granted. \\n\\nkramer: so you\\'ll do the movie? (jerry watches the movie kramer shot - we hear kramer, on the tape say \\'ah man, i sat in gum\\') \\n\\njerry: i have to. but i\\'m gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. where are my magic markers? \\n\\nkramer: right here. (elaine enters) \\n\\nelaine: well, i have lost complete control of my staff. why did i let george go to that party? i mean, we were having so much fun. we were wining, we were dining, we were dancing. (she starts dancing, kramer flips out) what? \\n\\nkramer: (he shows her) this umpf thing. \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s dancing. \\n\\nkramer: no, no. that ain\\'t dancing, sally. \\n\\nelaine: i dance fine. \\n\\nkramer: you stink. (he exits) \\n\\nelaine: he doesn\\'t know what he\\'s talkin\\' about. (jerry fake laughs) jer? jerry, i\\'m a good dancer, right? \\n\\njerry: i forgot to make my bed. (he tries to get away) \\n\\nelaine: jerry, do i stink? \\n\\njerry: all right, you\\'re beyond stink. \\n\\nelaine: but i really enjoy dancing. \\n\\njerry: and that\\'s not helpin\\' either. that\\'s why you\\'re havin\\' trouble with your staff, not because of george. \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s that bad? \\n\\njerry: have you ever seen yourself? (she starts dancing) ah, ah, please, please. not in my home. i gotta go throw this stuff in the laundry. i\\'ll be right back. \\n\\nvoice: i have george costanza still holding. \\n\\nelaine: george, hi. i have anna here. there\\'s something i wanna say to both of you. \\n\\ngeorge: yo, anna. \\n\\nanna: hi, george. what\\'re you up to? \\n\\ngeorge: (ironing) you don\\'t wanna know. \\n\\nelaine: uh, well, listen. i feel really horrible about trying to keep you two apart and i just wanted to apologize. \\n\\ngeorge: what, wha, what\\'re you talkin\\' about? \\n\\nelaine: well, george, i just want you to hear me say to anna that you\\'re a good and decent person. \\n\\ngeorge: pick up the phone, elaine. pick it up! \\n\\nelaine: i never should have given anna the impression-- \\n\\ngeorge: pick it up, pick it up! \\n\\nelaine: --that you\\'re a bad seed, i mean, you\\'re a fine seed. \\n\\ngeorge: elaine, get off the speaker! (elaine picks up phone) \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\ngeorge: you are ruinin\\' everything. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m trying to help. why are you being so difficult? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. that\\'s it. more of that, difficult. i\\'m a difficult seed. \\n\\nelaine: george, i don\\'t have time for this. uh, anna, do you wanna talk to george? \\n\\nanna: um, no, i don\\'t think so. \\n\\nelaine: no, she doesn\\'t want to. okay, bye, george. we\\'ll see ya. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m a bad man! \\n\\nbrody: so where\\'s the tape? \\n\\njerry: no, i didn\\'t shoot this one. i\\'m just scouting the location. \\n\\nbrody: i need the tape. \\n\\njerry: you\\'ll get your tape. but here\\'s what i\\'m gonna need. i\\'m gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. and i want headsets for the guys runnin\\' \\'em. i wanna be able to talk to \\'em. \\n\\nbrody: are you out of your mind? \\n\\njerry: kramer... \\n\\nkramer: i know, jerry. it\\'s okay. (jerry steps aside) yeah, look, brody. uh, jerry wants to do the bootleg. he\\'s dyin\\' to do it. but if you don\\'t make him happy, the work suffers. and then, nobody\\'s happy. \\n\\nbrody: just shoot the damn thing so i can get it out on the street! \\n\\njerry: all right. that\\'s it, i can\\'t work like this. \\n\\nkramer: jerry... \\n\\njerry: i\\'m off the project. (he exits) \\n\\nkramer: jerry! \\n\\nbrody: i want the tape. \\n\\nkramer: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: well, i\\'m the good boy again. can you believe that? \\n\\njerry: they think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs. \\n\\ngeorge: anna actually has respect for me now. (laughs/snorts) it\\'s all over. \\n\\njerry: eh, the whole business has changed. it\\'s all about money now. the sad thing is it\\'s the kids that suffer. (kramer enters) \\n\\nkramer: listen, man. you gotta shoot this movie for me. brody, he\\'s a reasonable man, but he\\'s insane! \\n\\njerry: kramer, i\\'m not doin\\' this anymore. i don\\'t know what i was thinking. it\\'s illegal, it\\'s dangerous... \\n\\ngeorge: did you say dangerous? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m a bootlegger. \\n\\nanna: you\\'re a what? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m bootleggin\\' a movie, baby! \\n\\nanna: isn\\'t that illegal? \\n\\ngeorge: i can do hard time for this one. and community service! \\n\\nanna: is this your fibercon? \\n\\ngeorge: (takes it and throws it out window) get outta my way! \\n\\nkramer: jerry, george got arrested. \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nkramer: yeah. he went down at the beackman, he tried to lam, but they cheesed him. \\n\\njerry: oh now i see. (buzzer) yeah. \\n\\nbrody: brody, i\\'m comin\\' up. \\n\\njerry: what\\'re we gonna do? \\n\\nkramer: well, i ah, gotta give him something. come on, where\\'s that tape i shot? \\n\\njerry: i think that\\'s it. (they play it and see elaine dancing) sweet fancy moses! \\n\\nkramer: jerry, she taped over the whole ending! (brody enters) \\n\\nbrody: where\\'s the tape? \\n\\njerry: uh, well. it, uh... \\n\\nbrody: is that it? \\n\\nkramer: uh, yeah, yeah. here it is, brody. one copy of cry cry again. \\n\\nbrody: how\\'d it turn out? \\n\\nkramer + jerry: uh... great. \\n\\nkramer: although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there. \\n\\njerry: yeah, out of nowhere there\\'s this lone dancer who appears to be injured. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, it\\'s a disturbing image. \\n\\njerry: yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancing, you cry again. \\n\\nanna: (george is crying) it\\'s all right, george. you\\'ll just pay a fine and that\\'ll be it. \\n\\ngeorge: why did the policeman have to yell at me like that? (elaine enters) \\n\\nelaine: anna... \\n\\nanna: oh, elaine, thanks for picking me up. i can explain everything. \\n\\nelaine: all right. well, we\\'ll talk about it tomorrow at the office. (mr. costanza enters) \\n\\nfrank: okay, where\\'s my boy? \\n\\ngeorge: oh my god. \\n\\nfrank: i\\'m sitting at home, reading a periodical, and this is the call i get? my son is a bootlegger? (he hits george in the head) \\n\\ngeorge: ow! dad... \\n\\nfrank: who put you up to this, was it her? \\n\\nelaine: all right. wait a minute. i think you\\'ve got it backwards. \\n\\nfrank: my george isn\\'t clever enough to hatch a scheme like this. \\n\\nelaine: you got that right. \\n\\nfrank: what the hell does that mean? \\n\\nelaine: that means whatever the hell you want it to mean. \\n\\nfrank: you sayin\\' you want a piece of me? \\n\\nelaine: i could drop you like a bag of dirt. \\n\\nfrank: you wanna piece of me? you got it! (they begin to fight) \\n\\njerry: but he\\'s an old man, elaine. \\n\\nelaine: well, he wrote the check, and i cashed it. \\n\\njerry: (seeing a street vendor) hey, it\\'s the bootlegged death blow that i shot. \\n\\nelaine: oh, cry cry again, i wanna see that. \\n\\njerry: no you don\\'t. \\n\\nman: you shot death blow? \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\nman: that was brilliant. \\n\\njerry: thank you. (they continue walking) \\n\\nelaine: you were big. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m still big. it\\'s the bootlegs that got small. so how are things at the office? back to normal? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, pretty much. although i still get the vibe every once in a while. \\n\\njerry: i wouldn\\'t worry about it.

\\n\\ngeorge: my dad was a cook during the korean war. something very bad happened, ever since you can\\'t get him near a kitchen. \\n\\nkramer: shell-shocked? \\n\\ngeorge: oh yeah, but that has nothing to do with it. \\n\\nelaine: that\\'s good work, guys. that aught to do it for today. \\n\\neddie: wait. you didn\\'t ask me about my ideas. \\n\\nelaine: oh, eddie, well it\\'s your first day. \\n\\neddie: i\\'m ready. \\n\\nelaine: oh, okay. \\n\\neddit: (reading) it\\'s a hot night. the mind races. you think about your knife; the only friend who hasn\\'t betrayed you, the only friend who won\\'t be dead by sun up. sleep tight, mates, in your quilted chambray nightshirts. \\n\\nelaine: what am i gonna do? he is a disaster. \\n\\njerry: well, if he\\'s doing that bad, maybe he\\'s in line for another promotion. \\n\\nelaine: you know what? you are exactly right. that is what i should do, i should promote him. i\\'ll give him another office on another floor and he can sit there with his nice title and his bayonet and stop freakin\\' me out. \\n\\ngeorge: nothing at all. \\n\\ndoctor: well george, your vision is quite impaired. if you\\'ll just sign this insurance form, here\\'s a pen. \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'re a very handsome man, by the way. \\n\\njerry: what the hell is going on here? \\n\\njerry: what are you doing? \\n\\nkramer: i got three kitchens going. i got brisket going at newman\\'s, i got kugel working at mrs. zamfino\\'s, this is kreplach. here, try some of this. \\n\\njerry: no, i don\\'t want to. \\n\\nkramer: eat, eat! you\\'re skin and bones. \\n\\nkramer: hah? \\n\\njerry: oh, this is awful. \\n\\nkramer: jerry, it\\'s kreplach. it\\'s an acquired taste, yeah. \\n\\njerry: did you follow the recipe? \\n\\nkramer: the recipe was for four to six people; i had to multiply for a hundred and eighty-three people. i guess i got confused. \\n\\njerry: it tastes like dirt. \\n\\nkramer: well i also dropped it on the way over. look i\\'m in trouble, i got no skills. i can\\'t peel, i can\\'t chop, i can\\'t grate. i can\\'t mince! i got no sense of flavor, obviously. you know, i gotta talk to frank. \\n\\njerry: kramer, you can\\'t talk to frank. \\n\\nkramer: no i gotta talk to him, i know that he can help me, jerry. \\n\\nabby: i think there\\'s a dead animal in the elevator. \\n\\nkramer: my stuffed cabbage! \\n\\nabby: so, great dinner last night. \\n\\njerry: yeah, it was alright. \\n\\nabby: i told cynthia we\\'d double with her and bania saturday and then catch his act. \\n\\njerry: no. no, no way, no bania. \\n\\nabby: what? \\n\\njerry: have you seen his act? he\\'s got a twelve-minute bit about ovaltine. he\\'s a punk, a patsy, a hack. \\n\\nabby: cynthia would not date a hack. \\n\\njerry: would. does. is. \\n\\nelaine: before we get started, i am happy to tell you that eddie sherman is no longer writing for this catalog. \\n\\nelaine: he\\'s upstairs, i made him director of corporate development. \\n\\nemployee: you promoted him? \\n\\nelaine: well, no, i would hardly-- \\n\\nemployee: i bust my hump ever day. \\n\\nelaine: relax-- \\n\\nemployee: as far as i\\'m concerned, you and your deranged protg can run the catalog by yourselves! i quit! \\n\\nelaine: well, hey? hey. hey!! \\n\\nvoice: chapter one. in order to manage risk we must first understand risk. how do you spot risk? how do you avoid risk and what makes it so risky? \\n\\ngeorge: this guy sounds just like me. \\n\\nvoice: to understand risk, we must first define risk. \\n\\ngeorge: this is horrible. \\n\\nvoice: risk is defined as-- \\n\\ngeorge: (banging the recorder) stop it! stop it! \\n\\nkramer: c\\'mon frank, i need you. i mean the war was fifty years ago. \\n\\nfrank: in my mind, there\\'s a war still going on. \\n\\nkramer: alright, what happened, frank? what is it that you can\\'t get over? \\n\\nfrank: inchon, korea, 1950. i was the best cook uncle sam ever saw, slinging hash for the fighting 103rd. as we marched north, our supply lines were getting thin. one day a couple of gis found a crate, inside were six hundred pounds of prime texas steer. at least it once was prime. the use date was three weeks past, but i was arrogant, i was brash, i thought if i used just the right spices, cooked it long enough... \\n\\nkramer: what happened? \\n\\nfrank: i went too far. i over seasoned it. men were keeling over all around me. i can still hear the retching, the screaming. i sent sixteen of my own men to the latrines that night. they were just boys. \\n\\nkramer: frank, you were a boy too. and it was war. it was a crazy time for everyone. \\n\\nfrank: tell that to bobby colby. all that kid wanted to do was go home. well he went home alright, with a crater in his colon the size of a cutlet. had to sit him on a cork the eighteen-hour flight home! \\n\\nkramer: frank, now listen to me. two hundred jewish singles need you. this is your chance to make it all right again. \\n\\nfrank: no. no, i\\'ll never cook again! never! now get out of my house!! get out. go. \\n\\njerry: so you saw bania\\'s act? \\n\\nabby: he got two minutes into that ovaltine thing and i just couldn\\'t take it anymore. \\n\\njerry: i told you, it\\'s like getting beaten with a bag of oranges. \\n\\nabby: why is he so obsessed with ovaltine? \\n\\njerry: he just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny. \\n\\nabby: anyway, cynthia and i got into this big argument afterwards and i think it\\'s over. \\n\\njerry: no more mentor? \\n\\nabby: looks that way. \\n\\njerry: well at least you and i are okay again. \\n\\nabby: actually i was kind of thinking that maybe we shouldn\\'t see each other for a while. \\n\\njerry: why? \\n\\nabby: well i\\'m feeling a little disoriented. it\\'s just weird for me not to have an advisor. \\n\\njerry: i can tell you what to do. \\n\\nabby: no, it\\'s more than that. \\n\\njerry: i can tell you what to think. \\n\\nabby: i need someone i can trust. \\n\\njerry: oh. \\n\\ngeorge: i got a big problem here, jerry. the tapes are worthless. \\n\\njerry: kind of in the middle of something here, george. \\n\\njerry: george? \\n\\nabby: i gotta run anyway. \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t believe you feel you really need a mentor. \\n\\nabby: i just need someone who can give me some kind of direction. i\\'ll see ya. \\n\\njerry: yeah, see ya. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s your problem. \\n\\ngeorge: no problem. \\n\\neddie: hey, i think i got something here. the bengalese galoshes. \\n\\nelaine: oh. \\n\\neddie: (reading) it\\'s tough keeping your feet dry when you\\'re kicking in a skull. \\n\\nelaine: you know, eddie, that might be just a tad harsh for womenswear. \\n\\neddie: well, i\\'m not married to it. \\n\\neddie: dewy meadow. \\n\\nestelle: here\\'s your omelet. \\n\\nfrank: it\\'s dry. \\n\\nestelle: that\\'s the way i always make it. \\n\\nfrank: well it sucks. \\n\\nestelle: what did you say? \\n\\nfrank: your meatloaf is mushy, your salmon croquettes are oily and your eggplant parmesan is a disgrace to this house! \\n\\nestelle: well that\\'s too bad, because i\\'m the only one who cooks around here! \\n\\nfrank: not any more! gimme that spatula! i\\'m back, baby! \\n\\nabby: and you\\'re sure with your busy schedule you\\'d have time to take on a protg? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'ll make time, because abby, i was once like you; wide-eyed, naive, i didn\\'t know the first thing about a subject as fundamental as risk management. \\n\\nabby: i\\'m not familiar with that, you\\'ll have to explain it to me. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'ll tell you what, why don\\'t you read this book and let\\'s just see if you can explain it to me. \\n\\nabby: alright. \\n\\ngeorge: okay. \\n\\nbania: hey jerry. \\n\\njerry: oh, hey bania. \\n\\nbania: didja hear what happened? the mentor saw my act. she dumped me. \\n\\njerry: oh, that\\'s too bad. \\n\\nbania: maybe she\\'s right. maybe i am a complete hack. i\\'m the absolute worst. the worst, jerry. \\n\\njerry: well it\\'s just that you got so many things with the milk. you got that bosco bit then you got your nestl\\'s quik bit, by the time you get to ovaltine-- \\n\\nbania: you think you can give me a hand with my material? \\n\\nkramer: hey. \\n\\nfrank: you still need a cook? \\n\\nkramer: oh yeah, come on in, frank. \\n\\nfrank: ya got t-fal? \\n\\nkramer: keflon. \\n\\nfrank: no! follow me. \\n\\nbania: (reading) why do they call it ovaltine? the mug is round. the jar is round. they should call it round tine. that\\'s gold, jerry! gold! \\n\\nelaine: let\\'s just replace \"hail of shrapnel\" and \"scar tissue\" with \"string of pearls\" and \"raspberry scones\". \\n\\njerry: george costanza is your mentor? \\n\\nabby: yeah, he\\'s great! i am learning so much. \\n\\njerry: about what? how to calculate five percent of a restaurant check? \\n\\nabby: you know what your problem is? you just have no respect for the mentor/mentor relationship. \\n\\njerry: as a matter of fact, i happen to have a protg of my own. \\n\\nabby: who? \\n\\njerry: a mister kenneth bania. \\n\\nabby: bania? \\n\\njerry: i\\'m gonna mentor this kid to the top. \\n\\nabby: huh, well, i don\\'t think i want to date a mentor whose protg is a hack. \\n\\njerry: well, i don\\'t think i want to date a protg whose mentor is a costanza. \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t know how we did it, but there\\'s some kind of chemistry between us, we turned out one hell of a catalog. \\n\\neddie: cool. \\n\\nelaine: hey ed, let me ask you something. what\\'s with the fatigues and all the psychotic imagery? huh? \\n\\neddie: i don\\'t want to talk about it. \\n\\nelaine: come on, don\\'t be a baby. \\n\\neddie: i went out on a couple of dates with this woman, i thought she really liked me, and then things kind of cooled off. \\n\\nelaine: that\\'s it? \\n\\neddie: well it\\'s tough meeting somebody you like, let alone somebody jewish. \\n\\nelaine: mm. this food is fantastic. \\n\\njerry: have you tried the hamentashen? \\n\\nelaine: i can\\'t get off the kishkas. \\n\\nbania: hey jerry! \\n\\njerry: bania? \\n\\nbania: i just stopped by to thank you. that risk management stuff you wrote for me? it\\'s killer! \\n\\njerry: risk management? \\n\\nbania: aw, it\\'s gold, jerry! gold! i got all these corporate gigs and even cynthia took me back. \\n\\nwoman: so you went from the mailroom to the director of corporate development in two days? \\n\\neddie: that\\'s right. \\n\\nwoman: how much are they paying you? i\\'ll double it. \\n\\nkramer: ya know these latkes are going like hotcakes. \\n\\nfrank: where\\'s the powdered sugar? \\n\\nkramer: you know frank, you could take a break. \\n\\nfrank: no breaks. i fell reborn, i\\'m like a phoenix rising from arizona. \\n\\nelaine: you\\'re quitting? \\n\\neddie: i can\\'t churn out that pointless drivel any more. \\n\\nelaine: well, you can\\'t quit, you\\'re all i\\'ve got. i need you! \\n\\nvoice: our next speaker is george costanza on the subject of risk management. \\n\\ngeorge: ovaltine. have you ever had this stuff? why is it called ovaltine? \\n\\ngeorge: they should call it round tine. you know what i\\'m talking about. \\n\\nwilhelm: (proudly, to the man seated beside him) he\\'s my protg. \\n\\nfrank: noooo!!! don\\'t eat it! no good!\" \\n\\njerry: hey, have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs? pepcid ac, tagemat hb. \\n\\nelaine: ugh, the whole country\\'s sick to their stomach. \\n\\njerry: now, you know you\\'re supposed to take these things before you get sick? \\n\\nelaine: what is this, a \\'bit\\'? \\n\\njerry: no. \\n\\nelaine: \\'cos i\\'m not in the mood. \\n\\njerry: we\\'re just talking. is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? if you feel good, you\\'re supposed to take one! \\n\\nelaine: yeah, i know that tone. this is a bit. \\n\\njerry: they\\'ve opened up a whole new market. medication for the well. \\n\\nelaine: (tired) alright, are you done with your little amusement? \\n\\njerry: (hopeful) then you admit it was amusing? \\n\\nelaine: it was okay, but move the \\'medication for the well\\' to the front, and hit the word \\'good\\' harder. \\n\\njerry: (thinking) great. thanks. \\n\\nelaine: so, your firm designed all the furniture in here? \\n\\nbrett: we manufacture it. the original designs are by karl farbman. \\n\\nelaine: (as if she knows) oh, farbman. \\n\\nbrett: you know farbman? \\n\\nelaine: mm, love farbman. \\n\\nbrett: most people go their whole lives without sitting in a farbman. \\n\\nelaine: wuh, if you call that living. (laughs) ahaha. \\n\\nelaine: wouldn\\'t it be great if farbman designed shoes? \\n\\nelaine: brett? don\\'t you think that would be great? \\n\\nelaine: brett? \\n\\nbrett: (still staring off) after the song, babe. \\n\\nelaine: huh? \\n\\nbrett: the song. \\n\\njerry: so when do i meet this jerk? \\n\\nelaine: he\\'s not a jerk, jer. he only works with karl farbman. \\n\\njerry: who? \\n\\nelaine: (dismissive) i dunno, some designer. anyway, brett is so generous, and sensitive. last night he was moved just listening to a song. \\n\\njerry: what song? \\n\\nelaine: desperado. \\n\\njerry: desperado? \\n\\nelaine: uh huh. \\n\\njerry: and you\\'re still dating him? i tell you who sounds a little desperado. \\n\\njerry: (pointing toward the guy) see that salesman, twirling that umbrella. \\n\\nelaine: uh huh. \\n\\njerry: i invented that. \\n\\nelaine: that, had to be invented? \\n\\njerry: when i started out as a comedian, i sold umbrellas. it was my idea to twirl it, to attract customers. \\n\\nelaine: (skeptical) oh hoh, really? well, why don\\'t we ask him about it? \\n\\njerry: elaine. \\n\\nelaine: excuse me. hey, how you doing. uhm, my, uh, friend here says that he invented that little twirl you\\'re doing. \\n\\njerry: elaine, please, it was a long time ago. the man doesn\\'t want a history lesson. \\n\\nclicky: teddy padillac came up with this twirl. \\n\\nelaine: (looking at jerry) ohh. \\n\\njerry: i know teddy padillac. i worked with him on forty-eighth and sixth. \\n\\nclicky: yeah, that\\'s where he come up with it. \\n\\njerry: in his dreams. \\n\\nelaine: alright, can we (glances at her watch) go? \\n\\njerry: (to clicky) by the way, you\\'re doing it too fast. you\\'ll disorient the customers. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s the twirling that dazzles the eye. \\n\\ngeorge: (pulls a face) i find it disorienting. who buys an umbrella anyway? y..you get \\'em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans. \\n\\njerry: (as if speaking to a moron) those belong to people. \\n\\nkramer: hey. well.

(sits beside jerry) they\\'re known as gift-givers. and tonight we\\'re going dancing at the rainbow room. \\n\\njerry: sounds like you\\'re throwing a lot of their money around. \\n\\nkramer: well, jerry, they\\'re japanese. i mean, that tv you watch, that sushi you eat, i mean, even that kimono you wear. where to you think all that money goes, hmm? \\n\\nkramer: that\\'s right. \\n\\ngeorge: how\\'d you hook up with these guys? \\n\\nkramer: well, they recognised jerry from the super terrific happy hour. see now, you should be doing your own show in japan. now, they get you. \\n\\njerry: what kind of show am i gonna do in japan? \\n\\nkramer: (to george) alright, what\\'d you do with that pilot you did. \\n\\ngeorge: (excited) yeah, the pilot! \\n\\nkramer: that\\'s right, i think that had marvellous production values. \\n\\ngeorge: (enthusiastic) and, you know, i do a lotta business with japanese tv. they broadcast a lot of american baseball. they got an office here in new york! \\n\\njerry: forget it! the pilot was awful. it failed. \\n\\ngeorge: (animated) it failed here! because, here, every time you turn on a tv, all you see is four morons sitting round an apartment, whining about their dates! \\n\\nkramer: george is right, jerry. see, here, you\\'re just another apple, but in japan, you\\'re an exotic fruit. like an orange. which is rare there. \\n\\ntv jerry: you had a date? you went out with my butler?! who said you could go out with my butler?! \\n\\ntv elaine: well, why do i need your permission? \\n\\ntv jerry: because he\\'s my butler. \\n\\ngeorge: (eager) so? what d\\'you think? \\n\\nexecutive 1: we\\'re bit confused. why was this man jerry\\'s butler? \\n\\ngeorge: ah. you see, the man who was the butler, uh, had gotten into a car accident with jerry, and because he didn\\'t have any insurance, the judge decreed that the man become jerry\\'s butler. \\n\\nexecutive 1: is this customary in your legal system? \\n\\njerry: no. that\\'s what makes it such a humorous situation. \\n\\nexecutive 1: (speaks japanese) subtitle are you following any of this? \\n\\nexecutive 2: (speaks japanese) subtitle i\\'m still trying to figure out why they gave us a bag of oranges. \\n\\nexecutive 1: (to jerry and george) i\\'m sorry. i\\'m sure mr seinfeld is very funny to americans, but i\\'m not sure this butler show would work in japan. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, i, uh, i disagree. you\\'ve, uh, you\\'ve been living in america too long. (indicates the bag of oranges) you\\'ve forgotten what it\\'s like to have no oranges. \\n\\nexecutive 1: (speaks japanese) subtitle again with the oranges \\n\\njerry: (flexing his fingers) sorry. my hand is numb. \\n\\ngeorge: (positive) yes. from endorsing checks for the super terrific happy hour.

(sounding very much like jerry) \\n\\nelaine: alright, lets give it a shot, lets go. \\n\\njerry: giddee up! \\n\\nnewman: it\\'s getting cold, it\\'s getting cold. \\n\\nkramer: that was a close one. \\n\\nnewman: well why do we have to keep this from jerry? \\n\\nkramer: because if jerry finds out that i\\'m hooked on roger\\'s chicken i\\'m back there with the red menace. \\n\\nipswitch: ms. benes the hat you charged to the company was sable, this is nutria. \\n\\nelaine: w-w- well, that\\'s a -ah, its kind of sable. \\n\\nipswitch: no, its a kind of rat. \\n\\nelaine: that\\'s a rat hat? \\n\\nipswitch: and a poorly made one, even by rat hat standards. i have no choice but to recommend your prompt termination to the board of directors. nothing short of the approval of peterman himself will save you this time. \\n\\nelaine: but, but, he\\'s in the burmese jungle. \\n\\nipswitch: and quite mad too from what i hear. \\n\\nelaine: wait a minute, wait a minute. can i fire you? \\n\\nipswitch: no. \\n\\nkramer: so heather called? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, but get this, the message said \\'call me if you have the time\\'. heh heh if i have the time, you get it? \\n\\nkramer: no, but this is all very exciting. (sounding very much like jerry) \\n\\ngeorge: she knows that i have her clock. i know that she has my hat. i think she\\'s getting ready to make an exchange. \\n\\nkramer: well there is the possibility that you\\'ve gone right out of your mind. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'ve looked at that, seems unlikely. \\n\\nkramer: i\\'d look again. so ah, how come you didn\\'t call jerry about all this? \\n\\ngeorge: jerry, i can\\'t talk to jerry anymore. ever since he moved into that apartment he\\'s too much ... like you. \\n\\nkramer: hmm. that\\'s a shame. \\n\\njerry: seth, you\\'re the manager, can\\'t you turn off that sign? \\n\\nseth: jerry i lied. i\\'m just an assistant manager. \\n\\nseth: (on loud speaker) number sixty seven, family feast. \\n\\nnewman: number 67, right here, right here! \\n\\njerry: hello newman. \\n\\nnewman: hello jerry. \\n\\nseth: and don\\'t forget your steamed broccoli. \\n\\njerry: hold it. broccoli? newman, you wouldn\\'t eat broccoli if it was deep fried in chocolate sauce. \\n\\nnewman: i love.. broccoli, its, good for you. \\n\\njerry: really? then maybe you\\'d like to have a piece? \\n\\nnewman: gladly.

(laughs) \\n\\npeterman: are you an assassin? \\n\\nelaine: i - i work for your mail order catalog. \\n\\npeterman: you\\'re an errand girl, sent by grocery clerks, to collect a bill. \\n\\nelaine: well actually um, i do have a bill here. if you could just sign, this expense form, i think i could still make the last fan boat out of here. \\n\\npeterman: i\\'d be happy to elaine (he starts reading the form as she hands him a pen)... but i will have to see this hat. \\n\\nelaine: right... (nodding) \\n\\ngeorge: so how do you want to do this? \\n\\nheather: alright george, i\\'ll be honest. the first time we went out, i found you very irritating. but after seeing you a couple of times, you sorta got stuck in my head, (sings) ca-stan-za!

(holds lettuce head) okay, from what i know about you, your brain consists of two parts the intellect, represented here (pulls off tiny piece of lettuce), and the part obsessed with sex. (shows large piece) now granted, you have extracted an astonishing amount from this little scrap. but with no-sex-louise, this previously useless lump, is now functioning for the first time in its existence. (eats tiny piece of lettuce) \\n\\ngeorge: oh my god. i just remembered where i left my retainer in second grade. i\\'ll see ya. (he throws finished rubik\\'s cube to jerry and he exits. kramer enters) \\n\\nkramer: need some more matches. \\n\\njerry: what is goin\\' on in there? \\n\\nkramer: i met some people smoking on the street, so i invited them up to my apartment to smoke. \\n\\njerry: why? \\n\\nkramer: well somebody had to. you know, just because a person\\'s a smoker, that doesn\\'t mean he\\'s not a human being. \\n\\njerry: it doesn\\'t? \\n\\nkramer: well you can confine them, you can punish them, you can cram them into the corner, but they\\'re not going away, jerry. \\n\\njerry: all right. \\n\\nkramer: yeah. \\n\\nelaine: so when they\\'re handing you those cadavers, do you get to choose whether it\\'s a man or a woman? \\n\\nben: i dunno. dead bodies really gross me out. (sue ellen mischke enters with a man) \\n\\nelaine: oh my god. \\n\\nben: what\\'s wrong? \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s sue ellen mischke, this old braless friend i hate. (elaine tries to cover her face) \\n\\nsue ellen: elaine? hi. \\n\\nelaine: oh hi, sue ellen. \\n\\nsue ellen: oh rick, this is an old, old, friend of mine, elaine benes. rick is a periodontist. he does giuliani\\'s gums. \\n\\nelaine: well, this is my boyfriend, doctor ben gelfen. \\n\\nben: well, i\\'m an intern. \\n\\nelaine: hey, stop kidding me. he\\'s a doctor. he\\'s a very good doctor. \\n\\nwoman: carlitto\\'s just passed out. can anyone help? \\n\\nelaine: well, there\\'s a doctor right here. \\n\\nben: no there\\'s not. \\n\\nelaine: can\\'t you at least tell him what to do? \\n\\nben: like what? \\n\\nsue ellen: shouldn\\'t he elevate his legs? \\n\\nben: right. elevate your legs! \\n\\nelaine: i hope carlitto feels better. ben really wishes he could\\'ve helped. \\n\\nlarry: i thought he was a doctor. \\n\\nelaine: oh he is. kind of. i mean, i call him doctor. (she walks away and sees george sitting down reading books) george. (he holds up his hand to signal her to wait a second.) \\n\\ngeorge: of course. absolute zero! \\n\\nelaine: what? what is with all these books? \\n\\ngeorge: i stopped having sex. \\n\\nkramer: all right, i\\'ll see ya bill. all right, i got room for two, but the only thing i have is in the non-filter section. (jerry enters) hey. \\n\\njerry: hey. wh-what\\'d you got, a smoker\\'s lounge in there? \\n\\nkramer: oh yeah, people really seem to be enjoying themselves. you know, they come in once, it\\'s like they\\'re addicted. (katie enters) \\n\\nkatie: jerry, oh there you are. you didn\\'t answer the phone. \\n\\njerry: i was out. \\n\\nkatie: oh. jerry, great news. i got you an assembly. \\n\\njerry: an assembly? \\n\\nkatie: two hours in front of the entire junior high, grades six through eight. that\\'s six grade, seventh grade-- \\n\\njerry: i understand. but what am i gonna talk about for two hours? \\n\\nkatie: and, it is already in the school paper. they cancelled rick james. \\n\\njerry: superfreak? \\n\\nkatie: yes. \\n\\nelaine: what is your answer to number 74? \\n\\nben: medobolic acidosis. \\n\\nelaine: no! hypocalimia, not medibolic acidosis. duh! \\n\\nben: man, i\\'m never gonna pass this thing. \\n\\nelaine: oh yes you are. we\\'ll just stop having sex. \\n\\ngeorge: guys, hitting is not about muscle. it\\'s simple physics. calculate the velocity, v, in relation to the trajectory, t, in which g, gravity, of course remains a constant. (hits a home run) it\\'s not complicated. \\n\\njeter: now who are you again? \\n\\ngeorge: george costanza, assistant to the traveling secretary. \\n\\nwilliams: are you the guy who put us in that ramada in milwaukee? \\n\\ngeorge: do you wanna talk about hotels, or do you wanna win some ball games? \\n\\njeter: we won the world series. \\n\\ngeorge: in six games. \\n\\njerry: ...so if you like to tell jokes, and love to make people laugh, stand-up comedy may be the career for you. \\n\\ngeorge: nine minutes. \\n\\njerry: how am i gonna fill two hours? \\n\\ngeorge: hello? i can take an hour off your hands. give the kids a chance to see a real live yankee. \\n\\njerry: and give you the chance to see some real disappointed kids. (waitress comes to table) \\n\\nwaitress: more coffee? \\n\\ngeorge: excuse me, darling, do i detect a portuguese accent? \\n\\nwaitress: si \\n\\ngeorge: das kaffes un salat e grand por favor. \\n\\nwaitress: mute pragalas senor \\n\\ngeorge: eh, don\\'t mention it. \\n\\nelaine: portuguese? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, my cleaning lady\\'s portuguese. i must\\'ve picked it up. \\n\\nelaine: how come he\\'s gettin\\' so smart? i stopped having sex with ben three days ago and i don\\'t know no portuguese? \\n\\njerry: are you all right? \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t know. it\\'s just the last coupla days my mind has been, not good. \\n\\njerry: wait a second, i know what\\'s happening. the no sex thing is having a reverse effect on you. \\n\\nelaine: what? what are you talking about? \\n\\njerry: to a woman, sex is like the garbage man. you just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit\\'s gonna come along and pick it up. but now, it\\'s like a garbage strike. the bags are piling up in your head. the sidewalk is blocked. nothing\\'s getting through. you\\'re stupid. \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t understand. \\n\\njerry: exactly. \\n\\nkramer: hey buddy. \\n\\njerry: hey. \\n\\nkramer: hey, you should come over. tonight\\'s pipe night. \\n\\njerry: what? what happened to your face? it looks like an old catcher\\'s mitt. \\n\\nkramer: what? (kramer checks it out.) my face is all craggly, it\\'s crinkly. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s from all that smoke. you\\'ve experienced a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. what did you expect? \\n\\nkramer: emphysema, birth defects, cancer. but not this. jerry, my face is my livelihood. everything i have i owe to this face. \\n\\njerry: and your teeth, your teeth are all brown. \\n\\nkramer: look away, i\\'m hideous. \\n\\nelaine: hey, ben. i need a four letter word. winnie the blank. \\n\\nben: pooh! \\n\\nelaine: pooh...(laughing) \\n\\nben: no, it\\'s winnie the pooh. \\n\\nlouise: so the hospital called, turns out some stupid intern screwed up my test. i never had mono. so we can... you know. \\n\\njerry: so what did you do? \\n\\ngeorge: i told her i would have to think about it. \\n\\njerry: but ultimately, you\\'re gonna choose in favor of sex, right? \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t know. perhaps i can better serve the world this way. \\n\\njerry: you mean, not subjecting yourself to your sexual advances. \\n\\ngeorge: simple joke from a simple man. \\n\\njerry: so you\\'re never gonna have sex again? \\n\\ngeorge: well, jerry. there was a pretty good chance i was never gonna have sex again anyway. \\n\\njerry: so you ready for the assembly tomorrow? you know what you\\'re gonna say about the yankees? \\n\\ngeorge: oh, sports are so pedestrian. i\\'ve prepared some science experiments that will illuminate the mind and dazzle the eye. \\n\\njerry: i wrote a 20 minute bit about how homework stinks. \\n\\njackie: my vacation was restful, splendid, magnificent. in fact, next time i\\'m plannin\\' on going to kofu. \\n\\njackie: oh no. \\n\\nkramer: jackie we gotta talk. \\n\\njackie: no way, kramer. you\\'ve brought nothing but a mountain of misfortune and humiliation. now get out. \\n\\nkramer: but jackie-- \\n\\njackie: i said out. \\n\\nkramer: jackie, i think i gotta case against the tobacco companies. \\n\\njackie: the who? \\n\\nkramer: the tobacco companies. \\n\\njackie: i\\'ve been wanting a piece of them for years. \\n\\njackie: did that cigarette warning label mention anything about damage to your appearance? \\n\\nkramer: no, it didn\\'t say anything. \\n\\njackie: so you\\'re a victim. now your face is shallow, unattractive, disgusting. \\n\\nkramer: so jackie, do you think we gotta case? \\n\\njackie: your face is my case. \\n\\njerry: how ya doin\\'? \\n\\nelaine: not good. i\\'m a moron. \\n\\njerry: well, don\\'t worry about it. once he passes the test, you\\'ll have sex again, and you\\'ll be fine. \\n\\nelaine: well, that kinda brings us to why i\\'m here. you got eleven minutes? \\n\\njerry: what for? oh come on. \\n\\nelaine: i just wanna clear my head. it has nothing to do with you. \\n\\njerry: i think it has something to do with me. \\n\\nelaine: you could read the paper through the whole thing if you want. \\n\\njerry: (thinks about it for a second as to reconsider) no, no, no. i\\'m sorry, it\\'s too weird. \\n\\nelaine: oh, all right. is kramer home? \\n\\ngeorge: you know, louise. i think you\\'ll find this amusing. in early euclidean geometry-- \\n\\nlouise: george, i have to have sex. \\n\\ngeorge: i used to share that same outlook. but now, i have so many things to occupy my mind. for instance, the atom. \\n\\nlouise: goodbye, george. i hate you. (she leaves) \\n\\ngeorge: what a fascinating turn of events. (waitress approaches) \\n\\nwaitress: mas caf? \\n\\ngeorge: si, por favor. \\n\\njackie: miss wilkie, your tobacco company has turned this beautiful specimen, into a horrible twisted freak. \\n\\nkramer: who could love me? \\n\\nwilkie: i disagree. in fact, i feel mr. kramer projects a rugged masculinity. \\n\\njackie: rugged? the man\\'s a goblin. he\\'s only been exposed to smoke for four days. by the time this case gets to trial, he\\'ll be nothing more than a shrunken head. \\n\\nwilkie: all right, mr. chiles. you\\'ll have our offer by tomorrow. good day, gentlemen. (she exits) \\n\\nkramer: bye-bye. jackie, you did it. we\\'re rich. \\n\\njackie: you better believe it. jackie\\'s cashin\\' in on your wretched disfigurement. \\n\\nelaine: congratulations! you passed! \\n\\nben: elaine, elaine. i don\\'t think we should see each other anymore. \\n\\nelaine: what? you\\'re breaking up with me? but i sacrificed and supported you while you struggled. what about my dream of dating a doctor? \\n\\nben: i\\'m sorry, elaine. i always knew that after i became a doctor, i would dump whoever i was with and find someone better. that\\'s the dream of becoming a doctor. \\n\\nelaine: look it, are we going to have sex, or not? \\n\\nkatie: okay, jerry, now when the glee club\\'s finished singing, george goes on, then you. (george enters) \\n\\ngeorge: hey. \\n\\njerry: where have you been? you know, you\\'re on next. \\n\\ngeorge: i got lost on the way over. \\n\\njerry: got lost? we went to school here for three years. \\n\\ngeorge: what are these? (holds test tubes to his head like antennae) take me to your leader. \\n\\njerry: oh my god. you had sex. you had sex with louise! \\n\\ngeorge: no, the portuguese waitress. \\n\\njerry: the portuguese waitress? \\n\\ngeorge: i calculated my odds of ever getting together with a portuguese waitress. mathematically, i had to do it, jerry. \\n\\nkatie: george, george, you\\'re on. \\n\\ngeorge: no, no. i\\'m not going on. \\n\\njerry: then what\\'d you come down here for? \\n\\ngeorge: tell you about the portuguese waitress. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s good to have you back. \\n\\nkatie: one of you has to go on. \\n\\njerry: all right, i\\'ll do it. (goes on stage) hey kids. what\\'s the deal with homework? you\\'re not working on your home! (audience boos) \\n\\nkramer: it was a great lunch, jackie. thanks. \\n\\njackie: it\\'s a little puzzling we haven\\'t gotten that offer yet. \\n\\nkramer: mrs. wilkie, from the tobacco company called me. we had a little pow-wow. \\n\\njackie: a pow-wow? who told you to have a pow-wow? i didn\\'t tell you to have pow-wow. \\n\\nkramer: she made an offer. i took it. \\n\\njackie: how much? \\n\\nkramer: no, no, no. there was no money. \\n\\njackie: no money? then what\\'d we get? \\n\\nkramer: check it out. (they see a marlboro man billboard with kramer on it) \\n\\njackie: this is the most public yet of my many humiliations. \\n\\njerry: cancelled? but i was supposed to be on tomorrow night. \\n\\nletterman: yeah, but then, you know, some people were telling me about that little flap out there at the junior high assembly. and before that, you were bumped by a lizard? \\n\\njerry: actually, it was a ********. \\n\\nletterman: those things, deadly dangerous. a long time ago my uncle and a date are driving, like, through mexico. they see one on the road, drags him out of the road, and chews his face off. listen, we\\'ll call you if anything opens up. okay, jimmy? \\n\\njerry: jerry. \\n\\nletterman: right. jerry. \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\ngeorge: jerry! (slams the door) georgie\\'s moving out! \\n\\njerry: (gets up) get out! \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m out! fantastic apartment right across from mine, huh. i can\\'t wait for you to see it. \\n\\njerry: (looks around his apartment) is it better than mine? \\n\\ngeorge: (definite) oh yeah. \\n\\njerry: so, it\\'s a two-bedroom-one-bath-make-your-friends-hate-ya? \\n\\ngeorge: you know what? it\\'s better than elaine\\'s, too. i gotta give her a call. (moves tward the phone) \\n\\njerry: she\\'s out. \\n\\ngeorge: (stops) oh right, the blind date. \\n\\njerry: yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up now. i guess the blind people don\\'t like being associated with all those losers. \\n\\ngeorge: come on. come check out my new place. it\\'ll take you two minutes. \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t. i\\'m meeting kramer down at my mini-storage. \\n\\ngeorge: (gloating) hey, you got any extra furniture down there? i need some more stuff to fill that extra bedroom with the walk-in closet. (smiles) \\n\\njerry: (grabs his coat) oh, this is really annoying. \\n\\ngeorge: (laughs as they leave) it\\'s working already! (both exit) \\n\\n[setting: manhattan mini-storage] \\n\\njerry: (disgusted) what is with that?! \\n\\nkramer: well, it\\'s coughing, jerry. it expells the diseased germs out of the body, into the air. (makes a guesture of germs being in the air) \\n\\njerry: (takes out his key to unlock the unit door) where is your key? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, well, uh, newman. he\\'s - he\\'s got it. \\n\\njerry: you know, kramer, i rented out half of my space to you. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, and i rented out half that space to newman. (starts coughing again) \\n\\njerry: (picks one up) mail bags? he\\'s storing mail in here? \\n\\nkramer: (looks at the bags on the floor) evidently. \\n\\n[setting: george\\'s new apartment] \\n\\nricardi: excuse me, george? (h1) \\n\\ngeorge: (looks at her) yeah, uh, no menus. (waves her off) \\n\\nricardi: (moves into the apartment, hand out) no, i\\'m mrs. ricardi - president of the tenant\\'s association. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, right! (shakes her hand) right! hey, hey.. i love the floors in here. it\\'s like a gymnasium in here! try and guard me! (dribbles an imaginary ball \\n\\nricardi: no, no.. (laughs nervously) uh, george, unfortunately, clarance eldridge in 8c has decided that he wants the apartment. \\n\\ngeorge: (let down) yeah, but you - you promised it to me. \\n\\nricardi: yes, but, you see - mister eldridge is an andrea doria survivor. and, in light of the terrible suffering that he\\'s already been through, we\\'ve decided to give it to him. \\n\\ngeorge: (depressed) well,.. the andrea doria.. that was quite a fire. (moves to the door, leaving) \\n\\nricardi: (correcting) shipwreck. \\n\\ngeorge: i remember.. (leaves) \\n\\n[setting: restaurant] \\n\\nelaine: where is this guy?! (checks her watch) i hate this! (sighs) i shoulda brought something to read.. (picks up a sugar packet) \"cancer in labratory animals\".. huh. \\n\\nwaiter: excuse me, elaine benes? \\n\\nelaine: yeah? \\n\\nwaiter: an alan mercer called for you. he said he\\'s sorry, but he won\\'t be able to make it tonight. (pause) he\\'s been stabbed. \\n\\nelaine: (shocked) stabbed?! \\n\\nwaiter: more bread? \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\njerry: (talking to elaine) you ate more bread? \\n\\nelaine: that is not the point! the guy was stabbed! \\n\\njerry: did you find out who stabbed him? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, (nodding) it turns out it was his ex-girlfriend. \\n\\njerry: (like a father) well, you\\'re not going near this hooligan anymore. \\n\\nelaine: well, i don\\'t know.. i mean, think about it, jerry. there must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion. (obviously turned on by the stabbing) i mean, to be stab-worthy.. you know, it\\'s.. kind of a compliment. \\n\\njerry: (sarcastic) yeah, too bad he didn\\'t get shot. he could have been the one. \\n\\nkramer: (coughs) hey. how\\'s everybody? (moves to the kitchen) \\n\\njerry and elaine: hey. \\n\\nkramer: ehh.. (picks up a carton of food) no expiration date on this.. (opens it, then starts coughing directly onto the food) \\n\\njerry: there is now. kramer, you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor. \\n\\nkramer: (shrugging it off) nah, no, no, no. no doctors for me. a bunch of lackeys and yes-men all towing the company line.. (looks at jerry, then leans in so elaine can\\'t hear) plus, the botched my vasectimy. \\n\\njerry: (in awe. whispering) the botched it? \\n\\nkramer: (complaining) i\\'m even more potent now! \\n\\ngeorge: hey. \\n\\njerry: hey. how\\'s the new place?! \\n\\ngeorge: gone. (moves over to a chair in the living room. kramer takes the carton of food to the table, and begins eating) the tenant association made me give it to this guy because he was an andrea doria survivor.. \\n\\nelaine: andrea doria? isn\\'t that the one they did the song about? \\n\\njerry: (correcting her) edmund fitzgerald. \\n\\nelane: i love edmund fitzgerald\\'s voice. \\n\\njerry: (gives elaine a look) no, gordon lightfoot was the singer. edmund fitzgerald was the ship. \\n\\ngeorge: (talking about his would-be apartment) you could fit 15 people in that bathroom.. \\n\\nelaine: i think gordon lightfoot was the boat. \\n\\njerry: (sarcastic) yeah, and it was rammed by the cat stevens. \\n\\nkramer: (like a teacher) the andrea doria collided with the stockholm in dense fog 21 miles off the coast of nantucket. (makes a clicking sound with his tongue) \\n\\ngeorge: how do you know? \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s in my book - \"astonishing tales of the sea\" 51 people died. \\n\\ngeorge: 51 people?! that\\'s it?! i thought it was, like, a thousand! \\n\\nkramer: there were 1,650 survivors. \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s no tragedy! how many people do you lose on a normal cruse? 30? 40?! kramer, can i take a look at that book? (starts walking tward the door. kramer grabs his food, and follows) \\n\\nkramer: oh yeah. i also got \"astounding bear attacks\" \\n\\njerry: hey, uh, before you go, did you talk to newman about getting that mail outta there? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, oh, yeah. yeah, he\\'s not gonna do it. (leaves) \\n\\n[setting: newman\\'s apartment] \\n\\njerry: newman? \\n\\nnewman: (eyes glued to the tv) i guess. \\n\\njerry: listen, i want you to get the mail outta my storage unit. \\n\\nnewman: sometimes we don\\'t get what we want. \\n\\njerry: (confused) what are you talking about? \\n\\nnewman: i didn\\'t get my transfer. \\n\\njerry: \"transfer\"? \\n\\nnewman: to hawaii. the most sought-after postal route of them all. the air is so dewy-sweet you don\\'t even have to like the stamps.. but it\\'s not to be - so, i\\'m hanging it up. \\n\\njerry: you quit the post office? \\n\\nnewman: kind of. i\\'m still collecting checks, i\\'m just not delivering mail. \\n\\njerry: well, get it out of my storage. it\\'s illegal. \\n\\nnewman: and yet, it\\'s perfectly legal to take a man\\'s soul and crush it out like a stale pall mall. \\n\\njerry: (cheerfully) well, a law\\'s a law. (leaves) \\n\\n[setting: central park] \\n\\nkramer: ok, hold on there.. that\\'s a nasty cough you got there, huh? \\n\\nman: what cough? \\n\\n[setting: restaurant] \\n\\nelaine: i love shrimp! (waves her knife around as she\\'s talking) i\\'m a shrimp eater. you put shrimp infront of me, (waves her knife along with her hand gestures. alan is getting edgy about it, and even more so with every wave) and i will eat it until my stomach pops! (notices alan\\'s unsettled) oh.. (puts the knife down) \\n\\nalan: no, it\\'s okay. i\\'m.. still just a little bit jumpy. \\n\\nelaine: (leans in close) between you and me, what happened there with the stabbing? \\n\\nalan: just.. one of those things, you know. \\n\\nelaine: what? was she just so crazy in love with you that she just couldn\\'t take it anymore? or..? \\n\\nalan: i don\\'t know. could be. \\n\\ncarol: alan?! \\n\\nalan: carol? \\n\\nelaine: (gets up, pointing after carol) was that the one?! was that the one who stabbed you?! \\n\\nalan: (between screams) no, that was a different girl. \\n\\n[setting: coffee shop] \\n\\njerry: there was another crazed ex-girlfriend? \\n\\nelaine: right, so, i called my friend, you know - the one who set us up - i found out, he\\'s a bad-breaker-upper. \\n\\njerry: mmm.. bad how? \\n\\nelaine: (fast) well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don\\'t mean? well, he says the mean things you don\\'t mean, but he means them. \\n\\njerry: (nods) i follow. so what are you gonna do? \\n\\nelaine: dump him. i can\\'t be with someone who doesn\\'t break up nicely. i mean, to me, that\\'s one of the most important parts of a relationship. \\n\\njerry: (agreeing) what\\'s more important? \\n\\n[setting: nyc street] \\n\\nkramer: (between coughs) hey. \\n\\ngeorge: what\\'s with the dog? \\n\\nkramer: (petting smuckers) yeah, this is smuckers. i borrowed him. (starts coughing) \\n\\ngeorge: oh.. \\n\\nkramer: (pointing at the dog) yeah, we share the same affliction, so i\\'m gonna have a vet check us out. \\n\\ngeorge: a vet? \\n\\nkramer: oh, i\\'ll take a vet over an m.d. any day. they gotta be able to cure a (snaps his fingers in rhythm with his words) lizard, a chicken, a pig, a frog (stops snapping) - all on the same day. \\n\\ngeorge: so, if i may jump ahead - you\\'re gonna take dog medicine? \\n\\nkramer: (smiling) you bet we are! huh, smuckers? (smuckers coughs. they turn to leave) i\\'ll see ya. \\n\\n[setting: george\\'s apartment building] \\n\\ngeorge: ahoy! mr. eldridge. i understand you were on the andrea doria. \\n\\neldridge: yes, it was a terrifying ordeal. \\n\\ngeorge: i tell ya, i hear people really stuff themselves on those cruise ships. (laughs) the buffet, that\\'s the real ordeal, huh, clarence? (laughs) \\n\\neldridge: (defensively) we had to abandon ship. \\n\\ngeorge: well, all vacations have to end eventually. \\n\\neldridge: the boat sank. \\n\\ngeorge: (holding up kramer\\'s book) according to this, it took.. 10 hours. it eased into the water like an old man into a nice warm bath - no offence. (pause) so, uh, clarence, how about abandoning this apartment, and letting me shove off in this beauty? \\n\\neldridge: is that what this is all about?! i don\\'t think i like you. (enters his apartment, and slams the door behind him) \\n\\ngeorge: (yelling out) it\\'s my apartment, eldridge! the stalkholm may not have sunk ya, but i will! ha, ha, ha! \\n\\n[setting: vet\\'s office] \\n\\nvet: what are the symptoms? \\n\\nkramer: well, uh.. it hurts when he swallows. expecially when he drinks orange juice. (vet gives him a look) i mean, uh.. dog food.. juice. (adding) what\\'s worse - he has a nagging cough. (smucker\\'s coughs) yeah, that\\'s it. that\\'s it. \\n\\nvet: yeah, well, uh - we\\'ve been seeing a lot of this lately. been drinking from the toilet? \\n\\nkramer: (offended) what? no. that\\'s disgusting.. \\n\\n[setting: coffee shop] \\n\\nalan: so that\\'s it? we\\'re, uh, we\\'re breakin\\' up? \\n\\nelaine: (confused by his sudden change-of-heart) what? break-up? we went out on one date. \\n\\nalan: (fast) ok, yeah, sure, fine, right. whatever you say. \\n\\nelaine: (shows no sign that she cares) alright, good. good. \\n\\nalan: ok, then, well, so.. see ya around.. big head. (gets up to leave) \\n\\nelaine: pardon? \\n\\nalan: you got a big head. it\\'s too big for your body. (walks for the door) \\n\\nelaine: (laughing out loud) that\\'s it?! (laughs again) that\\'s the best you got?! (laughs loudly as alan exits) \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\ngeorge: so, he\\'s keeping the apartment. he doesn\\'t deserve it, though! even if he did suffer, that was, like, 40 years ago! what has he been doing lately?! i\\'ve been suffering for the past 30 years up to and including yesterday! \\n\\njerry: you know, if this tenant board is so impressed with suffering, maybe you should tell them the \"astonishing tales of costanza\". \\n\\ngeorge: (interested) i should! \\n\\njerry: i mean, your body of work in this field is unparalleled. \\n\\ngeorge: i could go bumper to bumper with any one else on this planet! \\n\\njerry: you\\'re the man! \\n\\nnewman: jerry! \\n\\njerry: i\\'m with people, i\\'ll be with you in a moment. (slams the door on newman\\'s face. then tries to delay talking to newman by keeping the conversation with george going) so, you want a protein shake, or something? \\n\\ngeorge: nah, i guess i should really get moving on this, huh? i\\'m gonna go. (opens the door, letting newman in. leaves) \\n\\njerry: (angered) hello.. newman. \\n\\nnewman: (urgent) i need that mail, where is it?! \\n\\njerry: what\\'s the difference? \\n\\nnewman: the guy who had the hawaii transfer got busted for hoarding victoria secret catalogues. i gotta deliver that mail! \\n\\njerry: well, go ahead. there\\'s 8 bags of it. \\n\\nnewman: blast! there\\'s no way i can handle 8 in addition to my ususal load of one! i\\'ll never get to hawaii! (moves over to jerry\\'s couch, depressed) i\\'ll be stuck in this apartment building forever! (lays down on jerry\\'s couch) the dream is dead. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re giving up that easy? \\n\\nnewman: i usually do. (gets up to leave) see ya. \\n\\njerry: (stopping him) no, wait a minute, newman! you can\\'t let this dream die. you moving away is my dream too! \\n\\nnewman: (intrigued) what are you proposing? \\n\\njerry: (fast) whatever it takes, for as long as it takes me, where ever it takes me as long as it takes you away from me! \\n\\nnewman: an alliance? \\n\\njerry: (confirming) an alliance. (they both shake hands and laugh evily) now get the hell outta here. (newman leaves) \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\nelaine: hawaii? that\\'s why you\\'re helping newman with the mail? \\n\\njerry: (like an army general) elaine, newman is my sworn enemy. and he lives down the hall from my home - my home, elaine! where i sleep, where i come to play with my toys. \\n\\nelaine: well, anyway, get this i spoke to alan. you know, i told him i didn\\'t want to see him anymore.. he called me \"big head\". \\n\\njerry: \"big head\" (scoffs) that\\'s almost a compliment. \\n\\nelaine: (agreeing) it\\'s one of the nicest things anyone\\'s ever said to me. \\n\\njerry: hello? \\n\\ngeorge: (on the other line) hey. \\n\\njerry: hey, george. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, listen, i can\\'t make it later. \\n\\njerry: you can\\'t make it? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, the tenant association has decided to hear my side of the story. so, uh, i gotta kinda get ready. i\\'ll see ya. \\n\\njerry: alright. (hangs up) \\n\\nelaine: is he not gonna go to the coffee shop? \\n\\njerry: (saddened) doesn\\'t look like it\\'s gonna happen. \\n\\nelaine: (gives a \"that\\'s a shame\" face) alright, well, i\\'ll see ya. (opens the door to exit. kramer enters coughing. elaine does her best to dodge out of the way of kramer\\'s coughs, then walks off) \\n\\njerry: kramer, aren\\'t you taking any medication for that? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, yeah. (pulls a bottle out of his pocket) i got some pilss. they taste terrible. \\n\\njerry: (takes the bottle from him) just swallow \\'em. \\n\\nkramer: (gestures to his throat) no, my throat\\'s too tender. \\n\\njerry: alright, sit down, sit down. (grabs a pill from the bottle, and starts advancing tward kramer - like an owner with his dog) \\n\\nkramer: i don\\'t want to! \\n\\njerry: c\\'mon. just sit down! \\n\\nkramer: (squirming) jerry! what?! \\n\\njerry: sit down! sit down! \\n\\nkramer: (struggling) hey! \\n\\njerry: lean your head back. open your mouth! (grabs kramer\\'s head) open your mouth! open it! open it! \\n\\njerry: (reads the pill bottle) what kind of pills are these, anyways?! \"for smuckers\"? \"may cause panting and loss of fur\"? (turns to kramer) these are dog pills! \\n\\nkramer: whe have the same symptoms. \\n\\njerry: but, he\\'s a dog! you need to see a real doctor. \\n\\nkramer: no, no. no doctors. \\n\\njerry: alright.. (heads for the door, grabbing his coat) \\n\\nkramer: where are you going? \\n\\njerry: i\\'m taking the car. i gotta run some errands. you want to go? \\n\\nkramer: i don\\'t know.. \\n\\njerry: (opens the door) c\\'mon, you wanna go for a ride? (starts jiggling his keys - as if he\\'s calling out for a dog) huh? c\\'mon! c\\'mon! \\n\\n[setting: taxi cab] \\n\\ndriver: lady, could you move your head a little bit? \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\ndriver: your head. i can\\'t see out the back. (elaine slumps down in her seat) little more.. (elaine slumps lower) ..little more. (slides down until just her eyes and forehead can be seen) thank you. \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s car] \\n\\nkramer: i don\\'t see any tissues back her.. (looks out the windows) wait a minute!.. (jerry looks like he\\'s trying to keep something from kramer) this isn\\'t the way to the park! (starts getting even more energetic) where are we going?.. i recognize this block! (looks at jerry, scared) you\\'re taking me to the doctor! \\n\\n[setting: coffee shop] \\n\\ngeorge: so, uh, mom, dad, i was hoping that you could help me to remember my childhood a little clearly.. \\n\\nestelle: i feel a draft. (grabs the bread basket and her drink) let\\'s change tables. \\n\\nfrank: get outta here! we have a booth. \\n\\nestelle: frank, i\\'m cold! \\n\\nfrank: order a hot dish. \\n\\nestelle: why can\\'t we sit over there? (points to a table) \\n\\nfrank: (yelling) that\\'s not a booth! \\n\\nestelle: (trying to match frank\\'s loudness) so, who says we have to sit in a booth?! \\n\\nfrank: (loud shouting) i didn\\'t take the subway all the way to new york to sit at a table like that! (gestures to the table) \\n\\nestelle: (nagging yell) well, i didn\\'t take the subway to be in a drafty restaurant! \\n\\ngeorge: (pleading for them to stop) mom.. dad. \\n\\nfrank: now, george, what do you want to know about your childhood? \\n\\ngeorge: (fed up with his parents) actually, i think i\\'m pretty clear on it. \\n\\nfrank: (looks up) where\\'s that breeze coming from? \\n\\n[setting: nyc street] \\n\\njerry: kramer, outta the car. out, now! \\n\\nkramer: no, jerry! \\n\\njerry: alright, that\\'s it.. (grabs kramer, trying to pull him out of the car) \\n\\nkramer: no! don\\'t! \\n\\njerry: hey, hey! get back over here! kramer! get over here! you are bad! bad neighbor! kramer! \\n\\n[setting: tenant board room] \\n\\neldridge: just then, a rescue ship emerged from the fog and saved us. it was.. (stops, then gives george a look. george stops knocking on the walls) it was the sweetest sight my eyes ever saw. \\n\\nricardi: (touched) thank you mr. eldridge. the tenant board will now hear mr. costanza\\'s testimony. \\n\\n[setting: newman\\'s apartment] \\n\\njerry: newman, how\\'d it go? did you get it all delivered? (sees the pac) what happened? \\n\\nnewman: kramer bit me! \\n\\njerry: bit you?! \\n\\nnewman: we had an arguement about me going to hawaii, and he locked onto my ankle like it was a soup bone. i\\'m hubbled! i don\\'t think i can do my route - and they\\'re awarding the transfer in two days! \\n\\njerry: (bravely) well, what if i deliver it? \\n\\nnewman: you?! (laughs hysterically) you can\\'t deliver mail! \\n\\njerry: well, why not? \\n\\nnewman: (thinks for a moment) i guess you\\'re right. it\\'s just walking around putting it into boxes.. \\n\\njerry: what am i gonna wear? \\n\\nnewman: i could give you my uniform from my rookie year. \\n\\njerry: (excited) i can\\'t believe i\\'m gonna be a mailman! \\n\\njerry: (hands him some mail) there you go. merry chirstmas! \\n\\nowner: mail on sunday? \\n\\njerry: (shrugs) oops. (continues walking along the route, whistling. hands a newspaper to a homeless bum on the street, then keeps walking) \\n\\n[setting: tenant board room] \\n\\ngeorge: i was handcuffed to the bed.. in my underwear, (sighs) where i remained.. (scene cuts to another story) she was attractive.. she was, also, infact, a nazi.. (cuts to another story) the water.. that i had been swiming in was.. very cold. and, when i dropped the towel, there was.. significant shrinkage.. (scene cuts to, yet, another story) her parents were looking at me.. so, there i was, with a marble rye hanging from the end of a fishing pole.. (scene cuts to his closing statements) in closing, these stories have not been embellished, because - they need no embellishment. they are simply, horrifyingly, the story of my life as a short, stocky, slow witted bald man. (gets up) thank you. (every memeber of the board shows some sign that george\\'s story is most deserving of the apartment. ricardi is crying. george turns to leave, then remembers one more thing..) oh, also.. my fiance died from licking toxic envelopes that i picked out. (sobs and loud crying erupts from the board members) thanks again. (leaves. eldridge looks defeated) \\n\\n[setting: newman\\'s apartment] \\n\\njerry: hey, i\\'ve been trying to jam stuff in the box, like you told me, but sometimes it says, like, \"photographs - do not bend\". \\n\\nnewman: \"do not bend\". (laughs evilly) just crease, crumple, cram.. you\\'ll do fine. (phone rings. newman answers it) hello?.. this is he. i don\\'t understand.. very well. (hangs up in disappointment) \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nnewman: that was the vice president of the post office. i didn\\'t get the transfer.. they knew it wasn\\'t me doing my route! \\n\\njerry: how did they know?! \\n\\nnewman: (stands up) too many people go their mail! close to 80%. no body from the post office has ever cracked the 50% barrier! it\\'s like the 3-minute mile! \\n\\njerry: (pleading) i tried my best! \\n\\nnewman: exactly. you\\'re a disgrace to the uniform. (newman takes off jerry\\'s mailman hat. jerry turns his head in shame. newman then tears the post office badge from jerry\\'s coat) \\n\\njerry: you know, this is your coat. \\n\\nnewman: (realizing) damn! \\n\\n[setting: central park] \\n\\nman 2: he flew right into your head. like he couldn\\'t avoid it. \\n\\nelaine: (rubbing her head to relieve the pain) really? \\n\\nman 2: never seen that before. bird into a woman\\'s head.. \\n\\n[setting: coffee shop] \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s not contest. the guy had nothing! the ship went down, he got into a life boat, i mean, come on. \\n\\njerry: boy, he didn\\'t know what he was up against. (george laughs) so, when do you move into the apartment? \\n\\ngeorge: they\\'re making their decision today. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s the matter with you? \\n\\nelaine: nothing.. except that a bird ran into my giant freak-head. (sits down) \\n\\njerry: what giant freak-head? \\n\\nelaine: (annoyed, near tears) the one that sits atop my disproportunately puny body.. i\\'m a walking candy apple! \\n\\njerry: so, it\\'s actually gotten to you? you\\'re playing right into his hands! \\n\\nelaine: (realizing) what? yeah.. you\\'re right!.. all i have to do is call him up, and sit with him, and show him that it doesn\\'t bother me. you know, laugh it off.. or jam a fork into his forehead. \\n\\njerry: (casually, sarcastic) either way. \\n\\nelaine: (getting up to leave) alright. \\n\\n[setting: restaurant] \\n\\nalan: i want to apologize for.. \\n\\nelaine: (shrugging it off) oh, please. \\n\\nalan: so you have a big head. \\n\\nelaine: (casually playing along) so what? \\n\\nalan: it goes well with that bump in your nose. \\n\\nelaine: (suddenly angry) what?! \\n\\nwoman: please! get help! there\\'s a crazy big-headed woman beating up some guy! tell the police \"the old mill restaurant\". hurry! \\n\\ncop: boy, that\\'s some cough you got there. \\n\\ncop 2: no, i think he\\'s trying to tell us something. what is it? (between coughs, kramer manages to say the word \"trouble\") trouble?! trouble? where? where\\'s trouble? (kramer coughs out the words \"old mill\") trouble at the old mill?! oh my god! good boy, good boy! lead the way! come on. \\n\\n[setting: george\\'s apartment building] \\n\\ngeorge: excuse me, uh, what are you doing in there? \\n\\nalan: i\\'m moving in. alan mercer. new neighbor. (they shake hands) \\n\\ngeorge: what? elaine\\'s big-head guy? they have you the apartment?! \\n\\nalan: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: why?! because you were stabbed, and.. got coffee thrown in your face, and.. uh.. (points to alan\\'s bandaged forehead) \\n\\nalan: oh, fork in the forehead. \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s why they gave you the apartment? \\n\\nalan: no, i just gave the super 50 bucks. \\n\\ngeorge: wait a minute, that is my apartment. i earned it with 34 years of misery! \\n\\nalan: tough luck, chinless. (goes into his new apartment, and slams the door on george) \\n\\njerry: so what happened to you yesterday? we were supposed to go to the auto show, i waited for you, you never came. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m sorry, i got really busy. how long did you wait? \\n\\njerry: five minutes. \\n\\nelaine: five minutes? that\\'s it? \\n\\njerry: what\\'s the difference? you never showed up. \\n\\nelaine: i could\\'ve! i mean, last week we waited for that friend of kramer\\'s for like, forty minutes. \\n\\njerry: well, we barely knew the guy. \\n\\nelaine: so, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for \\'em. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s the way it works. \\n\\nelaine: when did you tell george to be here? \\n\\njerry: i told him to meet us here in ten minutes. how long has it been? \\n\\nelaine: about five. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s enough. (they leave. george comes around the corner.) \\n\\ngeorge (looks at his watch): early! alright! (shivers.) cold. \\n\\nkramer: so, i noticed you bounced a check at the bodega. \\n\\njerry: how did you know about that? \\n\\nkramer: because marcelino, he taped it up on his cash register with all the other bad checks. \\n\\njerry: he can\\'t do that. \\n\\nkramer (sternly): it\\'s the only way you\\'ll learn. (tastes his eggs.) aw, these eggs are disgusting. this chicken should be ashamed of himself. \\n\\ngeorge: fantastic day! fantastic! \\n\\njerry: what happened? \\n\\ngeorge: (laughs - hehe) well, first, i\\'m brushing my teeth and this piece of apple-skin, that must have been lodged in there for days, comes loose. \\n\\njerry: fantastic. \\n\\ngeorge: then, i\\'m at the foundation... \\n\\njerry: you\\'re still doing that? \\n\\ngeorge: sometimes, once in a while. \\n\\njerry: when you feel guilty. \\n\\ngeorge: no, occasionally i\\'ll forget to let the machine pick up. anyway, they made this large donation, to a women\\'s prison, and i get to go down there and check it out. \\n\\nkramer: that\\'s caged heat. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah-hah! \\n\\njerry: what are you gonna do there? \\n\\ngeorge: nothing really, you know...just eh, stroll around the cell blocks, maybe eh, take in a shower fight. (chuckles.) hey eh, you know you got a bounced check hanging up in the little market over on columbus? \\n\\njerry: yes, i know, i know. \\n\\ngeorge: i noticed you eh, chose the eh \"clowns with balloons\" check design. \\n\\njerry: it was a mistake, the bank sent me the wrong ones. \\n\\nelaine: hey! look who\\'s here! hey kurt, this is jerry, and george, and kramer. \\n\\nkramer: hey, kurt. taste these eggs. \\n\\nkurt: uh, no - i only eat cage-free, farm-fresh. \\n\\nkramer: yes! these are sweatshop eggs. \\n\\nkurt (to elaine): ah, i gotta call the office. honey, will you order for me? \\n\\nelaine (sitting down): i\\'m a \"honey.\" he\\'s pretty great, huh? \\n\\njerry: is he from the future? \\n\\nelaine: no, he just shaves his head. i think it\\'s pretty gutsy. \\n\\ngeorge: listen, sweetheart, let me tell you a little something about guts. (points to his head.) this is guts. \\n\\nelaine: what? clinging to some scraps? \\n\\ngeorge: these are not \"scraps.\" these are historic remains of a once great society of hair. \\n\\nelaine: oh, did you guys stop at the bodega today? some moron bounced a clown check! \\n\\n[the bodega, starts with a shot of marcelino\\'s cash register with jerry\\'s clown check attached under a sign that reads \"checks no longer accepted from: \".] \\n\\ncheck #1246, dated dec. 15 \\x9196, made out to: columbus deli for $40.00 \\n\\njerry: again, i\\'m really sorry about the check, marcelino. \\n\\nmarcelino: people seem to like the clowns. \\n\\njerry (takes out his wallet): look, let me just give you the forty, plus another twenty for your trouble. \\n\\nmarcelino: \\'kay. \\n\\njerry (turning to leave): aren\\'t you going to take the check down? \\n\\nmarcelino: sorry, no. it\\'s store policy. \\n\\njerry: but it\\'s your bodega. \\n\\nmarcelino: even i am not above the policy. \\n\\nbetsy: those are our tennis courts. \\n\\ngeorge: tennis courts? w-w-what about the yard? where do they have the gang fights? \\n\\nbetsy: there\\'s no fights here, mr. costanza. this is a minimum security facility. \\n\\ngeorge: hmm. what about a hole? you ever put anybody in \"the box\"? \\n\\nbetsy: no. \\n\\ngeorge (to himself): this prison stinks. \\n\\nbetsy: and finally, the library, which has just been refurbished thanks to your generous donation. this is celia morgan, our librarian. \\n\\ncelia: nice to meet you. \\n\\nbetsy: i\\'ll be in my office if you need me. \\n\\ngeorge: thanks, warden. \\n\\nbetsy (sweetly): betsy. \\n\\ngeorge (disappointed): betsy. \\n\\ncelia: so, are you the head of the foundation? \\n\\ngeorge: well, let\\'s just say it wouldn\\'t exist without me. (notices another person in the library dressed the same as celia.) so you two uh, shop at the same store, (hu)? \\n\\ncelia: no, it\\'s standard issue. \\n\\ngeorge: oh my god...you\\'re in jail? (celia nods.) that is so cool! \\n\\njerry: you asked her out? \\n\\ngeorge: well...not \"out.\" she\\'s a prisoner. \\n\\njerry: how could you ask her out? \\n\\ngeorge: why not? \\n\\njerry: i remember when you wouldn\\'t date that girl who lived in queens because you didn\\'t want to go over the bridge! \\n\\ngeorge: that was different! \\n\\njerry: i\\'ll say. \\n\\ngeorge: jerry, i like being with her. plus, i know where she is all the time. i have relatively no competition. an-and you know how you live in fear of the pop-in? \\n\\njerry (shudders): the pop-in. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, no pop-in, no \"in the neighborhood,\" no \"i saw your light was on.\" and the best part is, if things go really well... \\n\\njerry: conjugal visit? \\n\\ngeorge (giddy): don\\'t jinx it! don\\'t jinx (trails off quietly in elation) \\n\\nkramer: hey. \\n\\ngeorge: hey. \\n\\nkramer: what\\'s up? \\n\\njerry: george is dating a convict. \\n\\nkramer: oh? what\\'s she in for? (putting groceries in the fridge) \\n\\ngeorge: embezzlement. \\n\\nkramer (approvingly): sounds like a nice girl. hey jerry, is it all right if i put some stuff in your fridge? \\'cause mine\\'s full. \\n\\njerry: yeah, sure. you don\\'t even have a fridge, do you? \\n\\nkramer: well, not here. \\n\\nkramer: okay (lifting the bag and carrying it into the apt.) \\n\\njerry: kramer, kramer, wait a minute, what the hell is that? \\n\\nkramer: well, it\\'s chicken feed. (slams the bag into jerry\\'s fridge.) \\n\\njerry: i sense something is afoot. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, i bought a chicken. \\n\\ngeorge: allow me. why? \\n\\nkramer: cage-free, farm-fresh eggs. \\n\\njerry: allow me. what are you, an idiot? \\n\\nkramer: no (throws hand in the air and turns and looks back at jerry) \\n\\nkurt: hold it, hold it, hold it, here, i got it. catch. (tosses his wallet to elaine, she pays the delivery guy.) \\n\\nelaine: hm. (looking at kurt\\'s driver\\'s license photo) hey, driver\\'s license. oh...my god. \\n\\nkurt: what? \\n\\nelaine: your hair. it\\'s so thick and lustrous. i mean, it...it was. \\n\\nkurt: well, it still is. i shave my head for my swim team. i just liked the way it looked, so i kept it. \\n\\nelaine: are you saying that i could be dating this hair? i mean wi..with you under it? (kurt shrugs.) \\n\\njerry: (sits up in bed) oh what... \\n\\nkramer: hey. \\n\\njerry: is that your \"chicken\" making all that noise? \\n\\nkramer: oh, jerry loves the morning. \\n\\njerry: who? \\n\\nkramer: little jerry seinfeld. i named my chicken after you. \\n\\njerry: thanks, that\\'s very sweet, but that is not, a chicken. \\n\\nkramer: of course it is. i picked it out myself. \\n\\njerry: well, you picked out a rooster. \\n\\nkramer: well, that would explain little jerry\\'s poor egg production. \\n\\ncelia: this was fun. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. i had a great time. \\n\\nguard: five minutes, mr. costanza. \\n\\ngeorge: the whole hour just flew by. (laughs - hehe) (begins cleaning up the table.) \\n\\nguard: i\\'ll get that. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, thanks, bobby. (to celia) well, i guess i\\'ll see you in four days. \\n\\ncelia: yeah. go out and have a ball with the guys. i\\'ll be waiting right here for you. \\n\\ngeorge: of course you will. (quick chuckle). you\\'re the best. (with a light fist motion across her chin) \\n\\ncelia: hmm \\n\\njerry: hello? \\n\\nhelen (in florida with morty): jerry? leo told us he saw your bounced check. are you having money problems? \\n\\njerry: i\\'m not having money problems. \\n\\nhelen: enough with the comedy! you\\'re very clever, you should look into advertising. \\n\\nmorty: he never even called ed roydlick. they were looking for someone! \\n\\njerry: i\\'m not calling ed roydlick. i\\'m doing fine! \\n\\nhelen: that\\'s it. i\\'m gonna to send you fifty dollars. \\n\\njerry: you are not sending me fifty dollars! \\n\\nhelen: we\\'re sending you fifty dollars! morty, get me an envelope. \\n\\njerry (angrily): i swear to god, if you send me fifty dollars, you are gonna be so sorry! \\n\\nmorty: i don\\'t see envelopes! \\n\\nhelen: they\\'re right in front of you! oh, for heaven\\'s sakes... (she puts the phone down on the couch and goes to help morty.) show you... \\n\\njerry: ma! ma! maaa! (hangs up the phone in disgust.) oh, ahhhh (sighs quietly) \\n\\ngeorge: how\\'re the folks? \\n\\njerry: good. \\n\\ngeorge: so? movie tonight? \\n\\njerry: i thought you were going out with celia? \\n\\ngeorge: i did. i\\'m back. i love this relationship, i feel so liberated! \\n\\njerry: having her in jail. \\n\\ngeorge: the only thing that bothers me is that i\\'m just coming up with this now. \\n\\njerry: yeah, dating a convicted felon. i don\\'t know how you missed it. \\n\\nelaine: here. (shows kurt\\'s driver\\'s license to jerry.) take a look at that. \\n\\njerry: huh. kurt\\'s an organ donor. \\n\\nelaine: no! he\\'s not bald. look! he\\'s got a full head of hair. \\n\\njerry: so he just shaves his head for no reason? \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s like using a wheelchair for the fun of it! \\n\\nelaine: and he\\'s growing it in just for me. (happily) it\\'s mine. it\\'s all mine. (clutches the photo between her hands and to her chest then looks at it again) \\n\\njerry: it\\'s just hair. \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s not just hair! look! \\n\\njerry: it\\'s brown. \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s chestnut with auburn highlights! \\n\\njerry: so? \\n\\nelaine: you\\'re not around women. you don\\'t know how important a man\\'s hair is. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m sorry, george, but it\\'s true. \\n\\ngeorge (close to tears): i knew it. \\n\\nmarcelino: hey, kramer. \\n\\nkramer: yeah (quietly) \\n\\nmarcelino: nice rooster. \\n\\nkramer: yeah (again quietly) \\n\\nmarcelino: what\\'s his name? \\n\\nkramer: ah, well, this is little jerry seinfeld. \\n\\nmarcelino: little jerry seinfeld. does he bounce checks? (laughs) \\n\\nkramer: look, can\\'t you take jerry\\'s check down? \\n\\nmarcelino: sorry kramer, can\\'t help you. \\n\\nkramer: hey, hey jerry, come on. sorry. \\n\\nmarcelino (impressed): i like the way he handles himself. \\n\\nkramer: oh yeah (quietly) \\n\\nelaine: ohhh, it\\'s coming in already! \\n\\nkurt: yeah (quietly) \\n\\nelaine: wow, you have some very nice little seedlings here. huh... \\n\\nkurt: what? \\n\\nelaine: well, it doesn\\'t seem to be coming in so good over here. or here. \\n\\nkurt: what do you mean? (goes into the bedroom to look in the mirror.) \\n\\nelaine: well, i don\\'t know... h- how long have you been shaving your head for? \\n\\nkurt (from the bedroom): about three years. \\n\\nelaine: huh. \\n\\nkurt: oh my god! (steps into the doorway) i\\'m going bald! \\n\\ncelia: george! i\\'m so glad to see you! \\n\\ngeorge: hey, i brought you some cigarettes. you buy yourself something nice. \\n\\ncelia: good news - i\\'m up for parole. \\n\\ngeorge: parole! (feigning joy) that\\'s dynamite! \\n\\njerry: so marcelino\\'s going to take down the check? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, well, it comes down if little jerry seinfeld wins the cockfight. \\n\\njerry: great! (realizing) what? \\n\\nkramer: well, marcelino, he has cockfights in the back of his store. \\n\\njerry: ah ha... \\n\\nkramer: yeah, so he says if little jerry seinfeld wins, the check comes down. \\n\\njerry: kramer, cockfighting is illegal. \\n\\nkramer: only in the united states. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s inhumane! \\n\\nkramer: no, jerry, it\\'s not what you think it is. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s two roosters peckin\\' at each other! \\n\\nkramer: what? \\n\\njerry: yeah! \\n\\nkramer: well, i thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like \"american gladiators.\" \\n\\njerry: no kramer, little jerry could get hurt. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, well, i left him with marcelino! \\n\\nkramer: my little jerry! (runs out.) \\n\\njerry: hey, did you get little jerry, is he o.k.? \\n\\nkramer: oh well, he\\'s more than o.k., he won! \\n\\njerry: you let him fight? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, well i couldn\\'t get there in time to stop it, but you should have seen little jerry, jerry! flappin\\' his wings and struttin\\' his stuff! he was peckin\\' and weavin\\' and bobbin\\' and talkin\\' trash! he didn\\'t even have to touch him! the other rooster ran out of the ring. the whole fight lasted two seconds. \\n\\njerry: how long do they usually last? \\n\\nkramer: five seconds. and marcelino says he\\'s taking your check down today. \\n\\njerry: great! \\n\\nkramer: hey. \\n\\ngeorge: celia\\'s up for parole. \\n\\nkramer: hey, little jerry won his cockfight. \\n\\ngeorge: what? \\n\\nkramer: who? \\n\\njerry: i\\'m too tired. \\n\\nkramer (to jerry): o.k., listen, i want you to come by later, alright? \\'cause we\\'re having a victory party for little jerry. \\n\\njerry: o.k. (kramer leaves.) \\n\\ngeorge (sadly): it\\'s over, jerry. she\\'s gettin\\' out. \\n\\njerry: ah, i\\'m so sorry. \\n\\ngeorge: she\\'s been locked up for two years. she\\'s gonna want to make up for lost time. dinners. movies. (rubs his forehead.) talking... \\n\\njerry: in other words, a normal relationship. \\n\\ngeorge: heh, haa. and that\\'s no good. i\\'ve tried it straight, jerry. we\\'ve all seen the results. for me, sick is the only way to go. \\n\\njerry: well, she\\'ll still be an ex-con. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s not the same. \\n\\njerry: hey, if you two are meant to be together...i\\'m sure the cops\\'ll pick her up on something. \\n\\nelaine: kurt? what\\'s with the sweats? aren\\'t we going out? \\n\\nkurt: i don\\'t care. \\n\\nelaine: you, uh...got a big stain on your shirt. \\n\\nkurt: oh yeah...meatball...fell out of my sandwich. \\n\\nelaine: you already ate? \\n\\nkurt: it\\'s from yesterday. \\n\\nmarcelino: jerry! you missed a hell of a cockfight last night. \\n\\njerry: then what is my check still doing up? we had a deal! \\n\\nmarcelino: now we have a new deal. \\n\\njerry: new deal? \\n\\nmarcelino: when little jerry seinfeld is mine, the check will be yours. \\n\\njerry: this is outrageous! (to marcelino) pack of juicy fruit. \\n\\nmarcelino (tosses the gum on the counter): 85 cents. \\n\\njerry: 85 cents? that is outrageous! \\n\\njerry: kramer, marcelino wants us to sell him little jerry seinfeld. \\n\\nkramer: well, that\\'s out of the question. \\n\\njerry: but kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, if you got a loser. but little jerry was born to cockfight! \\n\\njerry: no, no more cockfighting. let\\'s just sell him to marcelino the cockfighter and be done with it! \\n\\nkramer: you know, i think you\\'re jealous. \\n\\njerry: of what? \\n\\nkramer (points at jerry like he\\'s found him out): yah, yah! you see in little jerry seinfeld the unlimited future you once had. now, just because jerry seinfeld is a has-been, don\\'t make little jerry seinfeld a never-was! \\n\\njerry: kramer, give me that rooster! \\n\\nkramer: never! you hate him because he\\'s doing more with your name than you ever will! yah-yah! (kramer leaves.) \\n\\nbetsy: george, celia has listed you as a character reference. whatever you can tell us would certainly be helpful in, her getting paroled. \\n\\ngeorge: well, anything i can do to help, um...she\\'s a wonderful girl. very smart. very eh...crafty. \\n\\nbetsy: does she have any plans after she\\'s released? \\n\\ngeorge: plans. schemes. she ah, she keeps talking about getting back together with her old friends, you know - \"the gang,\" as she likes to call them (chuckles), you know. yeah, they\\'re eh, they\\'re hatching something, you can count on that. \\n\\nmarcelino: jerry! tomorrow night\\'s fight-night. where\\'s my rooster? \\n\\njerry: kramer won\\'t sell. \\n\\nmarcelino: well, tell you what i\\'m gonna do. i\\'m gonna take down your check anyway. \\n\\njerry: oh well, thank you, marcelino. \\n\\nmarcelino: well, perhaps someday you will do me a favor. and that day is today. little jerry seinfeld must go down in the third round of tomorrow\\'s main event. \\n\\njerry: you want little jerry to take a dive? \\n\\nmarcelino: shhh, not so loud. \\n\\njerry: first of all, i don\\'t think you can make a rooster take a dive. \\n\\nmarcelino: can, too! \\n\\njerry: second of all, jerry seinfeld - big or little - doesn\\'t go down for anyone, anywhere, at anytime! now i\\'d appreciate it if you please leave. \\n\\nmarcelino (leaving): big jerry is making a big mistake, jerry. \\n\\njerry: we\\'ll see about that. (runs to the window and shouts up to kramer, who\\'s on the roof.) kramer, i\\'m comin\\' up! we got a cockfight to win! \\n\\nkramer: o.k.! \\n\\nkurt: elaine said you would be the best person i could talk to. \\n\\ngeorge (examining kurt\\'s head with a lamp): yep. classic horseshoe pattern. i\\'ve seen a lot of this. \\n\\nkurt: oh, god. \\n\\ngeorge: no, no, kurt - wrong attitude. you should be happy now. \\n\\nkurt: happy? why should i be happy? \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'ve still got pretty good coverage. once the enemy advances beyond this perimeter - (points at kurt\\'s head with a pen) - then you won\\'t be kurt anymore. \\n\\nkurt: who will i be? \\n\\nkurt: how long do i have? \\n\\ngeorge (solemnly): 14 months. maybe 10. \\n\\nkurt: is there anything i can do? \\n\\ngeorge: yes. live, dammit. live! every precious moment as if this was the last year of your life. because in many ways...it is. (there\\'s a knock at the door.) excuse me. \\n\\ngeorge: celia? w-w-what are you doing here? \\n\\ncelia: well, i didn\\'t get my parole, so i busted out. \\n\\ngeorge (nervously): and-and you just decided to pop in...! \\n\\nelaine: kurt! \\n\\nkurt: elaine...(holds out a wedding ring) will you marry me? \\n\\nkramer: oh, yeah. oh, yeah. boy he\\'s lookin\\' good, huh jerry? \\n\\njerry: yeah. alright, i think that\\'s enough for today. (kramer picks up little jerry and takes him to the sink.) little jerry is lean, mean, peckin\\' machine! (kramer starts filling a pot with water.) what are you doing with that? \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m just gonna heat this up. make a little hot-tub for little jerry. \\n\\njerry: hey, kramer...? \\n\\njerry: be careful. \\n\\ngeorge: hey. \\n\\njerry: hey, guess what! little jerry ran from here to newman\\'s in under thirty seconds! \\n\\ngeorge: is that good? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know. where have you been? \\n\\ngeorge: celia broke out of prison. i\\'m sitting in my home, she shows up at the door! \\n\\njerry: oh my god! the break-out/pop-in! \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. hey jerry, listen to this. i discovered something even better than conjugal visit sex. fugitive sex! now, it\\'s like everytime - \\n\\njerry (interrupts): george, this is a little too much for me - escaped convicts, fugitive sex...i got a cockfight to focus on. (jerry leaves.) \\n\\nelaine: hey hey kurt, slow down! i can\\'t just marry you, whim-bam-boom! i mean, i need some \"fiance-time,\" i need some \"make-my-girlfriends-jealous\" time... \\n\\nkurt: plus, you want to get to know me. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, yeah, that too. \\n\\nkurt: well, how much time? \\n\\nelaine: (sighs wa-ah) i don\\'t know...a year? \\n\\nkurt: no, no, no...it has to be now. \\n\\nelaine: (sighs ahh) could i see the ring again? \\n\\njerry (to elaine): so, you\\'re actually considering it? \\n\\nelaine: well, it\\'ll be a couple of years before he\\'s completely bald. those\\'ll be good times. \\n\\njerry: marriage is a big step, elaine. your life\\'ll totally change. \\n\\nelaine: jerry, it\\'s three-thirty in the morning. i\\'m at a cockfight. what am i clinging to? \\n\\ngeorge: oh, hey, sorry i\\'m late. \\n\\njerry: hey. \\n\\ngeorge: sorry i\\'m late. \\n\\njerry: where\\'s celia? \\n\\ngeorge: she didn\\'t want to come, she-she\\'s not really into sports. \\n\\njerry: hmm. (nodding head) \\n\\njerry: hey, how\\'s he doin\\'? \\n\\nkramer: ohh, he\\'s got a big sweat going. (takes an envelope out of his pocket.) oh, this came for you express-mail. it\\'s from your parents. \\n\\njerry (opens the envelope): fifty dollars. i don\\'t believe this! \\n\\nkramer: there\\'s marcelino.

(imitates the \\'stink-eye\\') so i give hime the crook-eye back, (imitates the \\'crook-eye\\') you know.. then, i notice that he\\'s not alone! i\\'m taking on the entire van buren boys! \\n\\njerry: the van buren boys? there\\'s a street gang named after president martin van buren? \\n\\nkramer: oh yeah, and they\\'re just as mean as he was! so, i make a move to the door, you know, (makes a noise) they block it! so, i lunged for the bathroom. (demonstrates) i grab the knob - occupado! then they back me up agains the cartoon map of italy, and all of the sudden, they just stop. \\n\\nelaine: what? what happened? \\n\\nkramer: because i\\'m still holding the garlic shaker.. yeah.. like this (grabs jerry\\'s peper shaker, and demonstrates) i\\'m only showing eight fingers. \\n\\njerry: well, what does that mean? \\n\\nkramer: that\\'s their secret sign! see, van buren, he was teh eighth president..

(jerry thinks about this, then shakes it off) \\n\\njerry: there is no way ellen is the loser of that group. \\n\\ngeorge: are you looking deep down at the real person underneath? \\n\\njerry: no, i\\'m being as superficial as i possibly can! \\n\\ngeorge: (changing subject) hey, i htink i may have found someone for the scholarship. \\n\\njerry: yeah? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m interviewing all these annoying little overachievers.. finally, this kid walks in - steven koren - a regular guy.. likes sports.. watches t.v.. \\n\\njerry: is he smart? \\n\\ngeorge: (defensively) he knows how to read. and he also knows finishing an entire book doesn\\'t prove anything. and get this he\\'s into architecture. \\n\\njerry: hey! just like you pretend to be. \\n\\ngeorge: yes. with a little guidance, steven koren is going to be everything i claim to be, only for real. that\\'s my dream, jerry. \\n\\njerry: i had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me! \\n\\n[setting: j. peterman\\'s apartment] \\n\\nelaine: mister peterman, thanks for having me over. your place isn\\'t quite what i imagined.. (it\\'s plain, with no sign of peterman\\'s personality) \\n\\npeterman: ohhh.. it\\'s just a place to flop. (sits in his recliner) \\n\\nelaine: well, (clears throat) what part of your life (hits the record button on a mini-recorder, and sets it down on the table) do you want to start with? foreign intrigue? exotic romances? \\n\\npeterman: oh, elaine, we\\'ve covered all of that in the catalogue ad nauseum. no, i would like this book to be about my day-to-day life. \\n\\nelaine: oh. \\n\\npeterman: (turns on the t.v, and starts flipping through the channels) oh damn. they changed the cable stations again.. just when i finally memorized them. \\n\\nelaine: well, mister peterman, do you want to, um.. \\n\\npeterman: (still flipping through the channels) 2.. cbs.. \\n\\nelaine: get, um, started.. \\n\\npeterman: 3.. i don\\'t know what that is.. where\\'s my damn preview channel? \\n\\nelaine: (after observing peterman\\'s home life) well, i - i got ta tell you, mister peterman.. i don\\'t think i see a whole book here. \\n\\npeterman: well, i\\'m sure we\\'ll come up with something. what do you say you and i order ourselves a pie? do you like lorenzo\\'s? \\n\\nelaine: you know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place by the van buren boys? \\n\\npeterman: (interested) you don\\'t say. \\n\\nelaine: yeah. the only think that saved him is that he accidentally flashed their secret gang sign. \\n\\npeterman: well, that\\'s pretty exciting. (pause) let\\'s put that in the book. \\n\\nelaine: but, that didn\\'t happen to you. \\n\\npeterman: so, we pay off your friend, and it becomes a peterman. \\n\\nelaine: no, i - i really don\\'t think you can do that. \\n\\npeterman: (looking at his dying plant) ohh, damn. i forgot to buy plant food again.. i\\'ll bet i got a coupon for it. (starts looking through a small coupon box) \\n\\nelaine: you know what? maybe i better talk to my friend. \\n\\n[setting: coffee shop] \\n\\njerry: is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday? \\n\\nellen: no, this is brand new. do you like it? \\n\\njerry: actually, yeah. (pause) wait a second! is that the fork that fell on the floor?! (dramatically) are you using the fork that fell on the floor?! \\n\\nellen: (laughs) no, jerry, the waitress game be another one. \\n\\njerry: i guess that\\'s all right. \\n\\nellen: is something wrong, jerry? \\n\\njerry: no, absolutely nothing. (they get up to leave) you\\'re fantastic! (they meet up with kramer and george on the way out) hey guys! \\n\\ngeorge: hey. \\n\\njerry: (gesturing to ellen) kramer, george, this is ellen. \\n\\n[setting: susan ross foundation conference room] \\n\\ngeorge: ladies and gentlemen, this (opens the door, steven is standing there) is steven koren. his g.p.a. is a solid 2.0! right in that meaty part of the curve - not showing off, not falling behind. \\n\\nwyck: george, the quailifications for this scholarship were suppose to be.. largely academic. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m sure we\\'re all aware of the flaws and biases of standardized tests.. \\n\\nwyck: these aren\\'t standardized tests - these are his grades. \\n\\ngeorge: besides, steven koren has the highest of aspirations. he wants to be (pauses for effect) an architect. \\n\\nwyck: is that right? \\n\\nsteven: actually, maybe i could set my sights a little bit higher. \\n\\ngeorge: (laughs) steven, nothing is higher than an architect. \\n\\nsteven: i think i\\'d really like to be a city planner. (sits down, addressing the entire foundation board) why limit myself to just one building, when i can design a whole city? \\n\\nwyck: well, that\\'s a good point. \\n\\ngeorge: (mutters) no, it\\'s not. \\n\\nsteven: well, isn\\'t an architect just an art school drop-out with a tilty desk, and a big ruler? (laughs - so do the board members) \\n\\ngeorge: (irritated) it\\'s called a t-square. \\n\\nwyck: you know, the stupidest guy in my fraternity became an architect - after he flunked out of dental school! (everyone but george laughs) contratulations, young man. (shakes steven\\'s hand) \\n\\nsteven: thank you. \\n\\nwyck: susan would be proud of what you\\'re doing. \\n\\nsteven: thank you. \\n\\n[setting: peterman\\'s office] \\n\\nkramer: and they made it their sign, because, van buren, our 8th president, was the man they most admired. \\n\\npeterman: (laughs) kramer, my friend, that is one ripping good yarn.. (hands kramer a check) \\n\\nkramer: you know, if you like that one, i got more.. what are you looking for? romance? comedy? adventue? .. erotica? (clicks his tongue) \\n\\nelaine: no, uh, kramer. i don\\'t think - \\n\\npeterman: (interrupting) how much would you take for the whole lot? \\n\\nkramer: my whole lot? \\n\\npeterman: name your price, man! \\n\\nkramer: (thinks) 1500 dollars. \\n\\npeterman: i\\'ll give you half that. \\n\\nkramer: (excited) done! \\n\\npeterman: kramer, my friend, (gestures to elaine) consider elaine at your disposal. \\n\\nkramer: okay.. (to elaine) well, i, uh.. i like to work in the evenings.. (elaine slumps back, and covers her head in misfortune) \\n\\n[setting: elaine\\'s office] \\n\\nelaine: would you please just get on with the stupid bob saccamano story?! \\n\\nkramer: well, i\\'m on the phone with bob, and i realize right then and there that i need to return this pair of pants. so, i\\'m off to the store. \\n\\nelaine: what happened to bob saccamano? \\n\\nkramer: well, nothing. his part of the story is done. (elaine covers her face with her hands - showing her difficulty coping with kramer) so i\\'m waiting for the subway, it\\'s not coming, so i decided to hoof it through the tunnel. \\n\\nelaine: alright, well, now that\\'s something.. \\n\\nkramer: well, i don\\'t know if i lost track of time - or what, but the next think i knew.. \\n\\nelaine: (adding) a train is bearing down on you?! \\n\\nkramer: no, i slipped - and fell in the mud. ruining the very pants i was about to return. \\n\\nelaine: (reflects on the story) i don\\'t understand.. you were wearing the pants you were returning? \\n\\nkramer: well, i guess i was.. \\n\\nelaine: (still confused) what were you gonna wear on the way back? \\n\\nkramer: elaine, are you listening?! i didn\\'t even get there! (pauses) all right, next story.. \\n\\nelaine: alright, i think i got enough for one day. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, yeah, chew on that. \\n\\nelaine: (mocking) yeah, i\\'ll chew on that. \\n\\nkramer: oh, hey, listen, by the way - i\\'m hosting a little get-together tonight in honor of my little financial upturn.. \\n\\nelaine: oh, thanks. i\\'ve got plans. \\n\\nkramer: elaine, you should be there to document it. \\n\\nelaine: (putting on her coat) oh, you\\'re getting together with some of your jackass friends, and you want me to take notes? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, but get there after nine. you know, give the poeple a chance to loosen up. \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\njerry: so you\\'re denying him the scholarship just because he wants to be a city planner? \\n\\ngeorge: i was betrayed! that kid was like a son to me. and if there\\'s one person you should be able to hold down, it\\'s your own flesh and blood. like my father.. my father\\'s father before him. \\n\\njerry: you know, maybe philanthropy is not your field. (phone rings, he answers it) hello. oh, hi, ellen. yeah, i called the hotel.. we\\'re all set for the weekend. \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'re spending the weekend with ellen? \\n\\njerry: (to george, in a \\'cha-ching!\\' motion) vermont! (to ellen) with any luck, they said we could stay an extra couple of days if we want to! (george is disturbed. he gets up, goes go kramer\\'s door, and knocks. they talk) four days at a beautiful bed-and-breakfast! i can\\'t wait.. buy-bye. (hangs up. george and kramer come into jerry\\'s apartment, confronting him) what? (george takes the phone off the hook) what is this? \\n\\ngeorge: (to kramer) you want to start? \\n\\nkramer: (to george) uh, no, no, no.. you go ahead. i gotta get my thoughts together. \\n\\ngeorge: jerry, this whole ellen situation.. has gone far enough. \\n\\njerry: what?! \\n\\nkramer: (adding) jerry, she\\'s a loser. (george points to kramer - gesturing that he\\'s right on target) \\n\\njerry: where is this coming from? she\\'s great! \\n\\ngeorge: (concerned) why\\'re you doing this, jerry? is it your career? things will pick up. \\n\\njerry: there\\'s nothing wrong with my career! \\n\\nkramer: (like a parent) well, i still like the bloomingdale\\'s executive training program for him. \\n\\ngeorge: i though we said we weren\\'t going to discuss that now! \\n\\nkramer: well, you know, i think it\\'s something he should consider. \\n\\ngeorge: of course he should consider it, but now is not the time! \\n\\nkramer: listen, george, all these issues are interrelated. \\n\\njerry: (fed up) alright! excuse me! (gets up) i\\'m not buying any of this! \\n\\nkramer: all right, so what\\'re you saying? that we\\'re wrong? oh, everybody\\'s wrong but you! \\n\\njerry: you know, this is liek that twilight zone where the guy wakes up, and he\\'s the same - but everyone else is different! \\n\\nkramer: which one? \\n\\njerry: they were all like that! \\n\\n[setting: nyc street] \\n\\nsteven: why\\'d you take away my scholarship, mister costanza? \\n\\ngeorge: well, steven, i, uh.. (all the sudden, a small gang steps out of nowhere, surrounding george) \\n\\nsteven: these are my new friends - the van buren boys. \\n\\nmember 1: he became so disillusioned, he had to join us. \\n\\ngeorge: oh.. nice. \\n\\nsteven: i want my scholarship back, so i can be a city planner. \\n\\ngeorge: what about architect, steven? \\n\\nmember 1: (moves threateningly close to george) city planner. \\n\\n[setting: cafe] \\n\\nfriend 1: great party, k-man! \\n\\nkramer: yeah, well, you got that straight! (turns to elaine) hey, elaine, try the beef - because that\\'s realy au jus sauce, huh. (dramatically) real au jus sauce! \\n\\nelaine: (sourly) i\\'ll make a note of it. \\n\\nfriend 1: hey, kramer, \\n\\nkramer: yeah? \\n\\nfriend 1: ramirez has never heard your pants story. \\n\\nkramer: ohh kay! well, you know, i had bob saccamano on the phone, and i suddenly realized that i- (elaine stops him) \\n\\nelaine: you can\\'t tell that story now. it belongs to peterman. \\n\\nkramer: what do ya mean? \\n\\nelaine: you signed the release. \\n\\nkramer: yeah. \\n\\nelaine: he sat in mud. not you. \\n\\nkramer: but i did sit in mud. \\n\\nelaine: (stern) ya didn\\'t! you never sat in mud! \\n\\nkramer: (pleading) i was all dirty! \\n\\nelaine: it ever happened! understand? \\n\\nkramer: (to crowd) hey, hey, hey! all right! yeah, uh, yeah.. well.. uh, the pants. they, uh, they fit, uh, well - and so i, uh, decided i wasn\\'t gonna return them! (laughs) wooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! \\n\\nfriend 1: it\\'s getting late. maybe we better get going. (they all get up to leave) \\n\\nkramer: what? you\\'re gonna go now? hey, woah! i don\\'t.. (watches his friends leave) \\n\\nkramer: (frantic) kramer, kramer! i got big trouble with the - with the van buren boys. \\n\\nkramer: hey, now, they\\'re tough cookies. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, and i - i heard you got on their good side. now, what\\'d you do? \\n\\nkramer: uh.. ah, (looks over at elaine, and realizes he can\\'t tell the van buren boys story) oh, nothing - nothing.. no, i certainly don\\'t have any stories, if that\\'s what you\\'re implying. (laughs heartily) \\n\\ngeorge: (frantic) kramer, do you know what those guys are gonna do to me?! \\n\\nkramer: yeah, well, uh.. you know uh, you didn\\'t hear from me, but, uh, the van buren boys - they never hassle their own kind. \\n\\ngeorge: you mean, like, a former member? \\n\\n[setting: jerry\\'s apartment] \\n\\nelaine: these kramer stories are unusable! (thumbs through them) i mean, some of them aren\\'t even stories! (holds one out) look, this is a list of things in his apartment! \\n\\njerry: is my toaster oven on there? \\n\\nelaine: how am i ever gonna turn this into a book? \\n\\njerry: well, just shape them - change them. you\\'re a writer. \\n\\nelaine: yes! i\\'m a writer. \\n\\njerry: make them interesting. \\n\\nelaine: interesting! of course! people love interesting writing! \\n\\njerry: well, i gotta go to the airport. i\\'m picking up my parents. \\n\\nelaine: what? wheren\\'t they just here? \\n\\njerry: yeah. i\\'m flying them in to meet ellen. i don\\'t know where to turn! i gotta see what they think of her. \\n\\nelaine: maybe we could all have dinner later? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t think so. i\\'m gonna try to get them to fly right back tonight. \\n\\nkramer: oh, hey! hey, have i told you about my bunions? oh, you\\'re gonna love this story! (rubs his hands together) so, i line up my cold cuts on the couch next to me, but as i\\'m stacking them up, they keep falling into my foot bath! (jerry and elaine look disgusted) \\n\\njerry: kramer, this is awful! we don\\'t want to hear about this! \\n\\nkramer: damn! \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nkramer: oh, i bought a bunch of bunion stories from newman - but they all stink! \\n\\nelaine: how much did you pay for them? \\n\\nkramer: eight bucks! i think i got ripped off! (leaves, yelling out \"newman!\") \\n\\n[setting: peterman\\'s office] \\n\\nelaine: oh, what didn\\'t you like about the first chapter? \\n\\npeterman: well, it started out nicely \"i\\'m returning some pants.\" a very identifiable problem.. (turns page) \"i set of down a train tunnel.\".. (turns page) but that\\'s where the story takes a most unappealing turn. \\n\\nelaine: oh, no, no! that\\'s where it gets interesting! don\\'t you see? the - the train is bearing down on you, you - you dive into a side tunnel - and you run into a whole band of underground tunnel dwellers! \\n\\npeterman: it just seems so cliched, and obvious. it\\'s not interesting writing. \\n\\nelaine: yeah.. yeah. i know. um.. how about if, instead of.. diving from the train, you.. uh, you, i don\\'t know, you slip and, and fall in some mud, and.. ruin your pants? \\n\\npeterman: (intrigued) the very pants i was returning. that\\'s perfect irony! elaine, that is interesting writing! (the intercom beeps) \\n\\nsecretary: i have a cosmo kramer on line 4. \\n\\npeterman: (picks up the phone) peterman, here. \\n\\nkramer: mister peterson, you gotta sell me my stories back! \\n\\npeterman: you want to know something? i no longer need them! \\n\\nelaine: no, no. mister peterman, why don\\'t we keep them - as a, as a reference? \\n\\npeterman: nonsense! (to kramer) i have benes\\' woderfully imaginative mind to spin my stories. you take back your tales, you vagabond! \\n\\nkramer: yippie-yi-yay! \\n\\npeterman: (hangs up) there you are, elaine. go forth, and create. (elaine gets up to leave) and, by the way, when you get to that chapter about my romantic escapades - feel free to toss yourself in the mix. \\n\\n[setting: nyc street] \\n\\ngeorge: hey, van b. boys. \\n\\nsteven: so, mister costanza, did you get my scholarship back? \\n\\ngeorge: now, fellas, fellas.. easy. you wouldn\\'t want to beat up on one of your own. \\n\\nmember 2: is that right? then why don\\'t you flash us the sign? \\n\\ngeorge: right.. the sign. (hesitates, then makes a series of stupid gestures) \\n\\nsteven: that\\'s not the sign. \\n\\ngeorge: (defensively loud) it was when i was banging! \\n\\nmember 2: all right, if you really are one of us.. let\\'s see you take the wallet off the next guy who walks by. \\n\\ngeorge: love to! (cracks his knuckles, then winces under the pain) \\n\\n[setting: coffee shop] \\n\\nellen: and after college, i got my masters at the sorbonne. \\n\\nmorty: sorbonne? oh, hey.

(goes out onto the sidewalk. the seinfelds walk by) seinfelds! \\n\\nmorty: hey, george! \\n\\ngeorge: shhh! listen, you gotta do me a favor. give me your wallet. i\\'ll give it back to you later. \\n\\nmorty: how\\'re your folks? \\n\\ngeorge: eh, they\\'re trying to pick out a new couch - you don\\'t want to know.

(slams down phone) \\n\\nowner: (picks up phone) china panda. \\n\\nelaine: (using silly voice) uh, yeah yeah. i\\'d like to place an order. \\n\\nowner: ah, what you like? \\n\\nkramer: well, i\\'m a poppa. \\n\\njerry: bring it on. nothing\\'s throwing me at this point. \\n\\nkramer: (handing jerry a cigar) well, as of today i am a proud parent of a one-mile stretch of the arthur berkhardt expressway. \\n\\njerry: oh, that adopt-a-highway thing. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, i\\'m part of the solution now jerry. yeah, i went down there and i checked it out this morning. here, take a look. mile one-fourteen. \\n\\njerry: aw, looks just like you. \\n\\nkramer: aw, i\\'m beaming jerry. \\n\\njerry: so what d\\'you have to do? pay to keep it clean? \\n\\nkramer: they try to push you into using their cleaning crew, with all their so-called maintenance equipment. \\n\\njerry: that old scam. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, well that\\'s why i\\'m doing it all myself. this parenting isn\\'t about delegating responsibility, it\\'s about being there. \\n\\njerry: at the side of the road, with a pile of garbage. \\n\\nkramer: quality time. \\n\\ngeorge: keys. i can\\'t find my keys. \\n\\njerry: you lost phil rizzuto\\'s head?! \\n\\ngeorge: have you seen \\'em? \\n\\njerry: no. \\n\\ngeorge: dammit! \\n\\nkramer: c\\'mon, retrace your steps. what d\\'you do today? \\n\\ngeorge: i got up, i was supposed to go to work, i came here instead. \\n\\nkramer: right. \\n\\njerry: well, they\\'re not here. you\\'ll have to dig up your spare set. \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t have a spare set. all my keys say \\'do not duplicate\\'. \\n\\njerry: so? \\n\\ngeorge: so you can\\'t duplicate \\'em. \\n\\nkramer: sure you can. (to jerry) such a sweet kid. \\n\\nelaine: oh. oh, hi. china panda? \\n\\ndelivery boy: (suspicious) why you waiting on the street and not in your apartment? \\n\\nelaine: i... thought that i would meet you halfway. \\n\\ndelivery boy: you really live here? \\n\\nelaine: oh yeah. (handing over money) there you go, keep the change. bye now. i\\'ll see you. \\n\\nelaine: (at the boy\\'s back) this isn\\'t fair. this is address discrimination! \\n\\njerry: well, i cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf. \\n\\ngeorge: so the plan is to secretly sterilise her mouth? \\n\\njerry: by the time i\\'m through with her mouth, she\\'ll be able to eat off it. is it safe to drink bleach if you dilute it? \\n\\ngeorge: no, stings the throat. anyway, so i was coming along here, and i felt like a piece of cake, you know? but then i thought, it\\'s morning, i should really have a muffin. i like those chocolate chip ones. then i figured, well, they\\'re really both cake. so i, uh, i sat on that bench for a little while, twenty minutes or an hour, and then i figured, check and see what you were up to. (a thought occurs to him) wait a minute, wait a minute. the broad jump! the broad jump over the pothole on eighty-sixth street! \\n\\ngeorge: now i remember, as i jumped over the hole i heard a, like a jingling sound. \\n\\njerry: you didn\\'t look down? \\n\\ngeorge: i was trying to stick the landing. (indistinct) ...was right around here. \\n\\ngeorge: no! no!! \\n\\nhead (o.c.): holy, holy cow! \\n\\njerry: poor son of a bitch. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s a hundred thousand revolutions a second. it\\'s the most powerful one they make. \\n\\njenna: it\\'s like i\\'m holding a blender. \\n\\njerry: the engine\\'s made by mcdonnell-douglas. \\n\\njerry: oh no, you keep going. it shuts off automatically. \\n\\njenna: (restarting and reapplying the brush) really, it does? \\n\\njerry: (unheard by jenna) when the battery runs out. \\n\\njenna: (shouting to jerry) i was really happy with my old toothbrush. \\n\\njerry: no, trust me, that one was doing more harm than good. don\\'t forget to use the plax too. \\n\\njenna (o.c.): that stuff tastes like bleach! \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know anything about that. \\n\\njenna: mmm. my mouth feels so clean. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s the idea. \\n\\njerry: you know, maybe we better not. i, i think i\\'m getting a little cold. i don\\'t wanna give you any of my germs. \\n\\njenna: aww. okay. thanks, i guess. \\n\\nelaine: you still couldn\\'t kiss her? \\n\\njerry: she has a taint. i can\\'t see it, but i know it\\'s there. \\n\\nelaine: oh, so now you\\'re finding fault on a sub-atomic level. \\n\\njerry: maybe if i could shrink myself down, like in fantastic voyage, and get inside a microscopic submarine, i could be sure. although if there was something there, it might be pretty scary. course, i would have that laser. \\n\\nelaine: jer, do you see where this is going? \\n\\njerry: being really clean and happy? \\n\\nelaine: jerry, you have tendencies. they\\'re always annoying, but they were just tendencies. but now, if you can\\'t kiss this girl, i\\'m afraid we\\'re talking disorder. \\n\\njerry: disorder? \\n\\nelaine: and from disorder, you\\'re a quirk or two away from full-on dementia. \\n\\njerry: (thoughtful) hmm, that could hurt me. (pointing out of window) hey, there it is. \\n\\nelaine: shall we stop and say hi? \\n\\njerry: nah, we\\'ve seen it. \\n\\nelaine: yeah. \\n\\nkramer: (shouting after car) hey jerry! yeah, i\\'ll see you back at the house! \\n\\nkramer: mile one-fourteen, clean as a whistle. \\n\\nman: yeah? \\n\\nelaine: hi. i\\'m your neighbour, uh, fr... from across the street. and uh, (coughs nervously) i was wondering, if it wouldn\\'t be too much trouble, if i could use your apartment to order some food? \\n\\nman: wha? what d\\'you want? \\n\\nelaine: you see, there\\'s this certain flounder and they won\\'t deliver it to my side of the street. \\n\\nman: wh, when is that? \\n\\nelaine: no, i just need them to deliver it here and i have to be kinda inside is all. \\n\\nman: who are you with? \\n\\nelaine: no, actually i\\'m... i\\'m just kind of hungry. \\n\\nman: who let you in? \\n\\nelaine: well, the lock was broken. you just have to jiggle it, actually. but, i just need like a half an hour to an hour. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s with the signs? \\n\\nkramer: hey, you should see the berkhardt, jerry. my mile is spotless. i mean the big stuff was easy. cinderblocks, air-conditioners, shopping carts (makes sound - fzup!), i just rolled \\'em into the woods. \\n\\njerry: yeah, that stuff\\'s all natural anyway. \\n\\nkramer: (holding up a sign) speed limit, one hundred and sixty-five miles per hour. see? they slipped a one in there. (laughing) those kids with the spray paint, god love \\'em. \\n\\njerry: hey. so, keys? \\n\\ngeorge: no keys. and i been calling the city all day. course there\\'s not really a number to call if you wanna make a pothole. \\n\\njerry: i guess they leave that up to the general population. \\n\\ngeorge: i tell you this. if the real phil rizzuto was down there, this wouldn\\'t be happening! \\n\\njerry: hard to say. \\n\\nkramer: hey, you need some roadwork done? \\'cos i met some maintenance guys today on the highway, they could probably help you out. \\n\\ngeorge: really? \\n\\nkramer: oh yeah, yeah. i borrowed some cones from them when i was sweeping my car-pool lane. \\n\\njerry: yeah? \\n\\njenna (o.c.): it\\'s jenna. \\n\\njerry: if you guys wouldn\\'t mind, i would like to ward off dementia. \\n\\ngeorge: you think you could hook me up with these guys? \\n\\nkramer: oh yeah, yeah. give me a ring tomorrow. i\\'m gonna be at emergency callbox seven-eight-four. \\n\\ngeorge: seven-eight-four. \\n\\njenna: hey. \\n\\njerry: hi. \\n\\njenna: how you feeling? \\n\\njerry: good. my cold\\'s gone, and i\\'ve been looking forwards to kissing you, which i\\'m ready to do now, if you are ready. \\n\\njenna: what?! \\n\\njerry: nothing. i just, i uh, i bruised my lip. i was drinking a celray, and i brought it up too fast and i banged it into my lip, (lower voice and hurriedly) and then i knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and i wasn\\'t able to tell you before you could use it. \\n\\njenna: what? \\n\\njerry: i\\'m sorry. \\n\\njenna: when were you gonna tell me this?! \\n\\njerry: obviously never. \\n\\nkramer: i need the yield sign. \\n\\njerry: kramer, i\\'m kind of in the middle of something. would you get these signs out of here, please? \\n\\nkramer: you could\\'ve introduced me. \\n\\njerry: i wouldn\\'t know where to start. \\n\\njerry: (knocking) hey, jenna. hey! \\n\\njenna: there. now something of yours has been in the toilet. \\n\\njerry: what?! wha... what\\'d you put in there? \\n\\njenna: gotta run. \\n\\njerry: oh, man! \\n\\njerry: (into phone) hello, jenna, did you dunk the spatula? was it the spatula? hello? dammit! \\n\\nelaine: she won\\'t even give you a hint? \\n\\njerry: no. could be anything. the whole apartment\\'s a biohazard. \\n\\nelaine: you know what i bet it is? (points) your remote. \\n\\njerry: yes, that is a definite possibility. \\n\\nelaine: (walking to the couch) or, could be your walkman there. \\n\\njerry: are you just screwing with me? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, i am. \\n\\nkramer: hey ah. \\n\\njerry: hey, how\\'s life on the road? \\n\\nkramer: oh, i\\'m making a difference jerry. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t doubt it. \\n\\nkramer: you should see the smiles on the drivers\\' faces. i mean, you gotta look quick, but they\\'re there. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s this? \\n\\nkramer: well, you know, those annoying little bumps on the lane-lines? (makes noise - bum, bum, bum, bum, bump) \\n\\njerry: isn\\'t that some kind of safety thing? \\n\\nkramer: well, i had to pull \\'em up if i\\'m gonna widen the lanes. \\n\\njerry: what the hell are you talking about? \\n\\nkramer: ah, you know how in planes they got first class? more leg room, better ride? well, i\\'m bringing that concept to mile one-fourteen. \\n\\nelaine: how are you gonna widen the lanes? \\n\\nkramer: well you black out lane-lines one and three, and a four-lane highway becomes a two-lane comfort cruise. (to jerry) so, you got any black paint? \\n\\njerry: (sarcasm) yeah, in my toolshed, next to the riding mower. \\n\\nelaine: (into phone) yuh, i\\'d like an order of supreme flounder, number forty-seven. yeah, apartment one-q. \\n\\njerry: one-q? whose apartment is that? \\n\\nelaine: that\\'s the janitor closet, across the street. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re pretending to live in a janitor\\'s closet, just to get this flounder? \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s better than eating it alone in the restaurant, like some loser. \\n\\nkramer: that stuff is unbelievable. i\\'d eat it out of a dumpster. \\n\\nelaine: (heading to door) how do you know about it? you\\'re not in the delivery zone. \\n\\nkramer: well, newman uses his mail truck to run fish for china panda on the weekends. \\n\\nelaine: well, mine\\'s coming in ten, so... see you boys. \\n\\nkramer: now, where\\'s that tool shed of yours? \\n\\nelaine: hi. sorry, i didn\\'t hear you. i was in the shower. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'ll see you. \\n\\nralph: you costanza? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. thanks for, thanks for coming by fellas. eh, got a set of keys, buried in the pothole. \\n\\nralph: what\\'re the keys doing in there? \\n\\ngeorge: just need to uh, to dig \\'em up. \\n\\nralph: you put \\'em in there? \\n\\ngeorge: nah, nah, it\\'s uh, it\\'s a long story. just uh, try to get it up. \\n\\nralph: bad place to put your keys. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, i know that.

we\\'ll see who can make it in *this* town. \\n\\njerry: what is it she think you can\\'t do? \\n\\ngeorge: find a job. get an apartment. \\n\\njerry: how did you do those things? \\n\\ngeorge: never mind. the\\'re done. all i have to do now is redo them. you know if you take everything i\\'ve ever done in my entire life and condense it down into one day, it looks decent. \\n\\njerry: hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday? \\n\\nkramer: here you go, here you go, check it out. \\n\\njerry: \"the real peterman reality bus tour\". i\\'m confused. \\n\\nkramer: peterman\\'s book is big business. people want to know the stories behind the stories. \\n\\njerry: nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person\\'s life. \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and desert. \\n\\ngeorge: what\\'s desert? \\n\\nkramer: bite-size three musketeers. just like the real peterman eats. \\n\\ngeorge: he eats those? \\n\\nkramer: no. i eat those. i\\'m the real peterman. \\n\\ngeorge: i think i understand this. jay peterman is real. his biography is not. now, you kramer are real. \\n\\nkramer: talk to me. \\n\\ngeorge: but your life is peterman\\'s. now the bus tour, which is real, takes to places that, while they are real, they are not real in sense that they did not *really* happen to the *real* peterman which is you. \\n\\nkramer: understand? \\n\\njerry: yeah. $37.50 for a three musketeers. \\n\\nmr. lippman: elaine. i\\'m in over my head. nobody likes my muffin tops. \\n\\nelaine: so? what do you want me to do about it? \\n\\nmr. lippman: you\\'re the muffin top expert, tell me what i\\'m doing wrong. \\n\\nelaine: mr. lippman, when i worked for you at pendent publishing, i believed in you, you know as a man of integrity. but, i saw you in that paper hat and that aprin... \\n\\nmr. lippman: what if i cut you in for 30% of the profits? \\n\\nelaine: deal. here\\'s your problem. you\\'re making just the muffin tops. you\\'ve gotta make the *whole* muffin. then you... pop the top, toss the stump. taste. \\n\\nmr. lippman: ah. (takes a bite of the top.) mmmmm. ah hah? \\n\\nelaine: yeah. \\n\\nmr. lippman: so what do we with the bottoms? \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t know, give em to a soup kitchen. \\n\\nmr. lippman: that\\'s a good idea. \\n\\nelaine: and one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation point? because, it\\'s not \"top of the muffin *to you!!!*\" \\n\\nmr. lippman: no. no. it is. \\n\\nkramer: hey jerry. what is this? lady gillette? what\\'s going on? \\n\\njerry: what? can\\'t i get a moment\\'s peace? \\n\\nkramer: what are you doing to yourself? \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t stop. alex thinks i\\'m naturally hairless. \\n\\nkramer: you can\\'t keep this up. don\\'t you know what\\'s going to happen? everytime you shave it, it\\'s going to come in thicker and fuller and darker. \\n\\njerry: oh that\\'s an old wives tale. \\n\\nkramer: is it? look at this. \\n\\nkramer: (high pitched voice) look at it! look at it! and it\\'s all me. i shaved there when i was a lifeguard. \\n\\njerry: oh come on. that\\'s genetics. that\\'s not going to happen to me. \\n\\nkramer: won\\'t it? or is it already starting to happen? \\n\\nelaine: wow. look at this. we\\'re cleaning up. \\n\\nlippman: oh, rubin, get me another tray of lowfat cranberry. \\n\\nrebecca: excuse me, i\\'m rebecca demore from the homeless shelter. \\n\\nelaine: oh, hi. \\n\\nrebecca: are you the ones leaveing the muffing pieces behind our shelter? \\n\\nelaine: you been enjoying them? \\n\\nrebecca: they\\'re just stumps. \\n\\nelaine: well they\\'re perfectly edible. \\n\\nrebecca: oh, so you just assume that the homeless will eat them, they\\'ll eat anything? \\n\\nmr. lippman: no no, we just thought... \\n\\nrebecca: i know what you thought. they don\\'t have homes, they don\\'t have jobs, what do they need the top of a muffin for? they\\'re lucky to get the stumps. \\n\\nelaine: if the homeless don\\'t like them the homeless don\\'t have to eat them. \\n\\nrebecca: the homeless don\\'t like them. \\n\\nelaine: fine. \\n\\nrebecca: we\\'ve never gotten so many complaints. every two minutes, \"where is the top of this muffin? who ate the rest of this?\" \\n\\nelaine: we were just trying to help. \\n\\nrebecca: why don\\'t you just drop off some chicken skins and lobster shells. \\n\\nelaine: i think i might. \\n\\nmary anne: i can\\'t believe you found something so quickly. how much you pay? \\n\\ngeorge: $2300. \\n\\nmary anne: ouch. a month? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. \\n\\nmary anne: well, guess that\\'s all right for now, but if you say here for more than a few months, you\\'re a real sucker. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, well i uh got lots of other stuff to show you too. wait till you see the plum job that i landed. \\n\\nmary anne: yeah. we should let this place air out anyway. it smells like the last tenant had monkeys or something. \\n\\nkramer: comming up on the right, if you glance up you can just make out my bedroom window. it\\'s the one that\\'s covered in chicken wire. \\n\\nwoman: hey if you\\'re the real peterman, who come you\\'re wearing those ratty clothes? the\\'re not very romantic. \\n\\nkramer: (over the speaker) well that\\'s your opinion. \\n\\nman 1: can i have another three musketeers? they\\'re rather small. \\n\\nkramer: forget it. okay newman\\'s postal route is around here somewhere. \\n\\nman 2: who\\'s newman? \\n\\nman 3: who cares. \\n\\nman 4: hey fake peterman, let me off. i\\'m nautious. \\n\\nman 1: can i have his candy bar? \\n\\nkramer: ahh. everyone just settle down. we have three hours left on this thing, and i can\\'t drive and argue with you rubes all at the same time. okay. lomez\\'s place of worship is right on the right here. \\n\\njerry: why do i have to go on the tour? \\n\\nkramer: jerry you\\'re a minor celebrity. if you go on this thing, it could create a minor stir. bring that girlfriend of your and i\\'ll only charge to 60 bucks. \\n\\njerry: hey, how\\'s business? \\n\\nelaine: ooh, i\\'ve got stump troubles. the sanitation department won\\'t get rid of them all, i can\\'t get a truck to haul this stuff until next week. meanwhile, i\\'m sitting on a mountain of stumps. \\n\\nkramer: all right, i\\'ve got to hose the puke off the floor of the bus. \\n\\nelaine: bus? wait a minute, wait a minute, bus? you\\'ve got a bus? \\n\\nkramer: yeah. \\n\\nelaine: you got any room on that thing? \\n\\nkramer: yeah there are a few seats still available. \\n\\nelaine: do you think you could transport some stumps for me? i\\'ll make it worth your while. \\n\\nkramer: well, if they don\\'t mind sitting in the back. \\n\\nelaine: no they don\\'t. \\n\\nkramer: are they war veterans? \\n\\nmary anne: wow this is your office. \\n\\nmr. steinbrenner: woah. hello. sorry george, didn\\'t know you got a girl in here. give me a signal on the doornob like a necktie or a sock or something. come on george, help me out. \\n\\nmary anne: mr. steinbrenner, i would like to thank you for taking a chance on a hen supervisor at tyler chicken like our boy george here. \\n\\nmr. steinbrenner: hen supervisor from tyler chicken?

(continuity error: he never actually poured the glass of milk.) he swishes the muffin and the milk together and swollows. he takes another stump.) \\n\\njerry: nah, you had a good run. took them to the world series. \\n\\ngeorge: i got to give the players most of the credit for that. \\n\\njerry: don\\'t sell yourself short. you made all the flight arrangements, hotels, busses. \\n\\ngeorge: no, i don\\'t know who was doing that. \\n\\njerry: so, when you actually did work, what it was that you did? \\n\\ngeorge: they had a pastry cart you wouldn\\'t believe. \\n\\nlanette: here you go. your latt, your cappuccino. \\n\\njerry: maybe i should ask her out? \\n\\ngeorge: she is a good waitress. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s true. maybe i take her to the tony\\'s. \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'re going to the tony\\'s? \\n\\njerry: yeah, i wrote some jokes to the show and they gave me two tickets. \\n\\ngeorge: why didn\\'t you ask me? i know a million theater jokes. \\'what\\'s the deal with those guys down in the pit?\\' \\n\\njerry: they\\'re musicians. that\\'s not a joke. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s a funny observation. \\n\\ngeorge: severance package...the yankees are giving me three months full pay for doing nothing. \\n\\njerry: they did it for three years. what\\'s another few months. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m really going to do something with these three months. \\n\\njerry: like what? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m gonna read a book. from beginning to end. in that order. \\n\\njerry: i\\'ve always wanted to do that... \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m gonna play frolf. \\n\\njerry: you mean golf? \\n\\ngeorge: frolf, frisbee golf jerry. golf with a frisbee. this is gonna be my time. time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin. i proclaim this the summer of george! \\n\\nelaine: ...and then peterman ate it. i never told him. \\n\\nelaine: who\\'s that? \\n\\ndugan: that\\'s sam, the new girl in the counting. \\n\\nwalter: what\\'s with her arms? they just hang like salamis. \\n\\ndugan: she walks like orangutan. \\n\\nelaine: better call the zoo. \\n\\ndugan: reer... \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\nwalter: ssssss... \\n\\ndugan: cat-ty... \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s like she\\'s carrying invisible suitcases. \\n\\njerry: like this?

\\n\\ngeorge: i tell you; i\\'m wiped. \\n\\njerry: so, has the summer of george already started or are you still de-composing? \\n\\ngeorge: de-compressing. \\n\\nkramer: whooa, good morning gentleman and tony says hello to you. \\n\\njerry: you didn\\'t give that thing back? \\n\\nkramer: jerry, it was a whirlwind. they whisked us backstage, the media is sworming, champagne is flowing...whooo! i can\\'t describe how great it is to win. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s because you didn\\'t win. \\n\\ngeorge: \\'scarsdale surprise\\'. that\\'s the musical about that scarsdale diet doctor murder. \\n\\nkramer: featuring the mind-blowing performance of ms. raquel welch! \\n\\njerry: you haven\\'t even seen it. \\n\\nkramer: aah, jerry i\\'m not gonna let you bring me down from this high. i\\'ve been partying all night. i saw the sunrise at liza\\'s! \\n\\ngeorge: what, minelli\\'s!?! \\n\\nkramer: no. \\n\\nelaine: sam, listen i\\'m so sorry about the other day. \\n\\nsam: no, don\\'t apologize elaine. i was thinking that maybe i should swing my arms a little bit more. \\n\\nelaine: see, yeah, that\\'s all i was saying. \\n\\nsam: how\\'s this (sam hits a pen case out of the table), or this (swings a paper holder of the table and starts to clear the table left and right). \\n\\nelaine: well, you seem to be getting a hang of it... \\n\\njerry: hi! \\n\\nlanette: sorry, i\\'m running late. i just lost track of time. \\n\\njerry: no rush. \\n\\nlyle: hey, jerry! what\\'s up?

(leaves.) \\n\\nelaine: oh, no please mr. peterman, she\\'s crazy!

(takes sweater out of his bag.) \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\ngeorge: just put it on! all right now, remember she had her nails done today so remark how you like the color. and if you need me you beep me, all right. here you go, hey, hey, hey, hey...(sprays binaca into jerry\\'s mouth.) go get\\'em you\\'re a tiger! \\n\\njerry: hey george, one second, she\\'s having a party friday night and she wants me to take care of the invitations. \\n\\ngeorge: a little notice would\\'ve helped! how many people? \\n\\njerry: 35, and george, on the invitations... \\n\\ngeorge: i know, i know...don\\'t skimp. go go go go... \\n\\nlanette: right on time, i like that. \\n\\njerry: i like your nails, that is a great color. \\n\\nlanette: love the sweater. \\n\\njerry: this old thing? \\n\\ngeorge: hi, i need some party invitations. \\n\\nclerk: okay, have you been in here before? \\n\\ngeorge: about a year ago. wedding invitations. \\n\\nclerk: right, how did that all work out? \\n\\ngeorge: no complaints. \\n\\nclerk: well, they are arranged according the price. and as i recall...(she flips the sample book all the way to the end.) \\n\\ngeorge: actually, (george flips the book back to the beginning) i\\'ll take these nice glossy ones. \\n\\nraquel: \"you are a fraud dr tarnover. you haven\\'t even been to scarsdale.\" \\n\\nkramer: ms. welch. \\n\\nraquel: who are you? \\n\\nkramer: well, i\\'m cosmo kramer, i\\'m one of the producers. \\n\\nraquel: hello, sidney! no, no i told you i don\\'t want to do that! if you bring it up again i will feed your genitals to a wolf!

\\n\\nkramer: (crashing and banging around) serenity nooooowwwww! \\n\\ngeorge: why couldn\\'t you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls to get your stress out? why did you have to destroy *twenty-five* computers? \\n\\nkramer: (leaving) george, you listen to me. i owe ya one. \\n\\njerry: he\\'s incorrigible. you want to talk about it? \\n\\ngeorge: oh, please don\\'t tell me you love me again, jerry, i can\\'t handle it. \\n\\njerry: george, letting my emotions out was the best thing i\\'ve ever done. sure i\\'m not funny anymore, but there\\'s more to life than making shallow, fairly-obvious observations. how about you? \\n\\ngeorge: all right... here goes... \\n\\nelaine: rabbi, is there anything i can do to combat this shiks-appeal? \\n\\nrabbi: ha! elaine, shiks-appeal is a myth, like the yeti, or his north american cousin, the sasquatch. \\n\\nelaine: well, something\\'s goin\\' on here, \\'cause every able-bodied israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop. \\n\\nrabbi: elaine, there\\'s much you don\\'t understand about the jewish religion. for example, did you know that rabbis are allowed to date? \\n\\nelaine: (about to leave) well, what does that have to do...? \\n\\nrabbi: you know, a member of my congregation has a timeshare in myrtle beach. perhaps, if you\\'re not too busy, we could wing on down after the high holidays? elaine? \\'lainie? \\n\\ngeorge: so, that\\'s it. all of my darkest fears, and... everything i\\'m capable of. that\\'s me. \\n\\njerry: yikes. well, good look with all that. \\n\\ngeorge: where you going? i-i thought i could count on you for a little compassion. \\n\\njerry: i think you scared me straight. \\n\\nelaine: all right, jerome, i\\'m in. \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nelaine: maybe we should get married. maybe everything we need is right here in front of us. jer... let\\'s do it. \\n\\njerry: i tell ya, i don\\'t see it happening. \\n\\nelaine: what?

\\n\\nfrank: he\\'s crazy. his phone wasn\\'t even hooked up. he just liked ringing that bell. \\n\\nestelle: i told you to clean out this garage. i have to put my car in! \\n\\nfrank: this is a place of business. i told you never to come in here. serenity now! \\n\\nestelle: all right... \\n\\ngeorge: dad, you really should lay off the \\'serenity now\\' stuff. \\n\\nfrank: so, what am i supposed to say? \\n\\ngeorge: \\'hoochie mama\\'? \\n\\nestelle: move your crap, i\\'m comin\\' in! \\n\\nfrank: no you\\'re not! hoochie mama! hoochie mama! \\n\\njerry: are you sure you can\\'t stay longer? \\n\\nmorty: no, we just came for the funeral. ` \\n\\nhelen: poor marvin kessler, he went too early. \\n\\njerry: he was 96 years old. \\n\\nmorty: that had nothing to do with it, the man was out of shape. \\n\\nhelen: that\\'s why we joined a program. we walk once around the block three times a week. \\n\\nmorty: and every morning i eat a plum. \\n\\njerry: well, what ever you do, you\\'re wearing me out. \\n\\nhelen: what about you? \\n\\nmorty: yeah, looks like you\\'re getting a little spare tire there, tiger. \\n\\njerry: really? \\n\\nkramer: hey, seinfelds! \\n\\nmorty: hey, mr. kramer! \\n\\nkramer: how long are you staying? \\n\\nhelen: we just came down for a funeral. \\n\\nkramer: oh yeah, yeah i heard, marvin kessler. boy, that makes you think. if he could go... \\n\\nhelen: see you downstairs with the car. \\n\\njerry: are you sure you don\\'t need a hand with that? \\n\\nmorty: no no, the luggage is on the program. i got a brick in here. \\n\\njerry: did you give blood? \\n\\nkramer: no, not giving. hoarding. i\\'m storing it in to a blood bank. just in case. \\n\\njerry: in case of what? \\n\\nkramer: jerry, i know myself. if i\\'m out on the street and it\\'s starts to go down, i don\\'t back off until it\\'s finished. \\n\\njerry: are we finished? \\n\\nkramer: done. \\n\\nvivian: elaine, i\\'m so glad you came out. \\n\\nelaine: yeah... \\n\\nvivian: you haven\\'t seen jimmy for years. \\n\\nelaine: i know, i\\'m glad i got to see him before he hit puberty and got, you know all lurchy and awkward. \\n\\nvivian: actually, i\\'m gonna need someone to look after him tomorrow evening. \\n\\nelaine: tomorrow evening, sure. \\n\\nvivian: do you know anyone responsible? \\n\\nelaine: do i know anyone?? \\n\\nvivian: well, if you think of anybody, give me a call. \\n\\ngeorge: what are you doing? \\n\\ntara: incense, for the mood. \\n\\ngeorge: oh yes, by no means, the mood. let me know if there\\'s anything i can do to lend support to the mood. \\n\\ngeorge: um, cream soda? \\n\\ntara: vanilla. \\n\\nelaine: can you believe that, vivian doesn\\'t think i\\'m responsible? \\n\\njerry: who wants to responsible? when ever anything goes wrong, the first thing they ask is who\\'s responsible for this? \\n\\nelaine: i couldn\\'t raise a kid? come on, i love bossing people around. \\n\\njerry: what happened, i thought you were with tara tonight? \\n\\ngeorge: i was, i had to leave. she lit some vanilla incenses. the smell drove me nuts, all i could think about was food, i had to get out of there. we need some pudding here! pudding! \\n\\nelaine: you just left? what did you tell her? \\n\\ngeorge: i told i had a bus transfer that was only good just for another hour. \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t know, i was starving jerry! \\n\\ngeorge: oh, pudding! you want some? \\n\\njerry: hey, you guys think i\\'m getting a little...chunky? \\n\\ngeorge: what are you kidding? we look great! you know what this pudding needs? the skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it on the stove. \\n\\njerry: elaine, what do you think? \\n\\nelaine: i think you\\'re getting a little pudding under the skin yourself. \\n\\nkramer: my service rates went up? you banks are all the same with your hidden fees and your service charges. well, maybe i\\'ll just take my blood elsewhere, yeah. \\n\\nbank employee: well, we can transfer to another bank for you. \\n\\nkramer: oh, no no no...no more banks. i\\'m keeping my blood in my freezer with...my money! \\n\\ngeorge: so eh, what do you say? \\n\\ntara: i guess we could use some food in our lovemaking. \\n\\ngeorge: ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce, your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey... \\n\\ntara: wait wait wait, pastrami on rye with mustard? \\n\\ngeorge: oh yeah yeah, don\\'t you know they used pastrami in that movie 9? weeks? remember the pastrami scene? \\n\\ntara: no. \\n\\ngeorge: well, maybe it was ghostbusters? where ever it was, it worked! \\n\\njerry: didn\\'t go for it, huh? \\n\\ngeorge: no. \\n\\njerry: so, she didn\\'t appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured meats? \\n\\ngeorge: she tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, it\\'s not a meal, you know? food and sex, those are my two passions. it\\'s only natural to combine them. \\n\\njerry: natural? sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man and a sandwich. \\n\\ngeorge: jerry, i\\'m not suggesting getting rid of the girl. she\\'s integral. \\n\\njerry: maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about satisfying one of somebody else\\'s. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, speaking of which, i found a great way to separate the skin from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges; exacto knife. \\n\\njerry: i told you george, no more pudding. i\\'m starting a purification program. keep all that kind of food away from me. \\n\\ngeorge: well, i guess these would be out of the question. (pulls out two pudding skins in plastic bags.) \\n\\njerry: what the hell is that? \\n\\ngeorge: pudding skin singles. \\n\\nkramer: hey buddy, i\\'m borrowing all your tupperware. \\n\\njerry: oh, why? \\n\\nkramer: i closed down my account at the blood bank. \\n\\njerry: what, it...it\\'s here in the building? \\n\\nkramer: right across the hall. what, you wanna go see? \\n\\njerry: no i don\\'t! in fact, if even one corpuscles of that blood should find it\\'s way across that hall i will freak out on you kramer! freak out. \\n\\nkramer: you know, for a fat guy you\\'re not very jolly. \\n\\nelaine: hey, working out? \\n\\njerry: you know it and i ditched all my junk food. \\n\\nkramer: what the heck is going on here? \\n\\njerry: sorry buddy, clean house. it\\'s all health food. \\n\\nkramer: well, i may have to take it, but i don\\'t have to like it. \\n\\nelaine: vivian left me a message. i guess a certain someone changed her mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other someone. \\n\\njerry: is this about me? \\n\\nelaine: no. \\n\\njerry: oh, then i lost interest. \\n\\nelaine: vivian, hi it\\'s elaine. yeah, i\\'m over at jerry\\'s, i got your message...what? yeah, he\\'s right here, hold on...(hands the phone to kramer.) \\n\\nkramer: for me? go...yeah, what tonight? yeah, i\\'ll be there...yeah later. (puts the phone down) well, somebody\\'s baby-sitting. \\n\\nelaine: you? i\\'m more responsible than you are! \\n\\nkramer: don\\'t be ridiculous. now, if you\\'ll excuse me, i have to go to fill my freezer with my own blood. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, tara! \\n\\nkramer: hello, vivian! oh, this is a nice screen. \\n\\nelaine: kramer... \\n\\nkramer: don\\'t take my money! \\n\\nelaine: it is me, you idiot. hi, all right you\\'ve got to get out of here, i\\'m gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid. \\n\\nkramer: no, i\\'m the baby-sitter. \\n\\nelaine: no no no, you\\'re out, i\\'m in. now, hit the road. \\n\\nvivian: elaine? what are you doing here? \\n\\nelaine: kramer is actually sleeping one off, so i thought that i\\'d help out...(kramer moans from the bushes) what\\'s that, some raccoon or something...(hits kramer with a broom.) \\n\\nvivian: well, i guess this would be all right. jimmy, you remember elaine? she\\'s gonna watch you tonight. \\n\\nelaine: hi jimmy. (jimmy kicks elaine to the shin.) ouch! (the screen door hits her in the head.) \\n\\njerry: hey, what are you doing here? i thought you were baby-sitting at vivian\\'s. \\n\\nkramer: there was an incident. \\n\\njerry: oh no, where\\'s the blood? (opens the fridge) it\\'s in here isn\\'t it? \\n\\nkramer: would you stop it. \\n\\njerry: what is this? \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s jell-o. \\n\\njerry: what about this? this is blood isn\\'t it?! \\n\\nkramer: this is tomato juice, look...(drinks from the bottle.) \\n\\njerry: ooh, you\\'re sick! you\\'re sick!! \\n\\nkramer: will you calm down. i took all my blood down to newman\\'s. he let me put it in his meat freezer. \\n\\njerry: hey, what\\'s going on? who made pudding? \\n\\nkramer: oh yeah yeah, george he came by and made more of those pudding skin singles. they\\'re delicious. \\n\\njerry: damn that george, i told him i don\\'t want this stuff around here anymore... \\n\\nkramer: heads up! \\n\\njerry: aaah... \\n\\njimmy: you\\'re dead, president lincoln! you\\'re dead! \\n\\nelaine: i wish i was dead. \\n\\njimmy: can i have your juice? \\n\\nelaine: as long as you don\\'t put... \\n\\nelaine: thanks for the re-fill. \\n\\nvivian: hey, elaine! how did it go? \\n\\nelaine: oh, he\\'s...he\\'s a joy... \\n\\nvivian: really? some sitter have told me he\\'s bit of a handful. \\n\\nelaine: oh, handful of sunshine. i wish i could do this every day. \\n\\nvivian: oh elaine, that\\'s so good to hear. i\\'ve been having a few health problems lately. \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s not serious, is it? \\n\\nvivian: well, it might be. just in case anything does happen, it\\'s nice to know there\\'s somebody like you around. \\n\\nelaine: oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know. (pours the juice from the bag back to glass.) \\n\\njerry: aah! \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s ok, jerry. i\\'m right here. \\n\\njerry: i can see that! what happened? \\n\\nkramer: that knife, it nicked your jugular. you know jerry, when somebody yells \\'heads up\\', you\\'re not supposed to actually look up. \\n\\njerry: i\\'ll remember that. \\n\\nkramer: anyway, you were lucky that i was there. you lost a lot of blood. \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nkramer: oh yeah, you\\'ve got three pints of kramer in you, buddy. \\n\\ngeorge: three pints of kramer\\'s blood? \\n\\njerry: i can feel his blood inside of me. borrowing things from my blood. \\n\\ngeorge: well, so much for purification week. \\n\\njerry: so, how\\'s the fornicating gourmet? \\n\\ngeorge: doing quite well, thank you. yesterday i had a soft boiled egg and a quickie. you know what? if i could add tv to the equation, that would really be the ultimate. \\n\\njerry: george, we\\'re trying to have a civilization here. \\n\\nelaine: hey. \\n\\njerry: hey, how was baby-sitting? \\n\\nelaine: oh, just great. i found out that vivian has some kind of medical problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of jimmy. \\n\\njerry: oh, i\\'m sure it won\\'t be the worst. \\n\\nelaine: it doesn\\'t matter. if anything happens to her, i\\'m on deck! scissors mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it\\'s a dangerous world. \\n\\ngeorge: she\\'s right, i heard kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on a baby-sitting gig. \\n\\njerry: really? \\n\\nkramer: look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck. it\\'s all bramble, see it\\'s like thicket back there. look, i need somebody to shave it for me, huh? \\n\\njerry: i\\'m not touching that thing. \\n\\nkramer: well, i have to say i\\'m very surprised and disappointed - blood brother. \\n\\njerry: oh, no... \\n\\nkramer: what? jerry, i gave you my blood. listen to your pulse, (takes jerry hand) hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy... \\n\\njerry: kramer, i\\'m not shaving your neck. \\n\\nkramer: so, my blood is not enough. would you like a kidney too, because i\\'ll give it to you? i\\'ll rip it out right here and stack it on the table! \\n\\njerry: all right, all right i\\'ll do it, sit down. \\n\\nkramer: no no no, i don\\'t have time right now. i\\'ll catch you tonight, we\\'ll do sort of an all over kind of thing, all right? \\n\\njerry: hello? \\n\\nhelen: kramer called, he told that you were in a hospital. \\n\\njerry: kramer called you? \\n\\nhelen: he calls every week. are you all right? \\n\\njerry: yes, i\\'m fine. \\n\\nhelen: he says he\\'s fine. \\n\\nmorty: tell him to eat a plum. \\n\\nhelen: jerry, you really have to take better care of yourself. we bought you some session with a personal trainer. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t need a personal trainer.

(heraldic harp sounds as jerry looks at jack\\'s face) \\n\\npostal employee: may i help you? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, i\\'d like to cancel my mail. \\n\\npostal employee: certainly. how long would you like us to hold it? \\n\\nkramer: oh, no, no. i don\\'t think you get me. i want out, permanently. \\n\\nnewman: i\\'ll handle this, violet. why don\\'t you take your three hour break? oh, calm down, everyone. no one\\'s cancelling any mail. \\n\\nkramer: oh, yes, i am. \\n\\nnewman: what about your bills? \\n\\nkramer: the bank can pay \\'em. \\n\\nnewman: the bank. what about your cards and letters? \\n\\nkramer: e-mail, telephones, fax machines. fedex, telex, telegrams, holograms. \\n\\nnewman: all right, it\\'s true! of course nobody needs mail. what do you think, you\\'re so clever for figuring that out? but you don\\'t know the half of what goes on here. so just walk away, kramer. i beg of you. \\n\\nsupervisor: is everything all right here, postal employee newman? \\n\\nnewman: yes, sir, i believe everything is all squared away. isn\\'t it, mr. kramer? \\n\\nkramer: oh, yeah. as long as i stop getting mail! \\n\\ngeorge: (surprising his parents in the kitchen) welcome back. \\n\\nestelle: oh! \\n\\ngeorge: quick for a... catered affair. \\n\\nfrank: i don\\'t know what you mean. \\n\\ngeorge: you ditched me. that\\'s twice. now i demand to know what\\'s going on! \\n\\nfrank: george, we\\'ve had it with you. understand? we love you like a son, but even parents have limits. \\n\\nestelle: the breakups, the firings. and every sunday with the calls. \\n\\nfrank: what my wife is trying to say is that this is supposed to be our time. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m not following. \\n\\nfrank: we\\'re cuttin\\' you lose. \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'re cuttin\\' me loose? \\n\\nfrank: now, if you\\'ll excuse me, i\\'m going to make love to your mother. \\n\\ngeorge: they don\\'t want to see me anymore! \\n\\njerry: but this is what you\\'ve always wanted. \\n\\ngeorge: it is. i\\'m just not ready yet. \\n\\njerry: aw, that\\'s kind of sweet. \\n\\ngeorge: ah, shut up, jerry. my parents think they can ignore me. heh heh. well, they better think again. \\n\\njerry: oh, no. george, please. what are you going to do? \\n\\ngeorge: you remember my cousin rhisa? i\\'m gonna date her. \\n\\njerry: mother of god. \\n\\ngeorge: one little wink. she\\'ll freak out, tell my parents. they\\'ll be all over me. who is this guy? \\n\\njerry: that guy elaine\\'s dating seems really familiar to me. i think he may have been a comedian i worked with one time. wait a minute, what is this? \\n\\njerry: that is the guy! \\n\\ngeorge: elaine\\'s in love with the wiz guy? \\n\\njerry: no, she thinks she\\'s in love with him. but she\\'s just remembering this old commercial. \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s pretty pathetic. \\n\\njerry: i know. they\\'re not even related. \\n\\nelaine: (enters) hey. \\n\\ngeorge: uh... hey. i\\'m gonna get going. \\n\\njerry: hey, have fun at the... family reunion. (george exits) so, what do you know about this jack fellow? \\n\\nelaine: isn\\'t he the best? \\n\\njerry: yeah, nobody beats him. what kind of work does he do? \\n\\nelaine: oh, right now he\\'s a fact checker for new york magazine. it\\'s not much, but it has a certain type of quiet dignity. \\n\\njerry: (turning on the commercial) right, quiet dignity. as opposed to, say, this? \\n\\nelaine: oh, no. \\n\\njerry: oh, yes. \\n\\njerry: (answering the phone) hello? yeah, the van is still for sale. sure, come on buy. \\n\\nkramer: (rushing into jerry\\'s apartment) yeah, i called about the van. \\n\\ngeorge: (at dinner with his cousin) some more merlot?

\\n\\nkramer: (breaking the antenna) hey, hey. take it easy. i\\'m not gonna be pressured. i\\'ll walk away right now. is this thing bent? i\\'m not paying for that. \\n\\njerry: all right, just get out of here. \\n\\nkramer: all right, look. i\\'m going to be honest. i\\'m very interested in the van. \\n\\njerry: ok, fine. \\'what do i have to do to put you in this van today?\\' \\n\\nkramer: (pointing to the newspaper ad) well, i don\\'t really have any money. but it says right here, \\'interesting trades considered\\'. \\n\\njerry: you put that in! \\n\\nkramer: (pulling out an undershirt) and i\\'m glad i did. here. \\n\\njerry: you want to trade me an undershirt? \\n\\nkramer: no, i want to trade you screen legend anthony quinn\\'s undershirt. he took this off to do sit-ups in the park and i nabbed it. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s disgusting. \\n\\nkramer: well, it\\'s my final offer. \\n\\npuddy: you dumped me for some idiotic tv pitchman. \\n\\nelaine: look, i\\'m sorry, puddy. it-it was a mistake. so, let\\'s just put it behind us, and we can continue like this never happened. \\n\\npuddy: gee, i don\\'t know. what if we\\'re out somewhere and you see the maytag repairman. \\n\\nelaine: you\\'re not taking me back? \\n\\npuddy: (leaving) that\\'s right. \\n\\nelaine: he\\'s not idiotic. he\\'s the wiz. and nobody beats him. nobody... \\n\\nkramer: (handing out anti-mail pamphlets) here you go. mail is evil. pass it on. hey, mail blows. fax it to a friend. \\n\\nwoman: why does this dummy have a bucket on its head? \\n\\nkramer: because we\\'re blind to their tyranny. \\n\\nwoman: then shouldn\\'t you be wearing the bucket? \\n\\nkramer: yeah. move along, betty. \\n\\nfrankie: is this, uh, jerry seinfeld\\'s van? \\n\\nkramer: well, not anymore. he traded it to me for some hollywood memorabilia. \\n\\nfrankie: i\\'m, uh, i\\'m so stupid. \\n\\nkramer: what? \\n\\nfrankie: (running away) i\\'m so stupid. uh, excuse me. i\\'m sorry. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, nice to meet you. \\n\\njerry: she\\'s into it? \\n\\ngeorge: she\\'s leaving me dirty messages on my answering machine. \\n\\njerry: so have your parents found out about it? \\n\\ngeorge: she wants to keep it quiet. she... thinks we have a real future together. \\n\\njerry: brave new world, alright. \\n\\nkramer: (entering monk\\'s) hey, you guys. \\n\\njerry: hey, how\\'s the anti-mail campaign going? \\n\\nkramer: oh, it\\'s fantastic. we were out in front of the post office today, and not one person went in. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s sunday. \\n\\ngeorge: why is the mailman wearing a bucket? \\n\\nkramer: huh? well, it symbolizes our persecution. \\n\\ngeorge: then... shouldn\\'t you be wearing the bucket. \\n\\njerry: hey, i want my van keys back. \\n\\nkramer: oh, well. i, uh, thought we made a deal for quinn\\'s t-shirt. \\n\\njerry: are you insane? give \\'em to me. \\n\\nkramer: no, i can\\'t, i can\\'t. see, i told frank he could borrow it. yeah, he wants to move some of george\\'s stuff into storage. \\n\\ngeorge: wait a minute? he\\'s picking up the van tonight? this is perfect. i\\'ll drive rhisa to someplace romantic. then when my father slides the door open, i\\'m in the van kissing his brother\\'s daughter. \\n\\nkramer: oh, listen, jerry. one of your friends came by and he was very upset that i had your wheels. \\n\\njerry: oh, no, not frankie. \\n\\nkramer: well, i didn\\'t catch his name, but then he went running into the park. \\n\\njerry: oh, no, the woods! the hole! \\n\\nkramer: (seeing newman pull up along side him in his truck) hey. \\n\\nnewman: kramer, what the hell are you doing? \\n\\nkramer: i know, i\\'m gonna switch the bucket to something else. \\n\\nnewman: not that! \\n\\nkramer: what? \\n\\nnewman: you\\'re in trouble, kramer. i shouldn\\'t even be talking to you, but i\\'m telling you as a friend. here\\'s how it\\'s going to happen you may be walking. maybe on a crisp, autumn day just like today. when a mail truck will slow beside you, and a door will open, and a mailman you know, maybe even trust, will offer to give you a lift. \\n\\nkramer: are you through? \\n\\nnewman: no! and no one will ever see you again! \\n\\nkramer: are you through? \\n\\nnewman: yes. no, wait! ok, yes. \\n\\nnewman: (seeing postal security officials walking towards kramer) quick! get in! \\n\\nkramer: oh, no, no, no. that\\'s exactly how you said it was going down. \\n\\nnewman: there\\'s another way it can go down, and it\\'s going down right now! \\n\\nkramer: no. you said a mailman i know, and you\\'re a mailman i know! \\n\\nnewman: i know you know, but you don\\'t know what i know. \\n\\nkramer: (being grabbed by the security officials) hey! \\n\\njerry: frankie! frankie! frankie! frankie, is that you? \\n\\nhole digger: my name is edgar. \\n\\njerry: have a nice night. \\n\\nhole digger: thank you. \\n\\nfrankie: (digging a hole, talking to himself, and seeing jerry\\'s van pull up near him) stupid... so stupid! jerry? \\n\\nrhisa: all right, george. i\\'m ready. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, hold on. i\\'m, uh, i\\'m just trying to get a reading on my dashboard compass. where are my parents? \\n\\nrhisa: geor-gie... \\n\\nfrankie: (running up to the van and yelling through the window) is this seinfeld\\'s van? seinfeld\\'s van? seinfeld\\'s van?! \\n\\nrhisa: (hearing frankie as george runs to the back of the van) wait. what\\'s he saying? \\n\\ngeorge: i think he\\'s saying \\'son of sam\\'! oh, my god! \\n\\nrhisa: no, they caught him. \\n\\ngeorge: (running out and away from the van) i knew it wasn\\'t berkowitz! \\n\\nfrankie: (seeing george running away) ohh... \\n\\nelaine: so i told him, \\'hit the road. i\\'m going back with jack.\\' \\n\\njack: elaine, that\\'s the second piece of good news today. \\n\\nelaine: really, what was the first? \\n\\njack: (pulling out his wiz hat) they\\'re bringing me back. yeah. i\\'m the wiz again. \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\njack: (dancing around) i\\'m the wiz! i\\'m the wiz! \\n\\nelaine: well what, what about your fact-checking job? \\n\\njack: (dancing around) oh... here\\'s a fact. uh, i\\'m... the wiz! i\\'m the wiz and noooobody beats me! \\n\\njerry: (finding frankie, in his hole) frankie... come on out of there. \\n\\nfrankie: you hate the van. \\n\\njerry: but i\\'m keeping it. as much as i hate the idea of being a van guy, it\\'s much better than hanging out here with the nocturnal dirt people. \\n\\nfrankie: so, can we go for a ride? \\n\\njerry: yeah, let\\'s just get out of here. \\n\\nhole digger #2: (eyeing the empty hole, and getting into it) are you done with that? \\n\\nfrank: (coming upon the van) good. he left the door unlocked. \\n\\nestelle: why did kramer have to park the van in the woods? \\n\\nfrank: isn\\'t it obvious? there are no parking meters out here. \\n\\nestelle: (looking inside of the van) wow! \\n\\nfrank: (reclining the seats in the van to a bed) hey, look at this. hoochie mama! \\n\\npostmaster general: oh, my goodness. what have they done to you here? \\n\\nkramer: huh? who are you? \\n\\npostmaster general: well, you can just call me henry. \\n\\nkramer: henry atkins? the postmaster general? \\n\\npostmaster general: last time i checked. \\n\\nkramer: henry... can i get out of here now? \\n\\npostmaster general: oh, oh. sit a bit. sit a bit. i mean, after all, i drove all the way up here from d.c. just to talk to you. \\n\\nkramer: oh? \\n\\npostmaster general: i even had to cancel a round of golf with the secretary of state. do you like golf, mr. kramer? \\n\\nkramer: yeah. \\n\\npostmaster general: kramer, i\\'ve been, uh, reading some of your material here. i gotta be honest with you you make a pretty strong case. i mean, just imagine. an army of men in wool pants running through the neighborhood handing out pottery catalogs, door to door. \\n\\nkramer: yeah! ha ha. \\n\\npostmaster general: well, it\\'s my job. and i\\'m pretty damn serious about it. in addition to being a postmaster, i\\'m a general. and we both know, it\\'s the job of a general to, by god, get things done. so maybe you can understand why i get a little irritated when someone calls me away from my golf. \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m very, very sorry. \\n\\npostmaster general: sure, you\\'re sorry. i think we got a stack of mail out at the desk that belongs to you. now, you want that mail, don\\'t you mr. kramer? \\n\\nkramer: sure do! \\n\\npostmaster general: (receiving a salute from kramer) now, that\\'s better. \\n\\nkramer: (seeing newman walk into the office with a bucket on his head, escorted by a security man) geez. newman? \\n\\nnewman: (whimpering) tell the world my story. \\n\\njerry: hey, george! \\n\\ngeorge: jerry! hey, that\\'s the guy! \\n\\njerry: what? george costanza, frankie merman. \\n\\ngeorge: oh. the summer me. \\n\\nfrankie: the winter me. \\n\\njerry: you must be george\\'s cousin. \\n\\nrhisa: girlfriend. \\n\\njerry: all right. \\n\\ngeorge: (seeing jerry\\'s van shaking) what is that? that van\\'s a-rockin\\'. \\n\\njerry: don\\'t go a-knockin\\'. \\n\\nestelle: (after george opens the van door) oh, my god! \\n\\ngeorge: (seeing his parents being intimate) oh, my god! \\n\\nfrankie: now you gotta sell this van. \\n\\njerry: oh, yeah. \\n\\nfrank: what you saw in that van was a natural expression of a man\\'s love for his lady. \\n\\ngeorge: ohhhh... \\n\\nestelle: your father\\'s right. it\\'s beautiful. \\n\\nfrank: and it was safe. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, god... \\n\\nfrank: now if you\\'ll excuse me. once again, your mother and i... \\n\\ngeorge: oh... make it stop. \\n\\njerry: i just think if you borrow my blender you should return it. \\n\\nkramer: well whats the difference -- come on (pats him on the back) -- were like cain and able. \\n\\njerry: yeah, ya know cain slew able. \\n\\nkramer: no he didnt. they were in business together it was dry wall, or somethin. \\n\\njerry: oh, no. \\n\\nkramer: all right then, what was it? \\n\\njerry: well i think able worked hard all summer harvesting his crops, while cain just played in the field. then when winter came, able had all the nuts; cain had no nuts, so he killed him. \\n\\nkramer: the way i remember it, cain, he was a successful doctor, but when he took this special formula, he became mr. able. \\n\\njerry: ya broke my blender, didnt ya? \\n\\nkramer: yeah. well i was trying to make gravel and it just (moves hands around) just didnt work out. \\n\\njerry: i knew it. \\n\\njerry: why were you making gravel? \\n\\nkramer: well ... i like the sound it makes when you walk on it. \\n\\nkramer: aahh, this looks familiar \\n\\njerry: of course. it\\'s garbage. \\n\\nkramer: no, no, no, no. these brown things. the chairs. (hits his hand on the rim) jerry, this is the set from the old merv griffin show! (he climbs into the dumpster) they must be throwing it out. this stuff belongs in the smithsonian! \\n\\njerry: yeah, at least in the dumpster behind the smithsonian. \\n\\nkramer: look at this. boy, one minute elliot gould is sitting on you and the next thing - you\\'re yesterday\\'s trash. \\n\\njerry: come on, kramer, get out of there. \\n\\nkramer: no, no, no. you go on ahead. i\\'m not finished taking this in. oh, jerry look ... merv griffin\\'s cigar. \\n\\njerry: (moans) ohhh (walks away) \\n\\ngeorge: you know i uh, spilled a yogurt smoothie in here two days ago. hm, can\\'t smell anything, can ya? \\n\\nmiranda: banana? \\n\\ngeorge: right. \\n\\nmiranda: george watch out for those pigeons. \\n\\ngeorge: oh they\\'ll get out of the way. you really smell banana? \\n\\nmiranda: (gasp) oh my god.

(jerry spots all the classic toys) \\n\\ncelia: oh yeah the toys. \\n\\njerry: where did you get all these? \\n\\ncelia: my dad was a collector. i inherited them after he died from a long painful bout with \\n\\njerry: super bowl! hey, an original g.i. joe. (picks up both items) with a full frogman suit. \\n\\ncelia: jerry, what are you doing? \\n\\njerry: i\\'m putting this on him and we\\'re going to the sink. \\n\\ncelia: ohhh jerry.

(points at jerry) \\n\\njerry: maybe you just didn\\'t see him. \\n\\nelaine: wha-you never see him. he sidled me again in my office. i was sitting there making cup-a-soup singing that song from \"the lion king\". \\n\\njerry: hakuna matata? \\n\\nelaine: i thought i was alone. \\n\\njerry: that doesn\\'t make it right. \\n\\njerry: see, to me, the hakuna matata is not nearly as embarrassing as the cup of soup... \\n\\nelaine: would you just, let it go? \\n\\nkramer: (from his apartment) hey, jerry! come here a sec! \\n\\nkramer: hey! (moving a chair onto the set) \\n\\njerry: oh my god! \\n\\nkramer: (outstretched arms) it\\'s the merv griffin set.

(walks across the set towards the blue curtain) \\n\\nkramer: all right. well, jerry, we\\'d love to have you back anytime. (stretches his arm out, as if hes reaching out a good-bye) \\n\\nkramer: well, elaine benes! well, it\\'s great to have you!

(with arms crossed, she turns quickly and ) \\n\\njerry: so three dates and she still won\\'t let me play with her toys. \\n\\nkramer: hm, that\\'s interesting. you know someone mentioned to me you were not very happy with your toys, growing up. \\n\\njerry: yeah, that was me. \\n\\nkramer: oh, that\\'s right, right, right. and uh you mentioned that uh, you didn\\'t get a g.i. joe. you had an \\n\\njerry: an army pete. \\n\\nkramer: right. \\n\\njerry: he was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and then split. \\n\\nkramer: and we all know how painful that can be. (as he says this, he turns and speaks directly into the non-existent television camera. jerry looks a bit confused.) \\n\\nelaine: jerry. oh there - - \\n\\nkramer: oh, elaine benes. well, this is quite a thrill, yes. come - - (motions for jerry to move down one seat as the new guest has arrived for her segment. kramer gives jerry a little push) come on sit down. yes. \\n\\nelaine: (clears throat) (to jerry) well, i\\'ll tell ya, this sidler guy is really chapping my hide. \\n\\nkramer: ju - excuse me. yeah we\\'re, talking this way. \\n\\nelaine: well, he\\'s getting credit for work that i did! he\\'s gonna sidle me right out of a job. \\n\\nkramer: ah, now, for those of us who don\\'t know, uh, sidling is what? \\n\\nelaine: kramer, what is wrong with you? \\n\\nkramer: what do you mean? \\n\\nelaine: well, for starters, you\\'re looking at note cards \\n\\nelaine: (to jerry) i\\'m gonna have to give that guy a taste of his own medicine, so, i am going to sidle, the sidler. \\n\\njerry: you, sidle? y-you ... you stomp around like a clydesdale! \\n\\nelaine: not with these honeys. ... wrestling shoes! \\n\\nkramer: (to the imaginary tv camera) only in new york. ... ha ha \\n\\ngeorge: jerry? \\n\\nkramer: oh! (turns on the merv griffin theme music) heeeyy! well, ladies and gentlemen! it\\'s our good friend, george costanza! what a surprise! \\n\\ntape recorder: turn music off (kramer pushes the off button turning the music off) \\n\\nkramer: yeah, sit, sit, sit weeell!

(looking at the yellow note cards) now, uh you and uh, jerry dated for a while. tell us ah ... what was that like? \\n\\nkramer: that was the wrong card. \\n\\ngeorge: i-i don\\'t get these birds! they\\'re breaking the deal. it-it\\'s like the pigeons decided to ignore me! \\n\\njerry: so they\\'re like everyone else. \\n\\nkramer: (laughs too loudly) all right, let\\'s take a short break. \\n\\nkramer: okay ah, (checks his watch) we\\'re back! \\n\\ngeorge: boy that-that bank clock is-is eight minutes off. \\n\\nmiranda: then why don\\'t you just run it over too? \\n\\ngeorge: zing. \\n\\nmiranda: george, what are you doing? \\n\\ngeorge: did you see that? that-that pigeon didn\\'t move! i had to swerve to get out of the way! i saved that pigeons life! \\n\\nmiranda: what pigeon? you drove right into that squirrel. (leaves the car) \\n\\ngeorge: squirrel? well, we have no deal with them! \\n\\njerry: (sound of gunfire) pkew, pkew, pkew, pkew, pkeeew! \\n\\ncelia: jerry! (she slides away from him)  those hands! they never stop! \\n\\njerry: i\\'m sorry. got any booze? what\\'s say you and i get ripped! \\n\\ncelia: no. thanks. i have a headache. can you just get me an aspirin? \\n\\njerry: all right. \\n\\njerry: ohh, will not cause drowsiness\" \\n\\nlou: here\\'s the new copy you wanted. \\n\\npeterman: ah, yes. well this certainly looks like a lot of words. in record time. i\\'m very impressed ... with both of you. \\n\\nelaine: (winks and clicks) thank you. ha ha ha ha. (sits down) \\n\\npeterman: unfortunately, i am also disgusted. this is incoherent drivel! this is a total redo. and i\\'m assuming i need it right away. \\n\\nelaine: well, i guess we\\'ll just have - (lou has left) ohh, just gimme that. (takes the papers and walks away) \\n\\njerry: uhn-uh-uhn - uhn-uh-uhn - - veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer a-ha ha! mission accomplished! back to base, joe. (singing) dee, de-de, de-de-de-de-de (makes g.i. joe swim off, legs kicking) \\n\\nmiranda: doctor is the squirrel going to live? \\n\\ndoctor: there\\'s been massive trauma. we could of course try to save him but, it would be costly, difficult and we\\'d have to send away for some special really tiny instruments. \\n\\ngeorge: well, uh, are there any other options? \\n\\ndoctor: we, could put him to sleep. \\n\\ngeorge: what might that cost? \\n\\ndoctor: well it\\'s by the pound. so ... about 80 cents. \\n\\ngeorge: well? (miranda hits george) i was just - i\\'m curious, that\\'s all. we, uh. we\\'d like you to, do everything possible. \\n\\ndoctor: he, um. he\\'s not going to be the same, you know? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. yeah. i-i know. \\n\\ngeorge: so they\\'re flying the tiny instruments in from el paso. \\n\\nkramer: el paso? i spent a month there one night. \\n\\nnewman: (laughs - t-heheheheheheheh) el paso! \\n\\njerry: what\\'s he here for? \\n\\nnewman: eue-aaa. \\n\\nkramer: ah to take some of the pressure off of me. so, jerry ah, what\\'s going on with you? i understand there\\'s a young lady in your life. mmm. \\n\\njerry: well, actually, it\\'s kind of a funny story because she has this amazing toy collection and last night i finally got to play with them. \\n\\nkramer: well. sounds like things are progressing. do i hear, wedding bells? \\n\\nnewman: are you married right now? (points at jerry) \\n\\nkramer: newman. (kramer smacks newmans arm) \\n\\njerry: actually she doesn\\'t even know about the toys. i gave her the wrong kind of medicine and i, guess she passed out! \\n\\nkramer: what do you mean \"wrong kind of medicine\"? \\n\\njerry: she\\'s even got that old mattel football game that we love! \\n\\ngeorge: oh, come on! you gotta get me over there! \\n\\nkramer: wait a minute, wait a minute! you mean to say that you drugged a woman so you could take advantage of her toys? let\\'s pause a moment. (newman starts the taped music) jerry, now, what you do with your personal life is your business, but when you\\'re on my set - you clean it up, mister! \\n\\nnewman: i told you he was a risk. \\n\\njerry: oh, like he\\'s not just carrying you! and has been for years! \\n\\nnewman: yeah? well, you bombed! that story stunk worse than these chairs! \\n\\nkramer: smile, everyone! we\\'re back! \\n\\nlou: you wanted to see me, elaine? \\n\\nelaine: yes, lou. (exhales) you\\'ve got a lot going for you. you\\'re um ... you\\'re spontaneous. you\\'re, symmetrical. you\\'re, uh, ... (spins around as lou is behind her now) ehh - you\\'re very quick, aren\\'t ya. um, it\\'s just that your... \\n\\nlou: my dead tooth? \\n\\nelaine: no. your. (breathes) \\n\\nlou: not my breath? \\n\\nelaine: uuhhh. \\n\\nlou: what can i do? \\n\\nelaine: well, you should never ever go anywhere, (shakes a box of tic tacs) without these. \\n\\nlou: thanks, elaine. you\\'re such a super lady! (he opens the door and goes into the hall - now he clicks and clacks when he walks) \\n\\ngeorge: more wine and turkey? (pours celia more wine) \\n\\ncelia: hmm. (takes a sip) \\n\\njerry: so when i saw george on the street with an 18 pound turkey and a giant box of wine, i thought ... what a coincidence. we\\'re just about to eat. \\n\\ncelia: what is that stuff in turkey that makes you sleepy? \\n\\njerry and george: tryptophan.* (*footnote - see end of script) \\n\\ncelia: ahh. \\n\\njerry: ... i think. have some more wine. (jerry pours his whole glass of wine into her glass.) \\n\\ncelia: what video did you get? \\n\\ngeorge: oh. \\n\\njerry: oh, george brought home movies of his boyhood trip to michigan. \\n\\ngeorge: four hours. \\n\\njerry: more heavy gravy? \\n\\ngeorge: (playing with toys) ahhhh, yes! touch down! your turn, jerry. (hands jerry the mattel football. george starts playing with the etch-a-sketch.) \\n\\nnewman: lately, though, i\\'ve been, uh, - i\\'ve been buying the generic brand of waxed beans. you know, i rip of the label i can hardly tell the difference. \\n\\nkramer: we\\'ve officially bottomed out, mm. who\\'s our next guest? \\n\\nnewman: we got no one! \\n\\nkramer: we need a new format. we should shut down and re-tool. \\n\\nnewman: what about a guest-host? \\n\\nkramer: i\\'ll pretend i didn\\'t hear that. \\n\\nmiranda: doctor, how\\'s the squirrel? \\n\\ngeorge: is he dead? \\n\\ndoctor: no. fortunately, the special tiny instruments arrived just in time. would you like to visit him? \\n\\nmiranda: yes he would. \\n\\ndoctor: you uh, you have 30 minutes. (doctor exits. george turns and looks towards the doctor) \\n\\ngeorge: so ... uh, squirrel. \\n\\ndoctor: one more thing mister costanza, we just need to know what time you\\'ll be picking him up tomorrow. \\n\\ngeorge: what\\'s that? \\n\\ndoctor: oh, we\\'re discharging the squirrel. we think he\\'ll be better off at home. \\n\\ngeorge: he has no home. he\\'s a squirrel. \\n\\ndoctor: hmm-hm. your home, mister costanza. just make sure he gets his medicine six times a day and keep his tail elevated. (exits) \\n\\njerry: maybe it\\'ll be fun having a pet. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s not a pet! it\\'s a wild invalid! and it knows that i tried to kill it. as soon as it gets better, it\\'s gonna gnaw my brain out in my sleep! \\n\\nkramer: jerry, (claps) aaya - what are you doin\\' tomorrow? i want you to come by the set. \\n\\njerry: what about my \"questionable material\"? \\n\\nkramer: nope, we got a whole new format. edgy, youthful, plus ... we got jim fowler! \\n\\njerry: jim fowler? the animal guy from \"wild kingdom\" is coming to your apartment? \\n\\nkramer: well, i practically raised his kids. \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s perfect! he\\'s a zoo guy! he take\\'s care of animals. c-can i bring the squirrel by? \\n\\nkramer: what? two animal acts on the same show? (turns to jerry) what is this, amateur hour? look, george, i\\'m sorry, maybe another time, all right? (drums table and exits) \\n\\ngeorge: i gotta get to fowler. i know that he would take this squirrel off my hands. it\\'s practically bionic! \\n\\nelaine: hey! (startles jerry and george) ha ha ha ha. nice sidle, huh? speaking, of which i think ive got that problem, solved. \\n\\njerry: tic-tacs work? \\n\\nelaine: he\\'s a human maraca. \\n\\ngeorge: boy, my knuckles are still cramped from that football game. \\n\\nelaine: you took him over to celia\\'s? \\n\\njerry: what? it\\'s a victimless crime. \\n\\nelaine: what about the woman who\\'s been drugged and taken advantage of? \\n\\njerry: okay, one victim. \\n\\nelaine: i think it\\'s unconscionable. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, last night, i found a whole weeble village right behind the ez bake oven. \\n\\nelaine: ez bake oven? \\n\\nelaine: who wants cupcake? \\n\\ngeorge: oh, me, me, me, me, me! \\n\\njerry: you know, that batter is, like, 30 years old. \\n\\nfrank: (on tv) you step on it and it flushes. \\n\\nelaine: why is your father giving a tour of a rest stop? \\n\\nestelle: (on tv) stop squirming. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, don\\'t look. t-this is the part where they change me. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re like eight years old. \\n\\nestelle: (on tv) georgie. \\n\\ngeorge: i was seven and a half. \\n\\npeterman: that noise. that\\'s the noise! \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\npeterman: that infernal rattling sound that has plagued me these past two days - and i could not find the source. in my office, in the hallway. even in the men\\'s room! shame on you, elaine! \\n\\nelaine: no, no, mr. peterman that wasn\\'t me! \\n\\npeterman: that reminds me of the hatian voodoo rattle torture! you haven\\'t gone over to their side have you? \\n\\nelaine: no mister peterman. \\n\\npeterman: because, if i hear one more rattle - just one - your out on your can. and if you are undead - i\\'ll find out about that too. (exits) \\n\\nelaine: (pushes lou into the room) lou! in here! (closes the door) we have to talk. \\n\\nlou: oh, right. \\n\\nelaine: (takes the tic tacs away from lou) ooh, stop it! bad voodoo. you gotta stop using these. \\n\\nlou: why? \\n\\nelaine: because they\\'re turning your teeth green? \\n\\nlou: i only buy the white ones. \\n\\nelaine: o-kay ... well then your teeth are green for a different reason. you just gotta stop carrying these, okay? just ... just mouth wash. \\n\\nlou: i can\\'t. it burns my cankers. \\n\\nelaine: binaca? \\n\\nlou: again. \\n\\nelaine: right, right, cankers. um, i got it! chew gum! \\n\\nlou: i hate gum. the only guy i ever liked came with the mickey mouse gumball machine. they stopped making that 20 years ago. \\n\\nelaine: well, stinky, this is your lucky day. \\n\\nkramer: okay. a little later, we\\'re gonna be talking with animal expert, jim fowler. \\n\\nfowler: where are the cameras? (he has a live hawk perched on his arm) \\n\\nkramer: but first, we\\'re talking with, jerry. (looks down to his yellow note cards) okay, jerry, uh, you uh, you drugged a woman in order to play with her toy, collection. how do you feel about that? \\n\\njerry: it was great! i\\'ve done it a few more time since then. \\n\\nkramer: and she doesn\\'t know anything, about this? \\n\\njerry: no, not a thing. \\n\\nkramer: well, jerry, we have a little surprise for you! come on out, celia! \\n\\ncelia: what kind of a sick twisted creep are you? \\n\\nnewman & kramer: woah. \\n\\njerry: what, what is this? what is she doing here? \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s the new format. scandals and animals. git gt gt. \\n\\ncelia: if you think you can drug me and play with my toys, you got another thing coming, buddy! \\n\\nnewman: go girl! \\n\\njerry: well, what kind of woman drinks an entire box of wine? \\n\\nnewman and kramer: ohhh! \\n\\ngeorge: mister fowler, i-i have a squirrel here that is a miracle of modern science! (laughs) \\n\\nkramer: george i told you we\\'re booked! \\n\\nfowler: careful. hawks and squirrels don\\'t get along together. \\n\\nkramer: ohhh. another interesting confrontation. this could be spicy. yeah, george bring him over. \\n\\ngeorge: uh. \\n\\nfowler: no, you idiot! hawks eat squirrels! \\n\\ngeorge: ahhhh, ahh, ah, ahhh, ahh, ah! \\n\\nkramer: (off camera) are we getting this? \\n\\njerry: so the whole set was destroyed? \\n\\nkramer: well, the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing. \\n\\ngeorge: well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work ... sorry bout the set. \\n\\nkramer: ill tell ya it was a grind having to fill 10 hours a day. i\\'m not sure i was ready to have my own talk show set. \\n\\nmiranda: i got the nut bread, george. let\\'s go. (exits) \\n\\njerry: so the squirrel\\'s gonna make it? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, he\\'s in my bed. i\\'m sleeping on the couch. \\n\\njerry: on the couch? so you\\'re... \\n\\ngeorge: still getting nothing! \\n\\ngeorge: so go ahead pigeons. hu hu hu. laugh it up. i\\'m getting in my car now and the last i heard ... we have no deal! \\n\\ncelia: i\\'m glad you called, elaine. i really needed to talk to someone. \\n\\nelaine: oh well, hey, i dated jerry too. i-i know what a monster he can be. more wine and turkey? \\n\\ncelia: who\\'s he? (lou) \\n\\nelaine: oh, he\\'s nobody. hey, listen, ... let me top that off for ya. (pours her glass of wine into celias glass) \\n\\nelaine: hey. \\n\\njerry: morning. \\n\\nelaine: look, this is crazy, i can\\'t go on like this. \\n\\njerry: but why? \\n\\nelaine: i need some space. \\n\\ngeorge: does that mean i have to go too? \\n\\njerry: you don\\'t think she\\'s just talking to me? \\n\\ngeorge: hey, shut up. \\n\\njerry: you shut up. \\n\\nelaine: i hate this. \\n\\nkramer: you\\'ll get used to it. it\\'s like a grubby scrub. \\n\\nelaine: no, i don\\'t want this anymore. \\n\\njerry: we\\'ll come to work with you. \\n\\ngeorge: and on your dates. \\n\\njerry: and shopping. \\n\\nkramer: and to the bathroom. \\n\\njerry, george & kramer: elaine, elaine, elaine, elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.) \\n\\nelaine: i can\\'t breath...i\\'m sorry...(elaine wakes up) you\\'re killing me! \\n\\n(elaine tries to push her alarm clock showing 3: 30. she realizes, that alarm comes from next door.) \\n\\nelaine: (banging the wall) turn your alarm off!! (screams) \\n\\nkruger: your background is impressive george, but how does it apply to what we do here, at kruger industrial smoothing? \\n\\ngeorge: well, at the yankees it was all about smoothing things over, you know, chiseling away, grinding down. in fact we used to call it \\'the grind\\'. \\n\\nkruger: it says here that you worked at play now for four days? \\n\\ngeorge: that should be 14, let me just...(corrects it with a pen.) \\n\\nkruger: george, i have to honest; i could go either way with you...but what the hell, we need someone, huh. \\n\\ngeorge: you won\\'t regret this, sir. \\n\\nkruger: i don\\'t care. let\\'s find you an office. \\n\\n(kruger leaves and george notices a photograph on the table: kruger\\'s family and george on the background.) \\n\\ngeorge: ...and then when i saw the photo i remembered where i\\'d seen him; the boom box incident. \\n\\njerry: the boom box incident? \\n\\ngeorge: summer of \\'89 i\\'m at the beach. this family sits up next to me. i go in to the surfs and when i come from out, my clothes, my towel, my umbrella, they\\'re all gone. i am furious, i start screaming to these kids demanding my stuff back and finally i lose it; i grab their boom box and i chuck it in to the ocean. \\n\\njerry: seems reasonable. \\n\\ngeorge: then i see my clothes floating out there. the tied took them out, not the kids. \\n\\njerry: even more reasonable. \\n\\ngeorge: so now, the father is screaming at me, he\\'s demanding that i pay for the boom box. finally, i gave them a fake address and got the hell out of there. \\n\\njerry: and that guy is your new boss? \\n\\ngeorge: until that stupid photo jogs his memory. \\n\\nkramer: kruger? that\\'s not kruger industrial smoothing, is it? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. \\n\\nkramer: grinders, sanders, wet stones. they are the ones who botched the statue of liberty job. \\n\\njerry: right, they couldn\\'t get the green stuff off. \\n\\ngeorge: it is a horrible company. there\\'s no management what so ever. i could go hog wild in there. \\n\\nkramer: you now what you do? you sneak that photo out of there for couple of days and get it air brushed. \\n\\ngeorge: like retouched. \\n\\nkramer: you remember that photo of me and gerald ford and i took it in. got that ford right out of there. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, this is good. this kruger guy is clueless. i can\\'t wait to work for him. \\n\\nkramer: look at this. this sandwich is terrible. everywhere you go, they give you this misshaped shardy meat. look at this... \\n\\nkramer: i haven\\'t had a decent sandwich in 13 years. \\n\\njerry: neither have i. \\n\\nkramer: hey, our meat problems are solved. \\n\\njerry: where did you get this thing? \\n\\nkramer: i traded it to my sausage press. look how thin that is, see that\\'s all surface area. the taste has nowhere to hide. \\n\\nelaine: hey. \\n\\nkramer: hey, spice. (gives elaine a piece of meat.) welcome to flavor country. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, that\\'s pretty good. \\n\\njerry: hey, i got a date with that doctor you met. \\n\\nelaine: sara sitarides? \\n\\njerry: mmhu. \\n\\nelaine: oh...(falls in to the sofa.) \\n\\njerry: what\\'s with you? \\n\\nelaine: you remember that next door neighbor of mine, the apartment that always smells like potatoes? \\n\\njerry: your whole building smells like potatoes. \\n\\nelaine: this jackass goes to paris, leaves the alarm on. it\\'s been beeping since 330 this morning. \\n\\nkramer: you know, that happened to lomez, so he blew his neighbor\\'s circuit. \\n\\nelaine: how do you do that? \\n\\nkramer: yeah well, that\\'s easy. just let me finish this mile high and i\\'ll be right with you. oh, and jerry, we are gonna need a case of kaiser rolls. \\n\\njerry: i think we might have one left in the stock room. \\n\\nkramer: this hallway smells like potatoes. \\n\\nelaine: i know, i know, this is it. (points to a door.) \\n\\nkramer: ok, oh, you see this socket it\\'s probably connected to her apartment. so what we\\'ll do, we\\'ll take this paper clip and bend it so it\\'ll short out the entire circuit. here you go... \\n\\nelaine: i think i\\'ll let you do it. \\n\\nkramer: no no no. it\\'s easy, you just...do it quickly. \\n\\nelaine: no, i really don\\'t want to. \\n\\nkramer: well, i don\\'t want to either. \\n\\nelaine: i thought you had done this before. \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s just...it\\'s no picnic. \\n\\nelaine: well, how are we gonna do it? \\n\\nkramer: alright, fine fine, i\\'ll do it. \\n\\nkramer: oh mama. \\n\\nelaine: are you okay? \\n\\nkramer: i will lose that nail. \\n\\nsara: i enjoy the challenge of medicine. naturally you have no idea what it\\'s like to have someone\\'s life depending on you. \\n\\njerry: well, i have this neighbor... \\n\\nsara: a joke. do you have any idea how it feels like to save someone\\'s life? \\n\\njerry: is it anything like hitting a home run in softball? \\n\\nsara: no. \\n\\njerry: cause i hit a whopper last week! \\n\\nclerk: here you go, airbrushed in to sand and sky. \\n\\ngeorge: what did you do here? you took out the wrong guy. \\n\\nclerk: i thought you said you wanted to be out? \\n\\ngeorge: well, i\\'m still here. you took out the other guy! \\n\\nclerk: you\\'ve really lost a lot of hair. \\n\\ngeorge: i am aware! \\n\\nelaine thinking: hmm, the world\\'s best pizza cutter. 76 bucks, how often do i make...oh, i\\'ve gotta buy a book. \\n\\nelaine: the cat. \\n\\njerry: he took out kruger? \\n\\ngeorge: i just pray kruger doesn\\'t realize that it\\'s gone until this guy can fix it up. \\n\\nkramer: this slicer is indomitable. \\n\\njerry: where did you get that butcher\\'s coat? \\n\\nkramer: you buy enough meat, they\\'ll give you anything. \\n\\nelaine: kramer, my neighbor has a cat. when you blew the power, we must\\'ve shut off the automatic feeder. \\n\\nkramer: see, that\\'s the same thing that happened to lomez. \\n\\nelaine: what did he do about it? \\n\\nkramer: well, he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died. \\n\\nelaine: well, this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm. \\n\\nkramer: oh, that\\'s a prickly one. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, how\\'s the doctor date? \\n\\njerry: eh, died on the table. just spent hour and a half making me feel, if i don\\'t save lives, i\\'m worthless. \\n\\nelaine: well, she\\'s very focused. dermatology is her life. \\n\\njerry: dermatology? \\n\\nelaine: yes, she\\'s a dermatologist. \\n\\njerry: saving lives? the whole profession is; eh, just put some aloe on it. \\n\\nkramer: the slicer! elaine, let\\'s go. \\n\\nelaine: where are we going? \\n\\nkramer: the cat. just grab that meat and let\\'s ride. \\n\\ngeorge: when are you going on your next date with her? \\n\\njerry: oh, what\\'s the point? \\n\\ngeorge: what, you\\'re gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that aloe pusher in her place? \\n\\njerry: revenge date? that sound like you more than me. \\n\\ngeorge: this good be so sweet, jerry. saving lives? she\\'s one step away working at the clinique counter! \\n\\njerry: dermatologist? skin doesn\\'t need a doctor! \\n\\ngeorge: of course not! wash it, dry it, move on! \\n\\njerry: you\\'re right. i\\'m gonna call her right now and tell her off. \\n\\ngeorge: no no no no no, this has to be carefully orchestrated. you go to a fancy dinner, flowers... \\n\\njerry: flowers? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, you gotta do it classy (wipes his mouth to his sweater.) \\n\\njerry: so, you\\'ve done this? \\n\\ngeorge: almost. couldn\\'t get the girl go out with me the second time. \\n\\nkramer: i think we are looking half a millimeter. \\n\\nelaine: can it cut that thin? \\n\\nkramer: oh, i\\'ve cut slices so thin, i couldn\\'t even see them. \\n\\nelaine: how did you know you cut it? \\n\\nkramer: well, i guess i just assumed. \\n\\nelaine: hold on kitty, dinner\\'s coming. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, that\\'s a hall of famer. \\n\\nelaine: alright, let\\'s do it. \\n\\nkramer: alright, here we go. yeah, watch that baby slide...(puts a slice of meat under the door.) \\n\\nelaine: come on, come on kitty...(slice disappears) ooh...how about that; it worked! wow, can i borrow that thing for a while?

\\n\\njerry: but the thing you don\\'t realize is that there\\'s good naked and bad naked. naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. hey, there\\'s hanke. \\n\\ngeorge: all right. it\\'s grovel time. \\n\\nhanke: hey, george. jerry. listen, i just got sober, so i\\'ve been going through the twelve steps. \\n\\ngeorge: what are you up to now, uh, step nine?

\\n\\nkramer: (chuckling) oh, jerry, you know i can\\'t do that. \\n\\njerry: (standing in the bathtub) now my sense of it is that you\\'re probably wasting time working piecemeal, first cleaning one area, then another. \\n\\nkramer: well, that\\'s how cats do it. \\n\\njerry: but, when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you want to use gravity. \\n\\nkramer: ok. let\\'s turn the water on now. \\n\\njerry: no, i told you, it\\'s just a dry run. \\n\\ngeorge: (entering jerry\\'s bathroom) well, hanke\\'s moved on to step ten. he was spotted taking personal inventory. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s step ten?

\\n\\npeggy: it\\'s not. good day. \\n\\nelaine: (leaving the room after rubbing peggy\\'s keyboard on her butt, sticking the stapler in her armpit, and coughing on her doorknob) oh. all right. you think i\\'ve got germs?

\\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s right. i\\'m two in the hole! \\n\\njerry: well, i hit the wall yesterday with lady godiva. she did a full body flex on a pickle jar. \\n\\ngeorge: did you explain to her about the good naked and the bad naked?

\\n\\nkramer: i\\'m not! i\\'ll see ya later, buddy. \\n\\npeterman: bad news, people. peggy is home sick. \\n\\nelaine: oh, please. \\n\\npeterman: she\\'s stuffed up, achy, and suffering from intense malaise. \\n\\nelaine: oh, come on, we all have intense malaise. right? \\n\\npeterman: i just spoke with her, elaine. she\\'s in bed. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, let me tell you something this is all in her mind, ok? she is insane. she thinks i made her sick because i coughed on her doorknob, rubbed her stapler in my armpit, and put her keyboard on my butt. yeah, she\\'s a wacko. \\n\\ngeorge: so you\\'re jason hanke\\'s supervisor?

\\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t know. a little thing called step nine? instead of an apology, he was beboppin\\' and scattin\\' all over me. \\n\\nsponsor: i\\'m not sure what you want me to do. \\n\\ngeorge: well, aren\\'t you the boss of him? you shouldn\\'t let him move up! when i was in the cub scouts, i got stuck on weebolos for three years \\'cause i kept losing the pinewood derby. \\n\\nsponsor: you\\'re quite upset, george. \\n\\ngeorge: well, i think you should drop him down to step two. \\n\\nsponsor: admit there\\'s a higher power? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, let him chew on that for a while. \\n\\nsponer: you know george, i think i can help you. we\\'re having a meeting tomorrow. why don\\'t you just come by? \\n\\ngeorge: all right. that\\'s more like it. thank you very much. (giving the sponsor the \\'be strong\\' hand clench) by the way, my uncle was an alcoholic, so... \\n\\nkramer: (on the phone in the shower) lomez, you\\'re not listenin\\'. jerry likes the naked, just some of the things she does when she\\'s naked. calm down, i\\'m on your side. geez. hey, hold on a second. i got a clog, i\\'ll call ya back. \\n\\nmelissa: (naked on the couch) what are you doing?

am i?! \\n\\nleader: please don\\'t call me \\'pinhead\\'. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m losin\\' it! \\n\\njerry: he took you to rage-aholics? why? \\n\\ngeorge: probably because this whole universe is against me! \\n\\njerry: you\\'ve got a little rage. \\n\\ngeorge: i know. and now they want me to bottle it up. it makes me so mad! \\n\\njerry: by the way, my bad naked demo didn\\'t quite work. \\n\\ngeorge: this bread has nuts in it! \\n\\njerry: (seeing elaine enter monk\\'s) oh, great. elaine. what is wrong with my body? \\n\\nelaine: chicken wing shoulder blades. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s it? \\n\\nelaine: no, but that\\'s one problem. why? \\n\\njerry: well, i was walking around naked in front of melissa the other day-- \\n\\nelaine: whoa! walking around naked? ahh... that is not a good look for a man. \\n\\ngeorge: why not? it\\'s a good look for a woman. \\n\\nelaine: well, the female body is a... work of art. the male body is utilitarian, it\\'s for gettin\\' around, like a jeep. \\n\\njerry: so you don\\'t think it\\'s attractive? \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s hideous. the hair, the... the lumpiness. it\\'s simian. \\n\\ngeorge: well, some women like it. \\n\\nelaine: hmm. sickies. \\n\\nkramer: (in the shower, reading an instruction manual) installing your clarkman garbage disposal. dismantle latch hasp beneath main drainage lot. oh, come on, clarkman. \\n\\npuddy: (staring into space, picks up the phone) puddy. \\n\\nkramer: is, uh, david puddy there?

\\n\\nkramer: yeah. \\n\\npuddy: (seeing elaine come in) hey, man, i\\'ll call you back. i\\'ll talk you through it. \\n\\nkramer: oh, ok. well, thanks, buddy. \\n\\nelaine: hey, puddy. \\n\\npuddy: hey, babe, your boss called. you owe five bucks for a balloon bouquet. yeah, he says you can just give it to him tomorrow when you see him. \\n\\nelaine: balloon bouquet? for who? \\n\\npuddy: peggy took a turn for the worst. \\n\\nelaine: peggy. oh, great. i suppose she\\'s still blaming me? \\n\\npuddy: that\\'s what he said. \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t believe this woman. \\n\\npuddy: talk to me, babe. \\n\\nelaine: she\\'s this crazy woman who is convinced that my germs make her sick. \\n\\npuddy: oh, germ-o-phobe. i know what that\\'s about. \\n\\nelaine: huh? \\n\\npuddy: (showing her his necklace) i\\'m a recovering germ-o-phobe. ten years. \\n\\nelaine: what is this symbol? \\n\\npuddy: it\\'s a germ. \\n\\npeggy: elaine, it was very nice of you to bring the man you\\'re currently sleeping with over to talk to me, but i assure you, i don\\'t have any problem with germs. \\n\\npuddy: don\\'t you? elaine. \\n\\npeggy: (flinching away) please! \\n\\npuddy: i know it looks bleak. i\\'ve been there. ten years ago waking up in bed next to a woman like this would\\'ve sent me running for the phisohex. \\n\\npeggy: really? \\n\\npuddy: i still have trouble looking at those disgusting old bedroom slippers she slogs around in. \\n\\nelaine: hey, i\\'ve had those since college. they\\'re bunnies. \\n\\npuddy: they\\'re bacteria traps. \\n\\npeggy: so you... just learned to live with it? \\n\\npuddy: for the most part. \\n\\nelaine: ok, we\\'re broken up for the rest of the day. \\n\\njerry: so i\\'m glad we had a talk and worked this out. don\\'t you feel this is better? \\n\\nmelissa: this is nice. \\n\\njerry: yes, clothes. this is normal. \\n\\nmelissa: hey, what are you doing tomorrow? i was thinking that we could go down... \\n\\nmelissa: jerry? jerry, are you listening to me? \\n\\njerry: oh... yeah. what? i\\'m sorry. \\n\\nmelissa: i wanted to know what you\\'re doing tomorrow. \\n\\njerry: oh, maybe a haircut, and, i don\\'t know, maybe a... \\n\\nkramer: (in the shower, on the phone with jerry) so you broke up? \\n\\njerry: we couldn\\'t carry on a conversation. i kept trying to picture her naked, she kept trying to not picture me naked. \\n\\nkramer: hang on. \\n\\njerry: so what are you up to? \\n\\nkramer: oh, just cooking up a little thank you for puddy. hey, how do you make those radish roses? \\n\\njerry: insert a knife into the center and twist. then, to make it bloom, soak it in water for thirty to forty minutes. \\n\\nkramer: no problem there. \\n\\nhanke: george. thanks for coming down to talk to me. i wanted to see you right away, but my hours here aren\\'t very flexible. i just started yesterday. \\n\\ngeorge: well, i\\'m here. what is it? \\n\\nhanke: well, i talked to my sponsor, and, uh, i\\'ve thought it over, and, you know, my apology at the coffee shop was sarcastic, and rude, and you deserve much better. \\n\\ngeorge: (ready to leave) well, thank you. \\n\\nhanke: you\\'re welcome. \\n\\nkid: (entering the store) can i get a triple minute man mint? \\n\\nhanke: waffle or sugar cone? \\n\\ngeorge: uh, excuse me, uh, um, jason. i don\\'t want to get into a big thing here, but... i\\'m not sure if, technically, what you just said was actually an apology. \\n\\nhanke: what? \\n\\nkid: can you get on that cone? \\n\\nhanke: would you hang on just a second, son? george, what are you talking about? \\n\\ngeorge: well, it\\'s just, all you said was \\'your welcome\\', which is nice. it\\'s very nice. but... i feel i gotta get the apology. \\n\\nkid: is there anybody else here but you? \\n\\nhanke: i\\'m alone, and it\\'s my second day. you know, i don\\'t even think we have that flavor so... george, really, enough, ok? you know, i-i admitted i was wrong, so what more do you want from me? \\n\\ngeorge: i would like an apology. \\n\\nhanke: all right, look, you know-- \\n\\nkid #2: (entering the store) did you try it? \\n\\nkid: no, this guy doesn\\'t know what he\\'s doing. \\n\\nhanke: oh, yes i do. yes, i do. ok?

(thinking to himself) .. first thing i\\'m gonna need is a driver.. \\n\\n[setting: outside h&h bagels] \\n\\nelaine: kramer, the vest just called. \\n\\nkramer: (shocked by the way elaine looks) yama - hama! it\\'s fright night! \\n\\nelaine: oh, yeah, i got a little steam bath. listen, in 10 minutes, i\\'m gonna have my hands on that \"atomic sub\" card. \\n\\nkramer: and? \\n\\nelaine: (embarrassed) free sub.

(they obviously do something to offend him. kramer reacts with a face) geez \\n\\n[setting: dealership back room] \\n\\njerry: (tapping the door you lift to retrieve your candy on the machine) i think the candy comes out over there. \\n\\ngeorge: people can drop change down here, jerry. and theyre too lazy to pick it up. \\n\\njerry: either that, or theyve got a weird little hang-up about lying face-down in filth. why dont you just go to the cashier? \\n\\ngeorge: the cashier is at lunch - which is where id like to be. \\n\\njerry: how much was under there? \\n\\ngeorge: (looking at his finger) i think somethin bit me. i just need another nickel. \\n\\njerry: (while fishing through his pocket for change) hey, puddy thinks i should go for the cd player. what do you think? (hands him a nickel) \\n\\ngeorge: ho, ho, ho! hes got a live one. hes just reeling his big fish in! \\n\\njerry: hey, can i have my dollar back? \\n\\ngeorge: (stingy) its wrinkled. its worthless. \\n\\ngeorge: (as the twix starts to move) ha, ha, ha, ha! (the twix gets stuck in the spindle right before falling. george begins to pound the machine) come on! jump! \\n\\nman: they just put out some more donuts. \\n\\ngeorge: they did? \\n\\nman: (holding his up) last one. \\n\\n[setting: dealership car] \\n\\nkramer: well, just one more errand and we can head back. \\n\\nrick: actually, it looks like were gonna need some gas. \\n\\nkramer: oh? well, how much gas do you think is in there right now? \\n\\nrick: (looking) well, its on \"e\". \\n\\nkramer: you know, rick, oftentimes, jerry - he lends me his car and i find myself in a situation where the car is almost out of gas. but, for a variety of reasons, i dont want to be the one responsible for purchasing costly gasoline. \\n\\nrick: (pointing out) so, you want to know how far you can drive your friends car for free. \\n\\nkramer: (in the spotlight, his voice goes high) well, i make it up to him in other ways. \\n\\n[setting: dealership back room] \\n\\ngeorge: as you will see, the candy bar is paid for, and yet, remains dangling in the machine. (notices that the twix slot is completely empty) hey, its gone. where is my twix? (quickly looks around. his sights fall on the window of a door labeled \"employees only\". the same mechanic from before is eating a candy bar) what?! that guys eatin it! \\n\\nsalesman: well, how do you know that ones yours? \\n\\ngeorge: uh, it was dangling! there were only two left in the machine! he mustve bought one, and gotten both. \\n\\nsalesman: sir, are you gonna buy a car? \\n\\ngeorge: no! (the salesman walks away. he addresses the mechanic through the doors window) hey! hey! i see you! that is my twix! (the mechanic eats the last of the twix, obviously to make george even more angered. it works) oh, ha, ha! ho, ho! \\n\\npuddy: paper jam.. got it! \\n\\nelaine: yay! \\n\\npuddy: (holds his hand up) high-five. (elaine reluctantly slaps it. he turns around, and puts his hand out behind his back) on the flip side. \\n\\nelaine: david, um, i.. \\n\\npuddy: (still holding out his hand) dont leave me hangin. \\n\\nelaine: youre a salesman now - and the high-five is its very grease monkey. \\n\\npuddy: what did i tell you about that? \\n\\nelaine: ah, i, im sorry, but the high-five is just so stupid. \\n\\npuddy: (somewhat hurt) oh yeah? ill tell you whats stupid. you. stupid. \\n\\nelaine: (sarcastically) oh, that is really mature. \\n\\npuddy: yeah? so are you. youre the grease monkey. \\n\\nelaine: (confused at davids attempts at a comeback) uh that doesnt make any sense. i am leaving. \\n\\npuddy: yeah, if you leave, were through. \\n\\nelaine: fine! were through! \\n\\npuddy: oh, so youre leaving? \\n\\nelaine: (while leaving) thats right. (mocking puddy, she puts her hand up) high-five! (turns around, putting her hand behind her back like he had done) on the flip side! (as elaine is leaving, she mutters to herself) takin me to arbys \\n\\njerry: (sees elaine leaving) hey! wh-where are you? \\n\\npuddy: lets finish this up. \\n\\njerry: did you two break up? \\n\\npuddy: (while punching up numbers on a calculator) that chicks whacked. were history. (back to the transaction) i just left out a couple of things uh, rust-proofing \\n\\njerry: \"rust-proofing\"? \\n\\npuddy: (reading off what hes adding up on the calculator) transport charge, storage surcharge, additional overcharge, finders fee \\n\\njerry: \"finders fee\"? it was on the lot! \\n\\npuddy: yeah, thats right. (continues reading off) uh, floor mats, keys \\n\\njerry: keys?! \\n\\npuddy: how ya gonna start it? \\n\\n[setting: dealerships shop] \\n\\ngeorge: excuse me. i believe you just ate my twix bar. it was dangling. and when you purchased your twix bar, you got a little freebie, and you never bothered to ask why, or seek out its rightful owner. \\n\\nmechanic: first of all, it wasnt a twix. it was a 5th avenue bar. \\n\\ngeorge: huh. you must think im pretty stupid. (the mechanic shoots him a look as if he cleary does think hes stupid) that was no 5th avenue bar. i can see the crumb right there in the corner of your lip! now, that-that-that is a cookie - and we all know that twix is the only candy bar with the cookie crunch. \\n\\nmechanic: its uh, its just a little nougat. \\n\\ngeorge: nougat? please. i think ive reached the point in my life where i can tell the difference between nougat and cookie. so lets not just say things that we both know are obvious fabrications. \\n\\nmechanic: (pointing to georges forehead) you know, youre gettin a little vein there.. \\n\\ngeorge: (watching the mechanic leave) i know about the vein! i cant believe this guy.. \\n\\njerry: hey, george! \\n\\ngeorge: hey, starving! (grabs the box from jerry) \\n\\njerry: no, last one. listen, you gotta help me out. elaine and puddy just broke up, hes treatin me just like a regular customer, now! \\n\\ngeorge: i tried to tell you, but you wouldnt listen. no, ho, ho! you were gonna get a deal, huh? theres no laws in this place. anything goes! its thunderdome! \\n\\nsaleswoman: is someone helping you? \\n\\ngeorge: stay back! (runs out of the room, pushing jerry out ahead of him) \\n\\n[setting: dealership car] \\n\\nrick: (trying to look at the gas gauge) where is it now? \\n\\nkramer: theres still some overlap between the needle and the slash below the \"e\". \\n\\nrick: how low are you gonna go? \\n\\nkramer: oh, ive been in the slash many times. this is nothing. youll get used to it. just, (makes a popping sound) put it out of your mind. \\n\\nrick: have you ever been completely below the slash? \\n\\nkramer: well, i almost did once, and i blacked out. when i came to, the car was in a ditch, and the tank was full. i dont know who did it, and i never got to thank them.. \\n\\nrick: (as the car slowly drifts off the road) mr. kramer, the road! \\n\\nkramer: whoop! whoop! \\n\\n[setting: puddys office] \\n\\njerry: (threatening tone) so, listen, puddy. when we first started this deal, i thought things were gonna be different. now, if you want to play hard ball, i got my friend, george, here, and he can play pretty hard ball. (leaving the negotiation to george) george, vein it up. \\n\\ngeorge: all right, puddy, listen, and listen good i need to know the name of that mechanic that walks around here. big guy, a liar. short name. sam? moe? sol?! \\n\\njerry: george! can we focus on the car, here? \\n\\ngeorge: im starving! i can feel my stomach sucking up against my spine. \\n\\npuddy: (handing a sheet of paper to jerry) jerry, i just need your signature here, and well get you that yellow car ready to go. \\n\\njerry: yellow? i wanted black. \\n\\npuddy: i cant give you black at that price. \\n\\njerry: (pleading) george, would you help me, please? \\n\\ngeorge: (standing up) yes. this is wrong! \\n\\njerry: sing it, sister! \\n\\ngeorge: just because a candy bar fails to fall from its perch \\n\\njerry: (exasperated) oh, god \\n\\ngeorge: (losing it) does not imply transfer of ownership. moe, sol, or lem is not gonna get away with this! \\n\\njerry: (to puddy) ill be right back. \\n\\npuddy: okay. \\n\\njerry: hey, george! \\n\\n[setting: dealership car] \\n\\nrick: is it just the angle im looking from? \\n\\nkramer: no, sir. we are down there. \\n\\nrick: oh, this is amazing! oh, ive never felt so alive! \\n\\nkramer: all right, im satisfied. we better get some gas. \\n\\nrick: what? well, we cant stop now. \\n\\nkramer: what do you mean? \\n\\nrick: we have to keep going - all the way back to the dealership. that was the plan. \\n\\nkramer: there was no plan. \\n\\nrick: well, lets make it the plan! lets just go for it! like thelma and louise. \\n\\nkramer: what, they drove to a dealership? \\n\\nrick: no, they drove off a cliff. \\n\\nkramer: you are one sick mama i like it. \\n\\nrick: mr. kramer, the road! \\n\\nkramer: yup! yup! \\n\\n[setting: elaines apartment] \\n\\nelaine: hello? \\n\\njerry: (over the phone) elaine, youve got to get back down to the dealer. puddy is screwin me on this car, which is yellow now! \\n\\nelaine: (jokingly mimicking jerry) who is this? \\n\\njerry: (banging the phone against the booth) elaine! \\n\\nelaine: what?! \\n\\njerry: you gotta get back together with puddy so i can make this deal. \\n\\nelaine: (sarcastically) you know, just that you cared enough to call means so much, jerry. \\n\\njerry: youre gonna get back together, anyway. its thousands of dollars! \\n\\nelaine: oh, i dont know.. \\n\\njerry: come on. then you dont have to see him again til my 15,000-mile check. \\n\\nelaine: well, will you pay my cab fare out there? \\n\\njerry: fine. \\n\\nelaine: and i didnt like that roast beef, so how bout some lunch? \\n\\njerry: no. no lunch. \\n\\nelaine: ill hang this phone up right now! \\n\\njerry: all right! lunch! \\n\\nelaine: ill see ya. (hanging up the phone) \\n\\njerry: bye. (hangs up) \\n\\njerry: (frustrated, he reacts) everybodys ripping me off! \\n\\ngeorge: yes, id like to report a problem with one of your mechanics. \\n\\nwillie: when did you bring the car in? \\n\\ngeorge: (to the man behind him in line) yeah, right im gonna get my car repaired at a dealership. huh! why dont i just flush my money down the toilet? \\n\\nwillie: sir, what, exactly, is the problem? \\n\\ngeorge: one of your guys - kip, or ned, short name - stole my twix candy bar! \\n\\nwillie: are you saying he grabbed your candy bar away from you? \\n\\ngeorge: he might as well have! i caught him, and his face was covered in chocolate and cookie crumbs. \\n\\nwillie: i thought you said it was a twix. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, it was. but he claimed it was a 5th avenue bar. \\n\\nwillie: maybe it was. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, no, no. twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch. \\n\\nwillie: what about the hundred-thousand-dollar bar? \\n\\ngeorge: no. rice and caramel. \\n\\nwillie: nougat? \\n\\ngeorge: no. \\n\\nwillie: positive? \\n\\ngeorge: please. \\n\\nwoman: you know they changed the name from hundred-thousand-dollar bar to hundred-grand? \\n\\ngeorge: all i want is my seventy-five cents back, an apology, and for him to be fired! \\n\\nwillie sr: i remember when you used to be able to get a hershey for a nickel. \\n\\nman: whats the one with the swirling chocolate in the commercial? \\n\\ngeorge: they all have swirling chocolate in the commercial! \\n\\nwillie sr: not skittles. \\n\\nwillie: dad, i told you you could sit here only if you dont talk. \\n\\nwoman: (sitting behind george) you make your father sit here all day? \\n\\nwillie: he likes it! \\n\\ngeorge: all right, do you mind? i have the window!

this is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot. \\n\\ngeorge: and this is the first you\\'re seeing of the coat? \\n\\nelaine: we never dated in winter. \\n\\njerry: you might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer. \\n\\nelaine: oh, i walked by bloomingdale\\'s the other day, and i saw that massage chair we want to get joe mayo as an apartment gift. \\n\\ngeorge: an apartment-warming gift? we got to give presents to people for moving? birthdays, christmas, it\\'s enough gifts. i would like one month off. \\n\\njerry: kramer said it\\'s a perfect gift. that\\'s what we\\'re gettin\\' him. \\n\\ngeorge: all right, but we\\'re not buyin\\' it at bloomingdale\\'s. i will buy it, you pay me back later. i\\'ll sniff out a deal. i have a sixth sense. \\n\\njerry: cheapness is not a sense. \\n\\nelaine: i can\\'t stand joe mayo\\'s parties. you know, the second you walk in, he\\'s got you workin\\' for him. \\'hey, can you do me a favor? can you keep an eye on the ice, make sure we have enough?\\' uh... \\n\\njerry: i had a great time at the last one. i was in charge of the music. i turned that mother out. \\n\\nkramer: hey. \\n\\njerry: hey. \\n\\nkramer: you got any pliers? \\n\\njerry: what, has newman got another army man stuck in his ear? \\n\\nnewman: hilarious. \\n\\nkramer: newman and i are reversing the peepholes on our door. so you can see in. \\n\\nelaine: why? \\n\\nnewman: to prevent an ambush. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, so now i can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies. \\n\\njerry: but then anyone can just look in and see you. \\n\\nkramer: our policy is, we\\'re comfortable with our bodies. you know, if someone wants to help themselves to an eyefull, well, we say, \\'enjoy the show.\\' \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m sorry i can\\'t stay for the... second act. \\n\\njerry: hey, george. here\\'s the model number on that chair, by the way. \\n\\nkramer: mmm... nice wallet. \\n\\nnewman: wallet. \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nkramer: nobody carries wallets anymore. i mean, they went out with powdered wigs. yeah, see here\\'s what you need. just a couple of cards and your bankroll. see, keep the big bills on the outside. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s a five. \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m on the mexican, whoa ohh, radio... \\n\\nsilvio: eh, what are you doing? \\n\\nkramer: hey, silvio. yeah, i\\'m reversing my peephole. \\n\\nsilvio: hey, you know you gotta get permission from me. i\\'m the super. who said you could do that? \\n\\nkramer: well, who says i can do any of the things i do in my place? \\n\\nsilvio: like what? \\n\\nkramer: well, i... uh, nothing. no, i\\'ll, um, i\\'ll switch it back. \\n\\nsilvio: no, no, no, no. no, that\\'s all right. \\n\\nkramer: well, that\\'s good. because, uh, newman and i-- \\n\\nsilvio: newman? he did this, too? \\n\\nkramer: well, yeah. \\n\\nsilvio: i deal with him. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, look at this. this is the same massage chair we\\'re gettin\\' for joe mayo, $60 cheaper. \\n\\njerry: except the store\\'s in delaware. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'ll have \\'em overnight it. \\n\\njerry: maybe cheapness is a sense. you know it is better without this big wallet. it\\'s more comfortable. \\n\\ngeorge: it doesn\\'t matter if it\\'s more comfortable. it\\'s wrong. \\n\\njerry: why? \\n\\ngeorge: because important things go in a case. you got a skull for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for your money. \\n\\njerry: but look at this thing. it\\'s-it\\'s huge. you got more cow here than here. \\n\\ngeorge: i need everything in there. \\n\\njerry: irish money? \\n\\ngeorge: i might go there. \\n\\njerry: show this card at any participating orlando-area exxon station...to get your free \\'save the tiger\\' poster. \\n\\ngeorge: all right, just gimme that. and gimme some of those sweet & lows. \\n\\nkramer: who is it? \\n\\nnewman: it\\'s newman. \\n\\nkramer: what do you want? i\\'m in the middle of something. \\n\\nnewman: i can\\'t believe i\\'m being evicted. \\n\\nkramer: what? what are you talking about? \\n\\nnewman: the reverse peepholes. silvio said i\\'m an agitator and i\\'m out of the building. \\n\\nkramer: no. no, he can\\'t do that. \\n\\nnewman: i\\'m homeless! i\\'m gonna be out on a street corner, dancing for nickels. i\\'ll be with the hobos in the trainyard, eating out of a bucket. \\n\\nkramer: come on, we\\'ll go and talk to him, and we\\'ll straighten this thing out. \\n\\nnewman: uh, you, uh, you better put something on. \\n\\njerry: george, i am loving this no wallet thing. \\n\\ngeorge: a man carries a wallet. \\n\\njerry: you know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think i\\'m onto something. \\n\\njoy mayo: hey, jerry. \\n\\njerry: hey, joe mayo. nice place. \\n\\njoy mayo: thanks. george, can you do me a favor and stay by the phone in case anybody calls and needs directions? \\n\\ngeorge: love to. \\n\\njoy mayo: thanks. jerry... \\n\\njerry: music? \\n\\njoy mayo: actually, can you keep an eye on the aquarium and make sure nobody taps on the glass? \\n\\njerry: but i could do that and the music. \\n\\njoy mayo: oh, no, don\\'t worry about the music. just... have fun! \\n\\njerry: i was ready to get jiggy with it. \\n\\npuddy: hey. \\n\\njerry: hey, elaine. \\n\\nelaine: hey. i think you know dr... zaius. \\n\\njerry: so, elaine, notice anything different about my... pants?

\\n\\ngeorge: i thought we\\'d all sign the picture. \\n\\njoy mayo: elaine... \\n\\nelaine: hey, joe mayo. \\n\\njoy mayo: i need you to be in charge of coats. \\n\\nelaine: oh, fantastic. \\n\\njoy mayo: and puddy, can you make sure no one puts a drink on my...sound system? \\n\\npuddy: sure thing, joe mayo. \\n\\njerry: hi, i\\'m jerry. how do you like my pants? \\n\\nkeri: nice. \\n\\njerry: (talking to george) it\\'s working. (to the girl, who\\'s tapping on the aquarium) don\\'t tap on the glass. \\n\\ngeorge: (answering the phone while walking away) joe mayo\\'s apartment? \\n\\npuddy: (standing guard by the stereo as george walks by him) hey! cocktail off the speaker. \\n\\nelaine: goodbye, dr. zaius. \\n\\nsilvio: why are we in jerry\\'s apartment? \\n\\nkramer: well, i, uh, i like to think of this as my conference room. yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves, and the furniture. \\n\\nsilvio: make it quick kramer, my wife and i are about to go bowling. \\n\\nkramer: oh, well, um, newman thinks that you, uh, evicted him? \\n\\nsilvio: i did. i don\\'t like mr. newman. he is an agitator. \\n\\nkramer: look... i\\'ve known newman all my life, in the building, and you\\'re all wrong about him. he\\'s a model tenant. portly, yes, but smart as a whip. \\n\\nsilvio: ok, on your word he can stay. \\n\\nkramer: all right. \\n\\nsilvio: but... i\\'m gonna keep my eye on him. \\n\\nkramer: well, you won\\'t regret it. \\n\\nsilvio: what\\'s wrong? \\n\\njoy mayo: elaine, thanks for coming. \\n\\nelaine: good working with you. \\n\\npuddy: all right, let\\'s hit the bricks. \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\njoy mayo: hey, i got a coat just like this! \\n\\nelaine: oh. uhhh... \\n\\nelaine: so joe mayo had the same coat. \\n\\ngeorge: and you threw it out the window?

(hands george his cup) \\n\\ngeorge: all right (he smiles weakly at maura) \\n\\njerry: she said no? \\n\\ngeorge: she said no. \\n\\njerry: what did you do? \\n\\ngeorge: what could i do?! we fooled around and went to a movie! \\n\\njerry: george, both parties don\\'t have to consent to a break-up. it\\'s not like you\\'re launching missiles from a submarine and you both have to turn your keys. obviously, you didn\\'t make a convincing case. let me hear your arguments. \\n\\ngeorge: well, i don\\'t really like her. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s good. \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t find her attractive. \\n\\njerry: solid. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'d like to sleep with a lot of other women. \\n\\njerry: always popular. \\n\\ngeorge: sometimes at restaurants she talks to her food \\'ooh, mr. mashed potatoes, you are sooo goood.\\' \\n\\njerry: you have an airtight case! \\n\\ngeorge: and in bed-- \\n\\njerry: i\\'m afraid we\\'re out of time. \\n\\njerry: hey. \\n\\ngeorge: what? \\n\\njerry: check these out. these are jerry lewis\\' old cufflinks that he actually wore in the movie \"cinderfella\". i got \\'em at an auction. \\n\\ngeorge: i got some cufflinks i could\\'ve loaned you. \\n\\njerry: no, jerry lewis is gonna be at this friar\\'s club roast i\\'m goin\\' to next week. now i have an in to strike up a conversation with him. \\n\\ngeorge: you already have an in. you have the same first name!... (no reaction) \\'jerry\\'! \\n\\njerry: oh, that\\'ll intrigue him. \\n\\ngeorge: well, it worked when i met george peppard last week. \\n\\njerry: george peppard has been dead for years. \\n\\ngeorge: well, whoever he was, he knew a lot about the a-team! \\n\\nglenn: so you would choose your last meal based on the method of execution? \\n\\nelaine: right, right. i mean, if i was getting the chair, i\\'d go for something... hot and spicy, you know... thai, maybe mexican. lethal injection, feels like pasta... you know, painless, don\\'t want anything too heavy... \\n\\nglenn: so, um, why don\\'t we get together some time? \\n\\nelaine: oh, sure! why don\\'t you give me your number? \\n\\nglenn: i think it\\'d be better if i called you. \\n\\nelaine: oh. ok. maybe we could grab some lunch sometime. d-do you work around here or-? \\n\\nglenn: mm mm... no, not really. \\n\\nelaine: so, is there anything you can tell me about yourself? \\n\\nglenn: (seductive tone) i think you\\'re very beautiful. \\n\\nelaine: (flattered) oh (laughs) that\\'ll do! (laughs some more) \\n\\njerry: what about puddy? \\n\\nelaine: i haven\\'t talked to him in, like, three weeks... i think it might be over... \\n\\njerry: (unimpressed) so, what\\'s this guy about? \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t know. he wouldn\\'t tell me his phone number, where he worked... i\\'ll bet he\\'s in a relationship. \\n\\njerry: or he\\'s a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity! elaine, you could be dating the green lantern! \\n\\nelaine: which one is he? \\n\\njerry: green suit, power ring. \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t care for jewellery on men (wags her finger disapprovingly) \\n\\nkramer: hey. it happened again. (puts box on counter) another robbery in the building. \\n\\njerry: so you bought a cooler? \\n\\nkramer: no, it\\'s a strongbox to protect my irreplaceables. \\n\\nelaine: and... what would those be? \\n\\nkramer: some taxidermy that\\'s been in my family for generations, my tony, my... military discharge. \\n\\njerry: (doubtful) you were in the army? \\n\\nkramer: y- b-briefly. now, i gotta find a good place to hide this key. because if somebody finds this, they hold the key to all my possessions. (makes a clicking sound) \\n\\nelaine: literally. \\n\\nkramer: (offended) \\'literally\\'? what\\'s that supposed to mean? (then to jerry, before elaine can answer) you mind if i hide this somewhere? \\n\\njerry: no, go ahead. \\n\\nkramer: (stuttering gibberish, gestures that they should leave) a little... privacy, uh? \\n\\njerry: oh, come on! \\n\\nelaine: oh! \\n\\nkramer: come on, jerry, this is a security issue! (elaine laughs) boy, you wouldn\\'t last a day in the army. \\n\\njerry: (walking towards door with elaine) how long did you last? (opens door) \\n\\nkramer: well, that\\'s classified. \\n\\nelaine: hey, what if he\\'s married? \\n\\njerry: kramer?! \\n\\nelaine: no, the green lantern. \\n\\nkramer: (from inside) ok! \\n\\njerry: so, you would date a married guy? that\\'s so hacky. \\n\\nelaine: well, i don\\'t know. i may never marry. it might be the closest i get. \\n\\nkramer: (bangs arm of couch in frustration) you peeked! \\n\\njerry: this is your hiding place?! (elaine laughs) \\n\\nkramer: it was under a spoon! \\n\\ngeorge: and so, for all these reasons, we are officially broken up. (shuts book and reaches for door) thank you, (opens door) and good night. \\n\\nmaura: no, george, we\\'re not. \\n\\ngeorge: (gestures towards book) but i proved it! \\n\\nmaura: i refuse to give up on this relationship. it\\'s like... launching missiles from a submarine. both of us have to turn our keys. \\n\\ngeorge: well, then, i am gonna have to ask you to turn your key. \\n\\nmaura: (assertive) i\\'m sorry, george, i can\\'t do that. \\n\\ngeorge: (shouting) turn your key, maura. turn your key! \\n\\nelaine: so, how is a guy like you not involved? \\n\\nglenn: i might ask you the same thing. \\n\\nelaine: (in her mind) that\\'s true, maybe he\\'s not married. \\n\\nelaine: oh, that is so sweet. \\n\\nelaine: (in her mind, cynical) how long do i have to hold this? \\n\\nglenn: (seeing a woman on the street) oh, no. \\n\\nelaine: who is it? \\n\\nglenn: um, uh, no one, no one. (running with elaine into an alley) here, uh, let me show you a short cut. come on. come on. \\n\\nelaine: (in her mind) married. that\\'s it, i\\'m chucking the flower. (she does) \\n\\nelaine: (shouting up) jerry! jerry! \\n\\njerry: elaine, what are you doin\\' down there? \\n\\nelaine: you didn\\'t hear me buzzing? \\n\\njerry: oh, i guess it\\'s broken! \\n\\nelaine: throw down your key. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s liable to bounce and go into a sewer. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'ll catch it! \\n\\njerry: you\\'ll chicken out at the last second. \\n\\nelaine: ...yeah, you\\'re right. well, will you at least keep me company until somebody comes out? \\n\\njerry: (annoyed) all right. (after a pause) hey, you know what\\'s weird? \\n\\nelaine: huh? \\n\\njerry: i used to be able to have a huge meal and go right to sleep. but i can\\'t anymore. \\n\\nelaine: nodding off!... well, i was right. he\\'s an adulterer. and he\\'s cheating on his wife with me! \\n\\njerry: all right. \\n\\njerry: here! i\\'m gonna try and fix the buzzer. \\n\\nelaine: (from the street) it went in the sewer! (jerry reacts) \\n\\njerry: hey... \\n\\nkramer: (re buzzer box) what are you doin\\'? \\n\\njerry: (waving the key) you jammed your key in here? you shorted out my intercom! \\n\\nkramer: (grabbing the key) you just had to go lookin\\' for it, didn\\'t you? see, you hate it that i have a little secret. anything i do -- oooh, oooh! -- you gotta know all about it. you\\'re so obsessed with me. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m gonna go let elaine in. (kramer reaches out to stop him leaving) \\n\\nkramer: oo, y- what are you doing with her? (jerry ignores him and exits) \\n\\njerry: (in the hallway, hearing the door lock behind him, turns back) kramer! \\n\\nkramer: (from inside) security issue! \\n\\njerry: oh, hey. you got in. \\n\\nelaine: yeah, flirted with the menu guy. here. (hands him a large stack of papers) \\n\\njerry: (taking the menus) oh, thanks. \\n\\nkramer: (clattering inside) that wasn\\'t me! \\n\\njerry: so, he\\'s definitely married, huh? \\n\\nelaine: uh... \\n\\njerry: boy, i would love to have been there when you told him off. \\n\\njerry: oh, come on! \\n\\nelaine: well, he could be a superhero! you should\\'ve seen him run. \\n\\nkramer: (from inside jerry\\'s apartment) ok! (door opens) \\n\\nkramer: all right, jerry. let\\'s see if you can get it in your head that this is not an easter egg hunt for your childish amusement. (shuts door) \\n\\ngeorge: (from the street below jerry\\'s window) jerry! \\n\\njerry: (out of window) george, the buzzer\\'s broken! i\\'ll come down! \\n\\njerry: (putting on his coat to go downstairs, he finds the key in his coat pocket) i believe this belongs to you. \\n\\nkramer: heyyyy! (bangs the table in frustration and grabs the key) \\n\\njerry: (opens the door for george) where did you get that? \\n\\ngeorge: (puzzled) i bought it. (enters lobby) \\n\\nphil: (walking up to get inside after george) thanks. \\n\\njerry: (barring the way) i\\'m sorry. i-i don\\'t know you. \\n\\nphil: what? \\n\\njerry: there\\'s been some robberies in the building. i-i can\\'t let you in. \\n\\nphil: but, i live here! i ran out to buy some birdseed, and-and i forgot my key. \\n\\ngeorge: sounds like a scam. (takes a bite from the granola bar) \\n\\njerry: (shakes his head) i\\'m very sorry. (closing the door on phil. jerry smiles and shrugs apologetically as phil stares at them through the glass) \\n\\ngeorge: so, i broke up with maura. it\\'s done. i\\'m out. \\n\\njerry: great, you\\'re lonely and miserable again. (presses button to call elevator) \\n\\ngeorge: feels right. (cheerfully takes another bite) \\n\\njerry: is that guy still there? (they are side-on to phil who is in the background, still pressed against the glass, aghast) \\n\\ngeorge: (looking at the door) he\\'s starin\\' at us. \\n\\njerry: don\\'t look at him. (phil starts to knock on the door) \\n\\njerry: we don\\'t hear that. (they enter the elevator) \\n\\ngeorge: want a bite? \\n\\njerry: nooo, i don\\'t. (the elevator doors shut) \\n\\ngeorge: (in his mind) i think that ginger ale at the coffee shop is just coke and sprite mixed together. how can i prove it? ah! can\\'t, dammit. (knock at door. george goes to open it) \\n\\nmaura: (cheerily) hey, honey. (she sweeps in, shuts the door behind her, and sits down) \\n\\ngeorge: (still by the door) what? m-maura, what are you doin\\' here? i ended this relationship... twice! \\n\\nmaura: george, you didn\\'t mean that. that was just a fight. \\n\\ngeorge: why does it always seem like i\\'m the only one working at this break-up? \\n\\nmaura: george, i listened to your arguments, and they were rambling and flimsy. i\\'m not convinced. come on, get dressed and let\\'s get some dinner. \\n\\ngeorge: (pauses to consider this then gives in) all right. (starts heading towards bedroom) \\n\\nmaura: (picking up the apple) eww, mr. apple. you have a brown spot. (george freezes, shakes his head, and continues walking) \\n\\nelaine: so, this is your little... love nest? (laughs) \\n\\nglenn: it\\'s nothing special, just a little place i keep. \\n\\nelaine: oh. \\n\\nglenn: ah, should i light a fire? \\n\\nelaine: oh, that sounds... romantic. \\n\\nglenn: i\\'m having a little problem with the heat. um, i got some cardboard out here. (climbing through the window) \\n\\nelaine: (in her mind, anguished) this is wrong. i should go. (there\\'s a knock at the door) \\n\\nglenn: (leaning in) can you get that, please? \\n\\nelaine: oh, sure. \\n\\nwoman: where\\'s glenn? \\n\\nelaine: (guiltily) ah... you\\'re the woman from the street, and i am so sorry. you know, i\\'m not really a home-wrecker. i-i-i-i-i thought he was a superhero. i swear. \\n\\nwoman: lady, i\\'m not his wife, i\\'m his welfare caseworker. is he home? \\n\\nelaine: this is his home? \\n\\nwoman: yes. \\n\\nelaine: so, he\\'s... \\n\\nwoman: (nodding) poor. (elaine mouths \\'oo\\') \\n\\nglenn: (coming back through the window carrying an old chair) i think this will burn! \\n\\njerry: so you do live here. \\n\\nphil: (sulkily) yeah. (jerry has an anguished expression as the elevator doors shut) \\n\\njerry: you live on this floor? \\n\\nphil: yeah. \\n\\njerry: (arriving at apartment, sees phil start to open his apartment door, only one door down from kramer\\'s) so you live right... there. \\n\\nphil: yeah. (enters his apartment) \\n\\njerry: so i guess i\\'ll s-- \\n\\nelaine: he wouldn\\'t give me his number because he doesn\\'t have a phone. (unwrapping a lollipop) he\\'s not married. he\\'s poor. (puts lollipop in her mouth) \\n\\njerry: is he wretchedly poor? does he wear one of those barrels with the straps? \\n\\nelaine: he probably busted it up and burned it for heat. \\n\\njerry: so, when are you giving boxcar willie his walking papers? \\n\\nelaine: how can i end it over money? i feel bad. \\n\\njerry: well, let\\'s think. have you ever dealt with the poor in any other situation? \\n\\nelaine: yes. there was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage cans. \\n\\njerry: good. how did you handle that? \\n\\nelaine: well, we gave him a few bucks, and... now he goes in the alley across the street. \\n\\njerry: same situation. pay him off, and you\\'re clean. \\n\\nelaine: well, i am not paying glenn off to get out of this relationship. wh-what am i supposed to do, just walk into his hovel, and hand him... well, how much do you think it would be? \\n\\ngeorge: (entering monk\\'s) hey. \\n\\njerry: hey, where have you been? \\n\\ngeorge: (sitting down next to jerry) seeing maura. apparently, i was unable to break up beyond a reasonable doubt. \\n\\nelaine: if only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know, things would have been so much simpler. \\n\\ngeorge: who\\'s this, blue arrow? \\n\\nelaine: green lantern. \\n\\njerry: we found out his super power was lack of money. \\n\\nelaine: (not amused) all right. \\n\\njerry: he\\'s invulnerable to creditors. \\n\\nelaine: (annoyed) we get it. (george is laughing) \\n\\njerry: he\\'s the got-no-green lantern. \\n\\nelaine: thank you. (gets up from her seat) \\n\\ngeorge: hey, elaine. maybe his girlfriend is lois loan. \\n\\nelaine: (leaning over to george) ooh, (fake laugh) well crafted. (exits) \\n\\ngeorge: hey, maybe this cheating thing is what i could use to ditch maura. \\n\\njerry: sure, just tell maura you\\'re having an affair. \\n\\ngeorge: she\\'s like a district attorney. if it\\'s not the truth, i\\'ll break under the cross. i actually have to do it. \\n\\njerry: (fidgets like he has no room with george next to him)... could you move over there?! \\n\\ngeorge: hey, you know, there\\'s this secretary at work that always had a crush on me. \\n\\njerry: really? how come you never pursued her before? \\n\\ngeorge: she\\'s too tanned. it\\'s the middle of the winter, she\\'s like a carrot. \\n\\nelaine: (coming back into monk\\'s) did i leave my glasses here? \\n\\njerry: (to elaine, still joking) he can wipe out his checking account in a single bounce! \\n\\nelaine: (leaving again) keep \\'em! (george and jerry savour the joke) \\n\\nkramer: heh. \\n\\njerry: there\\'s a giant parrot in the hallway. \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s phil\\'s. \\n\\njerry: who? \\n\\nkramer: our neighbor that you... turned against. (jerry reacts) anyway, i told him it\\'d be fine with us if he wanted to let it stretch its wings out in the hallway. \\n\\njerry: what\\'d ya tell him that for? \\n\\nkramer: because since you\\'ve been playing god with the front door, i\\'ve been tryin\\' to smooth things out, jerry. in fact, i was just hanging out at his place. \\n\\njerry: really? what\\'s it like? is it nicer than mine? where does he have the couch? \\n\\nkramer: well, i don\\'t know, but the key problem is solved. i hid it at phil\\'s... \\n\\njerry: he let you? \\n\\nkramer: no, he doesn\\'t know. see, i hid it without tellin\\' him. so, uh, (starts walking towards door) phil won\\'t be compulsively looking for it like some people... you! (points at jerry) \\n\\ngeorge: so, you... you say you\\'ve been in the city all winter? \\n\\nloretta: i was in maine for a couple days. (george looks puzzled at how she\\'s so tanned) \\n\\ngeorge: well... (shuts door) heeere we are (puts down his coat and chuckles) \\n\\nloretta: george, i\\'ve always fantasized about jumping into bed with you. \\n\\ngeorge: (excited) ho ho! (gestures and steps towards bedroom but loretta walks the other way to the couch) \\n\\nloretta: but... i don\\'t want to spoil things by sleeping with you too soon. \\n\\ngeorge: (walking back) are you sure? \\'cause it could really help me out of a jam. \\n\\nloretta: i want to build something with you, george. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, not more building. \\n\\nloretta: (sighs) and i won\\'t take no for an answer. (she sits down) \\n\\ngeorge: no? \\n\\nloretta: no. \\n\\ngeorge: (after hesitating, resignedly) all right. (he sits down and smiles unconvincingly at her) \\n\\nelaine: so, uh, what are we doing in this alley, anyway? \\n\\nglenn: it\\'s a surprise. \\n\\nelaine: (giggling) oh. \\n\\nelaine: what are you doing? what is that? \\n\\nglenn: it\\'s a bag of donuts. \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s garbage. \\n\\nglenn: no, no, no, no. when they make the new ones, the old ones come out... right here. \\n\\nelaine: (has had enough) all right, that\\'s it. (rummaging in purse, pulls out her chequebook) how do you spell your last name? \\n\\nglenn: (still looking through the garbage bag) it\\'s a bear claw! you have no idea how rare this is. \\n\\nelaine: (writing out cheque) i\\'ll make it out to cash. how \\'bout two hundred bucks? two-fifty? \\n\\nglenn: (eating the bear claw) oooh! \\n\\nelaine: make it three hundred. \\n\\nglenn: (re the bear claw) you know, elaine, you\\'re the bear claw in the garbage bag of my life. (breaks bear claw in half and offers her a piece) \\n\\nelaine: (touched, she takes it) aw, glenn. \\n\\njerry: hi. is phil here? \\n\\nphil: (from inside the apartment) yeah, i\\'m here. (comes to the door. the caged parrot is visible in the background) \\n\\njerry: phil... hi. i-i know we got off to kind of a bad start. but your bird, which is lovely... by the way, made a mess on my door. \\n\\nphil: and? \\n\\njerry: i thought maybe you\\'d clean it up, or your maid, there. \\n\\nphil: that\\'s my wife. \\n\\njerry: (nodding awkwardly for a moment) all right, i think we\\'re done here. (jerry leaves and phil shuts the door darkly) \\n\\njerry: (in a tuxedo) so, you\\'re in a relationship with a woman you don\\'t like, and you\\'re having an affair with a woman that won\\'t have sex with you. \\n\\ngeorge: this isn\\'t going well. \\n\\njerry: i cannot find my jerry lewis cufflinks. without \\'em, i have no in! \\n\\ngeorge: you don\\'t need the cufflinks! you have the same name! (no reaction) \\'jerry\\'! (heads for door, grabbing his coat) \\n\\njerry: where are you goin\\'? help me look! \\n\\ngeorge: (opening door) it\\'s a big night. i\\'m, uh, ice skating with one, and going to a staged reading of \"godspell\" with the other. \\n\\njerry: which is with who? \\n\\ngeorge: (shaking his head, weary) it doesn\\'t matter. (he leaves) \\n\\nkramer: (entering jerry\\'s apartment, in his own tuxedo) whoo! boy. yeah, you clean up nice. \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t go until i find my cufflinks. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, see? i knew you would lose \\'em. that\\'s why i took \\'em out of your dresser drawer and put \\'em in my strongbox. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re a lifesaver. would you get them, please? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, we\\'ll stop by phil\\'s, we\\'ll pick up the key, uh? \\n\\nkramer: hey, what\\'s going on? \\n\\nphil: fredo is dead. (his wife sobs) \\n\\njerry: that strange portuguese guy that lives next-door to the incinerator? \\n\\nphil: no! my bird. we just got back from the pet cemetery. (starts opening door) \\n\\njerry: oh, phil... mrs. phil. i\\'m so sorry. \\n\\nphil: oh, i\\'ll bet you are! they told us he was poisoned! something in his food. \\n\\njerry: but i, i didn\\'t, i-- \\n\\njerry: kramer, they think i killed fredo! (kramer gestures sympathetically) and who buries a bird? \\n\\nkramer: yeah. just give it to the portuguese guy, and he... puts it in the incinerator. \\n\\njerry: just get the key and let\\'s get out of here. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, yeah. (goes to phil\\'s door) you know, it\\'s a... it\\'s a funny thing about that bird dying. i hid the key in fredo\\'s food dish. whoo! that\\'s a weeeird coincidence. \\n\\njerry: kramer!? (grabbing kramer\\'s arm roughly, pulling him back as he\\'s about to knock) \\n\\nkramer: what? \\n\\njerry: you killed fredo! \\n\\nkramer: (high-pitched) well, fredo was weak and stupid! he shouldn\\'t have eaten that key! \\n\\njerry: kramer, i need those cufflinks, but now they\\'re in the box, and the key is in the bird... what are we gonna do? \\n\\nkramer: you just answered your own question. \\n\\njerry: (frowning in realization) oh, no! \\n\\nkramer: (nodding) i\\'ll get the shovel. (walks towards his apartment, as jerry grimaces at the prospect) \\n\\ngeorge: the, uh, actor that played jesus made some odd choices. \\n\\nloretta: (shaking head, confused) what? \\n\\ngeorge: i mean, uh... i had fun ice skating. \\n\\nloretta: oh. (she smiles, reassured, and nods) \\n\\nmaura: george? \\n\\ngeorge: maura. (starts acting dramatically, looking from maura to loretta and back again) oh, my god! what are you doing here?! \\n\\nmaura: you told me to meet you here for lunch. \\n\\ngeorge: (standing up, still acting) uhh! i\\'m caught in my own web of lies! (holds his hands up in surrender) \\n\\nmaura: (calmly ignoring george) i\\'m maura. (shaking loretta\\'s hand and smiling) \\n\\nloretta: (to maura, also friendly) i\\'m loretta. you want to join us? (maura nods and sits down next to her) \\n\\ngeorge: (laughs hysterically, gesticulating wildly) this is all blowing up in my face! my serious girlfriend, and my torrid love affair have accidentally crossed paths. i have ruined three lives... (grabbing coat) well, i understand if you never want to see me again, so... (points towards door) \\n\\nmaura: george, what we have is too important. we can work through this. \\n\\nloretta: so can we. \\n\\ngeorge: (astounded) what? so, this is still not over? \\n\\nmaura: no. \\n\\ngeorge: you? \\n\\nloretta: no. \\n\\ngeorge: all right. (throws his coat back down on the seat and sits down opposite them) \\n\\nglenn: elaine, wow, a tv, a stereo? \\n\\nelaine: yeah, and i got you a cord of wood, so you won\\'t have to burn \\'em. \\n\\nglenn: oh, my god, alison. you\\'re home early. \\n\\nelaine: who is this? \\n\\nalison: (arms crossed, angry) his wife. \\n\\nelaine: you\\'re... poor and married? \\n\\nglenn: looks like it. \\n\\nalison: who the hell are you? \\n\\nelaine: i guess i\\'m... lois loan. \\n\\njerry: kramer, i can\\'t believe we\\'re grave robbers. \\n\\nkramer: (reading a tombstone) \\'man\\'s best friend\\'. jerry, i want something like that on my tombstone. \\n\\njerry: (seeing fredo\\'s tombstone) oh, my god. here he is. i don\\'t want to dig him up! (hands the shovel to kramer) \\n\\nkramer: (sighs) all right, then you\\'re the one getting the key out of him. \\n\\njerry: (grimaces and takes the shovel back) i\\'ll dig. \\n\\nkramer: listen, i heard that lassie #3 is buried around here. i\\'m gonna go check it out. \\n\\njerry: (hitting metal with the first strike of the shovel) well, that was easy. \\n\\nphil: all right, honey, one last look, then you have to let fredo rest in peace. \\n\\njerry: (with a wild expression) hey, kramer! i dug fredo up, now let\\'s cut him open! \\n\\nphil: (horrified) oh, my god! \\n\\njerry: (after a very awkward pause, cheerily) hey, neighbor. \\n\\ngeorge: all right. i\\'m gonna try givin\\' them fifty-five dollars each... (to elaine) what do you think? \\n\\nelaine: give me forty, you\\'ll never see me again. \\n\\nelaine: (to jerry) so, what are you gonna do? are you gonna live here, or are you gonna move out, or what? \\n\\njerry: (still in tuxedo, tie undone) ah, i\\'ll just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building. \\n\\ngeorge: so, what\\'s in the cooler? (flips open the lid) \\n\\nkramer: oh. well, would you look at that. (puts a gun-shaped hand to his head and goes \\'pop\\') i guess i forgot to lock it. \\n\\njerry: you mean it was open? we desecrated a pet cemetery for nothing? \\n\\nkramer: well, this is one for the books, huh, jerry?... reeeally one for the books! \\n\\ngeorge: when are they gonna learn that any news about china is an instant page-turner? (seeing jerry with a small black device) what\\'s that? \\n\\njerry: it\\'s a wizard electronic organizer for my dad. i\\'m goin\\' to florida for his birthday. \\n\\ngeorge: how much was it? \\n\\njerry: two hundred. but i\\'ll tell him it\\'s fifty. he doesn\\'t care about the gift. he gets excited about the deal. \\n\\ngeorge: where are you gettin\\' a wizard for fifty dollars? \\n\\njerry: ah, i\\'ll tell him i got it on the street, and maybe it\\'s hot. that\\'s his favorite. \\n\\ngeorge: i got a message from the rosses at work today. \\n\\njerry: susan\\'s parents? when\\'s the last time you talked to them? \\n\\ngeorge: at the funeral, give or take. you know, deep down, i always kinda felt that they blamed me for susan\\'s death. \\n\\njerry: why, because you picked out the poision envelopes? that\\'s silly. \\n\\nelaine: (entering monk\\'s with her boyfriend) oh, um... darryl. these are... people i know. jerry, george. \\n\\ndarryl: nice meeting you. ah, i gotta run, elaine. i\\'ll see you later. \\n\\nelaine: ok. \\n\\njerry: still no puddy?

\\n\\npuddy: two and ten, babe. \\n\\nelaine: okay. \\n\\npuddy: don\\'t peel out. \\n\\nelaine: i won\\'t. \\n\\n(elaine peels out and turns on the car stereo. she hears: \"jesus is one, jesus is all, jesus picks me up when i fall...\" elaine changes the stations but all of the presets are set to religious radio stations; \"and he said unto abraham...\", \"amen! amen!\", \"so we pray...\", \"saved!\", \"jey-sus!\" she turns off the radio.) \\n\\nelaine: jesus? \\n\\nkruger: according to our latest quarterly thing,kruger industrial smoothing is heading into the red. or the black, or whatever the bad one is. any thoughts? \\n\\ngeorge: well, i know when i\\'m a little strapped, i sometimes drop off my rent check having forgotten to sign it. that could buy us some time. \\n\\nkruger: works for me. good thinking, george. \\n\\nco-worker #1: alright, george. \\n\\nco-worker #2: way to go man. \\n\\ngeorge: or we don\\'t even send the check and then when they call, we pretend we\\'re the cleaning service. heh heh. \"hello? i sorry, no here kruger.\" \\n\\nkruger: are you done? silly voices, c\\'mon people, let\\'s get real. \\n\\nco-worker #1: good one. \\n\\nco-worker #2: that was bad. \\n\\ngeorge: i had \\'em, jerry. they loved me. \\n\\njerry: and then? \\n\\ngeorge: i lost them. i can usually come up with one good comment during a meeting but by the end it\\'s buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns. \\n\\njerry: showmanship, george. when you hit that high note, you say goodnight and walk off. \\n\\ngeorge: i can\\'t just leave. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s the way they do it in vegas. \\n\\ngeorge: you never played vegas. \\n\\njerry: i hear things. \\n\\nelaine: here\\'s one. i borrowed puddy\\'s car and all the presets on his radio were christian rock stations. \\n\\ngeorge: i like christian rock. it\\'s very positive. it\\'s not like those real musicians who think they\\'re so cool and hip. \\n\\nelaine: so, you think that puddy actually believes in something? \\n\\njerry: it\\'s a used car, he probably never changed the presets. \\n\\nelaine: yes, he is lazy. \\n\\njerry: plus he probably doesn\\'t even know how to program the buttons. \\n\\nelaine: yes, he is dumb. \\n\\njerry: so you prefer dumb and lazy to religious? \\n\\nelaine: dumb and lazy, i understand. \\n\\ngeorge: tell you how you could check. \\n\\nelaine: how? \\n\\ngeorge: reprogram all the buttons, see if he changes them back. you know? the old switcheroo. \\n\\njerry: no, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it with the other person\\'s. \\n\\ngeorge: no, it\\'s doing the same thing to someone that they did to you. \\n\\njerry: yeah, elaine\\'s gonna do the same thing to puddy\\'s radio that the radio did to her. \\n\\ngeorge: well that\\'s the gist of it! \\n\\nelaine: quiet! so where is this sophie? \\n\\njerry: oh, she\\'s picking me up in a few minutes. \\n\\nelaine: how long have you two been together? \\n\\njerry: i dunno. since the last one. oh, here she is. you wanna meet her? \\n\\nelaine & george: nah. \\n\\ngeorge: by the way, how did puddy get back in the picture? \\n\\nelaine: i needed to move a bureau. \\n\\nkramer: hey jerry, you got any pepper? \\n\\nmickey: hey jerry. \\n\\njerry: hey mickey. check the pepper shaker. \\n\\nkramer: yeah. (inhales some pepper then sneezes violently) see? it should sound like that, something like that. \\n\\nmickey: aah-choo. \\n\\nkramer: a little wetter. see, i didn\\'t believe it. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s with the fake sneezing? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, we\\'re going down to mt. sinai hospital, see they hire actors to help the students practice diagnosing. \\n\\nmickey: they assign you a specific disease and you act out the symptoms. it\\'s an easy gig. \\n\\njerry: do medical schools actually do this? \\n\\nkramer: well the better ones. alright, let\\'s practice retching. \\n\\nkramer & mickey: huaahhh!! \\n\\njerry: i think the phone is ringing. \\n\\nkramer & mickey: huaahhh!! \\n\\njerry: would you hold it a second?! thank you, will you get out of here with that stuff? \\n\\nkramer: mickey, dts. \\n\\njerry: hello? \\n\\nsophie: hey. it\\'s me. \\n\\njerry: elaine? \\n\\nsophie: no, it\\'s me. \\n\\njerry: george?? \\n\\nsophie: jerry, it\\'s sophie. i can\\'t believe you don\\'t recognize my voice. \\n\\njerry: oh, i knew it was you, i was joking. i\\'m a comedian. \\n\\nkramer: you got any ipecac? \\n\\njerry: ipecac? kramer, i really think you guys are going too far with this. \\n\\nkramer: no, mickey, he swallowed twelve aspirin. \\n\\njerry: did he overdose? \\n\\nkramer: no, it\\'s just too much. \\n\\nkruger: ...and it gets worse. the team working on the statue in lafayette square kind of over-smoothed it. they ground the head down to about the size of a softball, and that spells trouble. \\n\\ngeorge: alright, well why don\\'t we smooth the head down to nothing, stick a pumpkin under its arm and change the nameplate to ichabod crane? \\n\\ngeorge: (getting up and leaving) alright! that\\'s it for me. goodnight everybody. \\n\\ndr. wexler: in your packet you will find the disease you have been assigned and the symptoms you will need to exhibit. \\n\\nmickey: bacterial meningitis. jackpot! \\n\\nkramer: gonorrhea? you wanna trade? \\n\\nmickey: sorry buddy, this is the \"hamlet\" of diseases. severe pain, nausea, delusions, it\\'s got everything. \\n\\nman: sure. \\n\\nkramer: okay, what do you got? \\n\\nman: the surgeon left a sponge inside me. \\n\\nkramer: good luck with that. \\n\\ngeorge: i knew i had hit my high note so i thanked the crowd and i was gone. \\n\\njerry: what did you do the rest of the day? \\n\\ngeorge: i saw \"titanic\". so that old woman, she\\'s just a liar, right? \\n\\njerry: and a bit of a tramp if you ask me. \\n\\nelaine: hello boys. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, so, did you give that radio the old switcheroo? \\n\\nelaine: i did. \\n\\ngeorge: and the christian rock? \\n\\nelaine: ressurected! and look what i pried off of his bumper, a jesus fish! \\n\\ngeorge: jerry, do you have any fishsticks? \\n\\njerry: no. so you\\'re disappointed he\\'s a spiritual person? \\n\\nelaine: well yeah, i got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, i feel misled. \\n\\ngeorge: i think it\\'s neat. you don\\'t hear that much about god anymore. \\n\\njerry: i hear things. hey, so sophie gave me the \"it\\'s me\" on the phone today. \\n\\nelaine: \"it\\'s me?\" isn\\'t it a little premature? \\n\\njerry: i thought so. \\n\\nelaine: hah. she\\'s not a \"me\". i\\'m a \"me\". \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m against all \"it\\'s me\"s. so self-absorbed and egotistical, it\\'s like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes! \\n\\nkramer: well, i got gonorrhea. \\n\\nelaine: that seems about right. \\n\\nkramer: that\\'s what they gave me. \\n\\ngeorge: they? the government? \\n\\njerry: no, no. he\\'s pretending he\\'s got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose it. \\n\\nkramer: and it\\'s a waste of my talent. it\\'s just a little burning. mickey, he got bacterial meningitis. \\n\\ngeorge: i guess there are no small diseases, only small actors. \\n\\ngeorge: (leaving) alright that\\'s it for me. good night everybody. \\n\\nelaine: what was that? \\n\\njerry: showmanship, george is trying to get out on a high note. \\n\\nkramer: see, showmanship. maybe that\\'s what my gonorrhea is missing. \\n\\njerry: yes! step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back row. \\n\\nkramer: yes, yes i will! i\\'m gonna make people feel my gonorrhea, and feel the gonorrhea themselves. \\n\\nstudent #1: and are you experiencing any discomfort? \\n\\nkramer: just a little burning during urination. \\n\\nstudent #1: okay, any other pain? \\n\\nkramer: the haunting memories of lost love. may i? (signals to mickey) lights? (mickey turns down the lights and kramer lights a cigar) our eyes met across the crowded hat store. i, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher. oh, i pursued and she withdrew, then she pursued and i withdrew, and so we danced. i burned for her, much like the burning during urination that i would experience soon afterwards. \\n\\nstudent #1: gonorrhea?! \\n\\nkramer: gonorrhea! \\n\\njerry: one message. hope it\\'s not from you. \\n\\nanswering machine: \"hey jerry, it\\'s me. call me back.\" \\n\\njerry: sophie. \\n\\ngeorge: she\\'s still doing that? \\n\\njerry: yep. \\n\\ngeorge: alright, i\\'ll tell you what you do. you call her back and give her the \"it\\'s me\", heh? pull the old switcheroo. \\n\\njerry: i think that\\'s a \"what\\'s good for the goose is good for the gander\". \\n\\ngeorge: what the hell is a gander, anyway? \\n\\njerry: (picking up the phone and dialing) it\\'s a goose that\\'s had the old switcheroo pulled on it. hi sophie, it\\'s me. \\n\\nsophie: hey raef. \\n\\njerry: (to george) she thinks it\\'s someone named raef. \\n\\ngeorge: good, let her think it. \\n\\njerry: (into the phone, with a disguised voice) so, what\\'s going on? \\n\\nsophie: not a lot. \\n\\ngeorge: ask about you, ask about you. \\n\\njerry: so, uh, how are things with jerry? \\n\\nsophie: oh, i really like him but, well, i still haven\\'t told him the tractor story. \\n\\njerry: right, right, the tractor story. \\n\\nsophie: are you sick, raef? you sound kinda funny. \\n\\njerry: i sound funny? \\n\\ngeorge: abort! abort! \\n\\njerry: yeah i better get to a doctor, bye. (hangs up) that was close! what drives me to take chances like that? \\n\\ngeorge: that was very real. \\n\\njerry: she said there\\'s some tractor story that she hasn\\'t told me about. \\n\\ngeorge: woah, back it up, back it up. beep, beep, beep. tractor story? \\n\\njerry: beep, beep, beep? what are you doing? \\n\\nelaine: so where do you wanna eat? \\n\\npuddy: feels like an arby\\'s night. \\n\\nelaine: arby\\'s. beef and cheese and do you believe in god? \\n\\npuddy: yes. \\n\\nelaine: oh. so, you\\'re pretty religious? \\n\\npuddy: that\\'s right. \\n\\nelaine: so is it a problem that i\\'m not really religious? \\n\\npuddy: not for me. \\n\\nelaine: why not? \\n\\npuddy: i\\'m not the one going to hell. \\n\\ngeorge: you know what i think? i bet she stole a tractor. \\n\\njerry: no one\\'s stealing a tractor, it\\'s a five-mile-an-hour getaway. we\\'re dancing around the obvious, it\\'s gotta be disfigurement. \\n\\ngeorge: does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need? \\n\\njerry: no, she looks completely normal. \\n\\ngeorge: oh. okay, here it is, i got it. she lost her thumbs in a tractor accident and they grafted her big toes on. they do it every day. \\n\\njerry: you think she\\'s got toes for thumbs? \\n\\ngeorge: how\\'s her handshake? a little firm, isn\\'t it? maybe a little too firm? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know. \\n\\ngeorge: hands a little smelly? \\n\\njerry: why do i seek your counsel? \\n\\nelaine: well i\\'m going to hell. \\n\\njerry: that seems about right. \\n\\nelaine: according to puddy. \\n\\njerry: hey, have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and the doughtnuts and-- \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m not in the mood. \\n\\ngeorge: (to a passing waitress) i\\'ll have some coffee and a doughnut. \\n\\njerry: what do you care? you don\\'t believe in hell. \\n\\nelaine: i know, but he does. \\n\\njerry: so it\\'s more of a relationship problem than the final destination of your soul. \\n\\nelaine: well, relationships are very important to me. \\n\\njerry: maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for all eternity. \\n\\ngeorge: (to the waitress bringing his doughnut) and a slice of devil\\'s food cake. \\n\\ngeorge: hey. where is everyone? \\n\\nkruger: they\\'re all off the project. they were boring. george, you are my main man. \\n\\ngeorge: i am? \\n\\nkruger: i don\\'t know what it is, i can\\'t put my finger on it, but lately you have just seemed \\'on\\'. and you always leave me wanting more. \\n\\ngeorge: this is a huge project involving lots of numbers and papers and folders. \\n\\nkruger: ah, i\\'m not too worried about it. let\\'s get started. \\n\\ngeorge: okay. \\n\\nkruger: george? check it out. (he begins to spin around in his chair) three times around, no feet. \\n\\ngeorge: and? \\n\\nkruger: all me. \\n\\ndr. wexler: alright, and here are you ailments for this week. by the way, mr. kramer, you were excellent. \\n\\nkramer: oh, thank you. \\n\\nmickey: cirrhosis of the liver with jaundice! alright i get to wear make-up! what did you get? \\n\\nkramer: gonorrhea? excuse me, i think there\\'s been a mistake, see, i had gonorrhea last week. \\n\\ndr. wexler: oh, it\\'s no mistake. we loved what you did with it. \\n\\nkramer: i don\\'t believe this, i\\'m being typecast. \\n\\nsophie: i move my knight... here. check. \\n\\njerry: they should update these pieces, nobody rides horses anymore. maybe they should change it to a tractor. \\n\\nsophie: jerry, are you embarrassed that you\\'re losing? \\n\\njerry: losing? you know, yesterday i lost control of my car, almost bought the farm. \\n\\nsophie: bought the farm? \\n\\njerry: tractor! \\n\\nsophie: this is an odd side of you, jerry. i feel uncomfortable. \\n\\njerry: wait, don\\'t go. let\\'s thumb wrestle. \\n\\ngeorge: a scar? \\n\\njerry: a big long scar where her leg would dangle when she\\'s riding a...? \\n\\ngeorge: a tractor. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m sure she\\'s a little self-conscious and doesn\\'t like to talk about it. \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t see why\\'s she more self-conscious about that than her toe thumbs. \\n\\njerry: she doesn\\'t have toe thumbs. \\n\\ngeorge: well, if she keeps horsing around with that tractor-- \\n\\njerry: alright. so how\\'s the two-man operation at kruger? \\n\\ngeorge: two-man? it\\'s all me. kruger doesn\\'t do anything; disappears for hours at a time, gives me fake excuses. this afternoon i found him with sleep creases on his face. the only reason i got out to get a bite today was that he finally promised to buckle down and do some actual work.

\\n\\nkramer: oh, it\\'s no big deal. it\\'s just some guy who\\'s been running around riverside park-pffff. you know, cutting people\\'s heads off. \\n\\njerry: how come i haven\\'t read about this? \\n\\nkramer: well, you know, the police, they\\'ve been having some internal dissension about the name. \\n\\nelaine: really? what\\'re the other titles? \\n\\nkramer: uh, headso...uh...the denogginizer...son of dad. \\n\\njerry: son of dad?

you\\'d think just once i could get a break. god knows i earned it with that score! \\n\\nkramer: well, more bad news jerry. \\n\\nkramer: you know the police, they found another victim of the lopper in riverside park. i saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you. \\n\\njerry: oh, come on. there\\'s a lot of people walking around the city that look like me. \\n\\nkramer: not as many as there used to be. \\n\\ngeorge: no. i need a guy that can rig a frogger machine so that i can move it without losing power, \\'cause i have the high score. h-hello? \\n\\nkramer: you know, george, you\\'re not gonna find an electrician like that in the yellow pages. now, i know just the guy who can do this. \\n\\njerry: another friend? \\n\\nkramer: oh, no, no, no. this guy is no friend. in fact, we don\\'t even get along. \\n\\ngeorge: well, is he good, kramer? \\n\\nkramer: oh, he\\'s the best...and the worst. \\n\\ngeorge: kramer, listen to me. i\\'m never gonna have a child. if i lose this frogger high score, that\\'s it for me. \\n\\nkramer: believe me george, you can count on slippery pete. \\n\\ngeorge: slippery pete? \\n\\nkramer: yeah, i don\\'t care for the name, either. in fact, that\\'s one of the things that we argue about. \\n\\ngeorge: all right, i\\'m gonna find a guy with a truck. glc must live on! \\n\\njerry: come on. \\n\\nkramer: dng-ga-gng-ga-wt. \\n\\njerry: hello?

\\n\\nelaine: no, sir, i can\\'t. \\n\\npeterman: inside that small college boy minifridge is my latest acquisition. a slice of cake from the wedding of king edward viii to wallis simpson, circa 1937, price--$29,000. \\n\\njerry: well lisi, that was another- \\n\\nlisi: lovely evening. \\n\\njerry: really bad meal. i was thinking maybe we should-- \\n\\nlisi: go for a hansom cab ride? \\n\\njerry: call it a night. i\\'ll walk you home. where do you live? \\n\\nlisi: 84th street, right off riverside park. \\n\\njerry: riverside park. \\n\\nlisi: i thought we were going-- \\n\\njerry: back to my place. that\\'s right. \\n\\ngeorge: so you slept with her? \\n\\njerry: she lives right off riverside park. i was scared of the lopper, so i let her stay over. \\n\\ngeorge: and you automatically sleep with her? \\n\\njerry: well, i just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of-- \\n\\ngeorge: finished your thought. \\n\\nelaine: guess what i ate. \\n\\ngeorge: an ostrich burger. \\n\\nelaine: no. a $29,000 piece of cake. peterman got it at the duke of windsor auction. it was the most romantic thing i\\'ve ever eaten. \\n\\njerry: how\\'d it taste? \\n\\nelaine: a little stale. \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge (nudges elaine with his elbow): so, uh are you sleeping with peterman? \\n\\nelaine (nudges george with her elbow): no. he doesn\\'t know i ate it. in fact, he almost caught me. i have to sneak back in and even it out. \\n\\ngeorge: you know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more of it. \\n\\nelaine: hey, so i talked to lisi and she has got a big surprise for you. she\\'s planning a weekend trip to pennsylvania dutch country. \\n\\njerry: pennsylvania dutch country? oh, that\\'s the serious relationship weekend place. \\n\\nelaine: what is going on with you two? \\n\\njerry: well, i think by sleeping with her, i may have sent her the wrong message. \\n\\ngeorge: what\\'s that? \\n\\nelaine: 400 sugar fix. \\n\\njerry: well, i\\'m calling this off right now. \\n\\nelaine: no, no. you are way past the phone call breakup stage. \\n\\njerry: well, i\\'m not going over there. that\\'s where the lopper is. \\n\\nelaine: oh...it\\'s daylight. it won\\'t take you that long. just make a clean break. \\n\\nelaine: just a little off the side... \\n\\nelaine: well, no point in wasting $1,200. \\n\\nelaine (thinking): oh, commander, isn\\'t the wedding marvelous? more cake? oh, i shouldn\\'t. i mustn\\'t. ah, what the hell? \\n\\ngeorge: now, each of you is here because you\\'re the best at what you do. \\n\\ngeorge: slippery pete, kramer tells me you are one hell of a rogue electrician. and shlomo, you\\'re the best truck driver. \\n\\nshlomo: i don\\'t know if i\\'m the best. \\n\\ngeorge: oh...you\\'re very good. \\n\\nshlomo: let\\'s say \"good.\" \\n\\ngeorge: ok. good. and kramer, you\\'re in charge of taping off the loading zone. \\n\\nkramer: lock and load. \\n\\nslippery pete: you think you can handle that, numb nuts?

what is that? \\n\\njerry: that\\'s the new area code. they\\'ve run out of 242s, so all the new numbers are 646. \\n\\nelaine: i was a 718 when i first moved here. i cried every night. \\n\\nkramer: listen. heads up, elaine. i\\'m gonna have to stop by later and pick up a fax. \\n\\nelaine: at work? \\n\\nkramer: no. at your apartment. \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t have a fax machine. \\n\\njerry: here we go. \\n\\nkramer: well, now what are we gonna do? (to jerry) see? this is why you should get a fax and a xerox. \\n\\njerry: and a dead bolt. \\n\\nelaine: then maybe you have a fax machine. \\n\\nkramer: you just blew my mind. \\n\\nkruger: let\\'s order lunch. \\n\\nkruger: mary, i will have a chef\\'s salad. \\n\\nmale worker: turkey sandwich. \\n\\ngeorge: t-bone steak. \\n\\nkruger: for lunch?

\\n\\nelaine: you are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep with you. \\n\\njerry: no. i pay her to clean. the rest is-- \\n\\nelaine: what? a health plan? \\n\\njerry: i was going to say, \"being a good host.\" \\n\\nelaine: oh-ho-ho. oh. \\n\\njerry: but the point is we have our personal relationship, and we have our work relationship. they\\'re separate and, i think, some what sophisticated. \\n\\nelaine: so you consider this a relationship? \\n\\njerry: yes, i do. \\n\\nelaine: oh. have you been out? \\n\\njerry: yes, we have. \\n\\nelaine: where did you go? \\n\\njerry: the store. \\n\\nelaine: mm! to get what? \\n\\njerry: stuff. \\n\\nelaine: cleaning supplies? \\n\\njerry: and gum. \\n\\nelaine: oh. well, there\\'s nothin\\' more sophisticated than diddlin\\' the maid and then chewin\\' some gum. \\n\\njerry: she\\'s not a maid. she might be a news woman! \\n\\nkramer: hey. well, i just saw madeline off. yeah. she\\'s in a cab and--nguh nguh nguh--on her way. i miss her already. \\n\\nelaine: hey, kramer, what was it you were having faxed to my house every 30 seconds? \\n\\nkramer: well, i signed up for a food delivery service, now we\\'re cookin\\'. that\\'s a play on words. you know, they\\'re faxing me the menus from some restaurants. \\n\\nelaine: which ones? \\n\\nkramer: well, all of them. it\\'s the deluxe package. \\n\\nelaine: so this is never gonna stop? \\n\\nkramer: well, it better not. paid for the whole year. so, should i pick those up later? \\n\\nelaine: you can pick \\'em up right now. \\n\\nkramer: ah! \\n\\nelaine (thinking): i wonder if anyone knows he\\'s here. if he just disappeared...would anybody notice? \\n\\nphone man: all right, miss benes, all finished. here\\'s your new number. \\n\\nelaine: ahem. 646? what is this? \\n\\nphone man: that\\'s your new area code. \\n\\nelaine: i thought 646 was just for new numbers. \\n\\nphone man: this is a new number. \\n\\nelaine: no, no, no, no. it\\'s not a new number. it\\'s--it\\'s--it\\'s just a changed number. see? it\\'s not different. it\\'s the same, just...changed. \\n\\nphone man: look, i work for the phone company. i\\'ve had a lot of experience with semantics, so don\\'t try to lure me into some maze of circular logic. \\n\\nelaine: you know, i could\\'ve killed you, and no one would\\'ve known. \\n\\nphone man: i could\\'ve killed you, and no one would\\'ve known. \\n\\njerry: kramer, you\\'re still on the phone? \\n\\nkramer: madeline and i are watching quincy together. jerry, you know this comes on at the same time here as it does there? \\n\\njerry: really? it\\'s tuesday here. what day is it there? \\n\\nkramer (into phone): jerry\\'s teasing. uh-oh! commercial. oh, you going to the bathroom?

\\n\\ngeorge: \\'cause neil watkins from accounting is t-bone! \\n\\nkramer: oh, yeah i\\'m back. hey, you wanna play cards over the phone? \\n\\nkramer: oh, hey, uh, listen, jerry, uh, laundry\\'s pilin\\' up there. you might want to tell your girlfriend. mmm. yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: your girlfriend is doin\\' your laundry?

\\n\\nelaine: it\\'s a new area code. \\n\\nman: what area? new jersey? \\n\\nelaine: no, no. it\\'s right here in the city. it\\'s the same as 212. they just multiplied it by 3, and then they added one to the middle number. it\\'s the same. \\n\\nman: do i have to dial a one first? \\n\\nman: i\\'m really kinda seein\\' somebody. \\n\\nelaine: yeah? well, so am i! \\n\\ngeorge: excuse me. can i talk to you for a second there, watkins? \\n\\nwatkins: it\\'s t-bone. \\n\\ngeorge: the thing is...i\\'m supposed to be t-bone. \\n\\nwatkins: heh heh. you\\'re not a t-bone. you\\'re a perfect george. \\n\\ngeorge: what? now, you listen to me! \\n\\nkruger: hey, look at george. he\\'s givin\\' it to t-bone. he\\'s jumpin\\' up and down like some kind of monkey. hey, what was the name of that monkey that could read sign language? \\n\\nwatkins: all right, you can have t-bone. stop crying. \\n\\ngeorge (sniffling): i\\'m not crying. and i shouldn\\'t have said that about your wife. please accept my apologies. \\n\\ngeorge: ok, everybody, uh...i have an announcement to make. from now on, i will be known as- \\n\\nkruger: koko the monkey. \\n\\ngeorge: what?

\\n\\njerry: what did i just pay for? \\n\\nkramer: uh-oh. you\\'re a john. \\n\\njerry: koko? \\n\\ngeorge: koko. \\n\\njerry: well, it\\'s probably the most intelligent ape there is. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. so, how\\'s cindy the maid? \\n\\njerry: well, everything\\'s goin\\' great except, basically, i\\'m payin\\' for sex. \\n\\ngeorge: tell me about it. i went out with this girl last week. first i had to pay for dinner, then-- \\n\\njerry: no, george. she\\'s coming over and not cleaning. it\\'s like i\\'m seein\\' a prostitute. \\n\\ngeorge: how much you pay this maid? \\n\\njerry: 40. \\n\\ngeorge: 40? i\\'m payin\\' 60 to my maid. she doesn\\'t do laundry and i\\'m gettin\\' nothin\\'. all right. once she pinched my ass, but i don\\'t know what that was. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know what this is. \\n\\nkramer: hey, hey, hey. look at that. \\n\\njerry: ooh. \\n\\nkramer: jerry, you wouldn\\'t believe what it\\'s like down there. taxicab drivers are insane. you know, everybody is in a hurry. \\n\\ngeorge: i can\\'t eat with you leanin\\' over like this. just look straight forward. \\n\\nkramer: well, now i can\\'t see jerry. \\n\\njerry: i look about the same. \\n\\ngeorge: what? \\n\\njerry: i was talking to him. \\n\\nkramer: what? \\n\\njerry: never mind. \\n\\nkramer: come on. what\\'d he say? \\n\\ngeorge: never mind. \\n\\nkramer: jerry, come on. what\\'d you say? \\n\\njerry: what?

coco? \\n\\ncindy: yeah. coco. that girl\\'s all right. \\n\\ngeorge: you know, if i could get this coco woman down to kruger, they wouldn\\'t be able to call me koko anymore because kruger would never allow 2 kokos. \\n\\njerry: sounds like he runs a real tight ship. \\n\\ngeorge: say good-bye to koko. \\n\\njerry: good-bye, koko. \\n\\nkramer: bye, koko. whew! jerry, this relationship is killing me. the distance, the longing, the distance, the-- you know, i didn\\'t realize it, but i\\'m a needy person. \\n\\njerry: kramer, maybe this relationship isn\\'t for you. \\n\\nkramer: oh, yeah? so what am i supposed to do, be more like you? all sealed up in here, emotionally unavailable, paying scrubwomen for sexual favors! no! jerry, i won\\'t be like you! never! i\\'ll never be like you! \\n\\ncindy: what was that? \\n\\njerry: i didn\\'t hear anything. \\n\\ncindy: all right, i\\'m takin\\' off. aren\\'t you forgetting something? \\n\\njerry: oh, right! hey, it was great seeing you again. i love your outfit. \\n\\ncindy: no. my money. \\n\\njerry: for what? \\n\\ncindy: for my maid services. you booked me for today. \\n\\njerry: but you didn\\'t really do any work. \\n\\ncindy: i made the bed. \\n\\njerry: but you took a nap in it. \\n\\ncindy: so? \\n\\njerry: i thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making. \\n\\ncindy: no. that was the maid. \\n\\njerry: well, who took the nap? \\n\\ncindy: the girlfriend. \\n\\njerry: $40 seems kind of steep for a nap. \\n\\ncindy: so, what are you saying? that i\\'m a bad maid or some kind of a prostitute? \\n\\njerry: ho, ho...ho! hold on. let\\'s keep this sophisticated. \\n\\ncindy: you know, i don\\'t think i want to be your girlfriend or your maid. \\n\\njerry: so is this a breakup/quitting? \\n\\ncindy: yeah. don\\'t ever call me or hire me again. \\n\\njerry: oh, yeah? well, then, we\\'re through! and you\\'re fired! \\n\\nphone man: sign here. \\n\\nelaine: yes! 212. \\n\\nelaine: hey, what happened to the guy i had last time?

\\n\\nelaine: oh...nuts. \\n\\nboy: do you hate me \\'cause of my lazy eye? \\n\\nelaine: no. it\\'s just that i\\'ve been kind of buried over here. \\n\\njerry: so the kid doesn\\'t know his grandmother is dead? g-5? \\n\\nelaine: hit. no. i guess his parents didn\\'t want to tell him. b-2? \\n\\njerry: miss. \\n\\nelaine: he called 6 times yesterday. what a nightmare it must be to have a real family. \\n\\njerry: i wouldn\\'t worry about it. b-6?

\\n\\nkramer: i think it\\'s over. we had a big fight, she threw me out, i started walkin\\', and now i\\'m lost downtown! i don\\'t have any money. i don\\'t recognize anybody. i miss home, and i don\\'t even know how to get there. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s around you? \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m lookin\\' at ray\\'s pizza. you know where that is? \\n\\njerry: is it famous ray\\'s? \\n\\nkramer: no. it\\'s original ray\\'s. \\n\\njerry: famous original ray\\'s? \\n\\nkramer: it\\'s just original, jerry! \\n\\njerry: well, what street are you on? \\n\\nkramer: hey, i\\'m on first and first. how can the same street intersect with itself? i must be at the nexus of the universe. \\n\\njerry: just wait there. i\\'ll pick you up, and, kramer, stay alive no matter what occurs, i will find you! \\n\\nkramer: aah! \\n\\nman: you steinfeld?

she told me what you like. you\\'re a little sickie, aren\\'t you? disinfectant on the blinds, vacuuming the counter-- \\n\\njerry: hey, come on. come on. i gotta live around here. \\n\\nman: you know what i do to people who stiff me on a job? \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nman: well, it kinda depends on the situation, but if i don\\'t get my money from you, i\\'m gonna get it from her. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t want to make trouble. you want the money? here. \\n\\nman: hey! wait, wait, wait! whoa! give it to the girl. i\\'m an independent contractor. tax purposes. \\n\\nelaine: bobby, you gotta stop calling your gammy. why? because sometimes you call very early in the morning when gammy has been out late the night before and sometimes when gammy\\'s not alone. your parents still haven\\'t said anything to you about your gammy? (sighs) all right, here we go. (coughing) gammy doesn\\'t feel so good. i think gammy might be dying. yep. yep. ok. good-bye, bobby. don\\'t call anymore. i\\'m dead now. gotta go. \\n\\nbobby: 9-1-1. \\n\\njerry: nexus of the universe. hey, cindy. cindy. \\n\\ncindy: what do you want?

\\n\\ngeorge: because ballpark food doesn\\'t count as real food. \\n\\njerry: right. it\\'s just an activity. it\\'s like that paddle with the ball and the rubber band. \\n\\nkramer: you know, my friend bob saccamano made a fortune off of those. see he came up with the idea for the rubber band. before that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away. \\n\\njerry: i can\\'t believe you all made me leave before the end of the game. \\n\\nelaine: oh, come on, jerry. it was 9 to nothing. we were getting shellacked. \\n\\ngeorge: those nachos are killing me. \\n\\nelaine: i thought you were hungry. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s complicated. \\n\\nkramer: come on, jerry, you\\'re going to miss the exit. \\n\\njerry: keep your shirt on. i got it. \\n\\nelaine: watch out for that maroon golf. \\n\\nkramer: oh, boy. \\n\\njerry: look at this guy. he\\'s trying to box me out. \\n\\nkramer: i\\'ll tell you when you can go. wait, wait, wait, wait-- now, now, now. no, no, no. go, go! no, no. wait-- now, now! now! jerry! go--ahh... \\n\\njerry: oh, calm down, maroon golf. he thinks i cut him off. he accelerated. \\n\\nkramer: you want me to moon him? ooh, let\\'s moon him. roll up your window. let\\'s do a pressed ham under glass. \\n\\nelaine: oh, no, i couldn\\'t do that. \\n\\nkramer: look at this, look at this. he\\'s giving us the finger. \\n\\nelaine: oh, all right. \\n\\nkramer: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: so i saw that new movie about the hindenburg. \\n\\nelaine: oh, yeah. what\\'s that called? \\n\\ngeorge: blimp the hindenburg story. \\n\\njerry: how was it? \\n\\ngeorge: i found it morose. why dwell on these negative themes? \\n\\njerry: yeah. they should make a movie about all the hindenburg flights that made it. \\n\\ngeorge: anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles over the airfield, i yelled out, \"that\\'s gotta hurt!\" \\n\\njerry: heh. \\n\\ngeorge: the place went nuts. \\n\\njerry: imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you\\'d yelled that out at the actual disaster. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. \\n\\nkramer: why are we slowing down? \\n\\njerry: what is that music? \\n\\ngeorge: what\\'s with all these flags? \\n\\njerry: oh, no. \\n\\nelaine and jerry: it\\'s the puerto rican day parade! \\n\\nelaine: ohh! oh, the city shuts down fifth avenue. they never let anyone through. we\\'re never getting home. \\n\\nkramer: all right. i\\'m gonna check it out. aiee. mucho trafico. \\n\\n[stock footage: puerto rican day parade.] \\n\\nkramer: yeah...uhh...well, the streets are all blocked. i think every puerto rican in the world is out here. \\n\\npuerto rican man: well, it is our day. \\n\\nkramer: whoo. wrong car. sorry. \\n\\nradio: and the mets score two in the eighth inning. \\n\\njerry: see? if we had stayed, we could have seen those runs. \\n\\ngeorge: i could have had some ice cream. i think that might have calmed down the nachos. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m going to miss 60 minutes. you know, i hate to miss 60 minutes. it\\'s part of my sunday weekend wind-down. \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. it makes me anxious. \\n\\nkramer: all right, gentlemen, i scouted it out. i think we can get out over there. \\n\\njerry: but that\\'s a one-way street coming this way. besides, how am i gonna get all the way over there? \\n\\ngeorge: just inch over. you worm your way. \\n\\nelaine: just do it, jerry. uhh. this exhaust. i\\'m gonna throw up. \\n\\nkramer: you know, you should make yourself throw up. \\n\\nelaine: huh?

\\n\\nkramer: no, no, no. it was mara conchita alonso. \\n\\ngeorge: this guy\\'s giving me the stare-ahead. \\n\\njerry: the stare-ahead. i hate that. i use it all the time. \\n\\ngeorge: look at me! i am man! i am you! \\n\\ngeorge: all right, he\\'s letting you in. thank you! creep. \\n\\nkramer: oh! i know who it is. stacy keach. \\n\\njerry: one more lane to go. \\n\\ngeorge: all right! we\\'re here! \\n\\nlamar: oh, look who\\'s here. my old buddy, black saab. \\n\\njerry: maroon golf. \\n\\nlamar: where you goin\\', black saab?

\\n\\nelaine (yelling): hey! fold your dog\\'s ear back! \\n\\nelaine: ooh! this isn\\'t moving! i could walk faster than this. \\n\\ncab driver: no, you can\\'t. \\n\\nelaine: yes, i can. here. i\\'m outta here. \\n\\nelaine: oh, now it\\'s moving. oh, yeah. i knew it. hey! hey! \\n\\ncab driver: where to?

\\n\\nlady 2: oh, i think someone has one of those funny laser pointers. \\n\\nlaser guy: gimme a box of those and one of those. \\n\\ngeorge: excuse me, are you the guy with that funny laser? \\n\\nlaser guy: the laser\\'s not funny. i\\'m funny. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. the thing is, i, uh...i had this little zinger of my own i wanted to try. \\n\\nlaser guy: uh-huh. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s right in the explosion scene. so if you could just...leave me a little window. you know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed with a laser. all right, i don\\'t want to interrupt your meal, so... \\n\\njerry: i\\'ve gotta see this game. if it wasn\\'t for this guy, we could get out of here. \\n\\nlamar: this traffic\\'s a killer, ain\\'t it? \\n\\nkramer: you want to get outta here? here\\'s what we do. we leave the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number off the engine block, and we walk away. \\n\\njerry: walk away? \\n\\nkramer: you\\'ve got insurance. you tell them that the car was stolen, and then you get another one free. \\n\\njerry: isn\\'t there a deductible? \\n\\nkramer: all right, what is your deductible? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know. \\n\\nkramer: yes, because they\\'ve already deducted it. \\n\\njerry: from what? \\n\\nkramer: the car, which we\\'re leaving. so the net is zero. see you pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car. \\n\\njerry: we\\'re not leaving the car! \\n\\nkramer: all right. if you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance company, you\\'ll have to work this out with maroon golf. \\n\\njerry: absolutely not. he sped up. \\n\\nradio: swung on, line hard toward left center field. that\\'s in the gap, that\\'s a base hit. \\n\\njerry: i\\'m ready to talk. \\n\\nlady 1: hey! there\\'s that laser guy again. \\n\\nlady 2: he\\'s funny. i never meet anyone funny. \\n\\nlady 1: i know. a sense of humor is so much more important to me than looks or hair. \\n\\nlady 2: mmm, yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s gotta hurt! \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s...gotta hurt! hurt! because...aaarrrrrgh! \\n\\ngeorge: damn you, laser guy! you had to grab it all with your lowbrow laser shtick! you\\'re just a prop comic! where\\'s the craft?! \\n\\nlady 1: look! it\\'s on the bald guy. \\n\\nlady 2: i am so glad we came to this showing. \\n\\nkramer: ok, here\\'s the deal. he wants you to acknowledge that you cut him off with an \"i am sorry\" wave. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s that? \\n\\nkramer: you raise the hand, lower the head-- \"i\\'m sorry, i\\'m sorry. the buttons are really big on the car. i don\\'t understand it. i haven\\'t read the manual. ooh!\" you get my drift. \\n\\njerry: ok! \\n\\nlamar: hallelujah. praise the lord. but i\\'ll take it. \\n\\nkramer: yes! all right, lamar, back it up a little bit so we can get out now. \\n\\ngeorge: all right. at last, we\\'re finally gettin\\' out of here. \\n\\njerry: what\\'s that on your forehead? \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s probably chocolate. \\n\\njerry: hey, is that one of those laser pointers? \\n\\nkramer: hey, jerry, crank up the floyd. it\\'s a george laserium! \\n\\ngeorge: all right, stop it! stay away from my breasts! chest! \\n\\njerry: see ya around maroon golf. and, by the way, that was an \"i\\'m not sorry\" wave. \\n\\nlamar: what was that? \\n\\njerry: i\\'m glad i cut you off, because black saab rules! so long, jackass! \\n\\njerry: elaine?! \\n\\nelaine: jerry?! \\n\\nlamar: jackass? so i\\'m a jackass now? \\n\\njerry: so if everyone would just put their cars in reverse at the same time, we can do this. all right, on the count of three. can everyone hear me? hey, amigo, are you paying attention? \\n\\npuerto rican man: buenos dias, my friend. \\n\\njerry: not you! the guy in the amigo. \\n\\nelaine: uh, well, uh, here--here is good. \\n\\ntaxi driver: oh, yeah, sure, and now i\\'m gonna be stuck here. but you knew the way to go! you went to college! \\n\\nelaine: hey, i went to tufts! that was my safety school! so don\\'t talk to me about hardship. \\n\\nelaine: boy, eh, can you believe this mess? \\n\\njerry: elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?! we were almost out! \\n\\nlamar: so that was your girlfriend that blocked you in. that\\'s real good. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m not his girlfriend. well, actually, we used to date, but not anymore. \\n\\njerry: elaine, he doesn\\'t need- \\n\\nlamar: used to date? so i guess you found out he\\'s a jackass. \\n\\njerry: \\'cause that\\'s what\\'s gonna happen. \\n\\nkramer: wow. he\\'s givin\\' you a mustache. where is this guy? \\n\\ngeorge: don\\'t look around. don\\'t look around. that\\'s what he wants. \\n\\nelaine: all right. well, i\\'ll see ya. hey, george, i think there\\'s a sniper lookin\\' to pop ya. \\n\\ngeorge: this thing can\\'t hurt me, can it? i mean, it is a laser. what if it hits my eye? \\n\\njerry: i don\\'t know. \\n\\ngeorge: i can\\'t be blind, jerry the blind are courageous. \\n\\nkramer: you\\'ll be fine as long as it doesn\\'t hit you right in the pupil, \\'cause then the whole ball will go up like the death star. tchoo! i gotta go find a bathroom. \\n\\njerry: hold it, george. don\\'t move. it\\'s right between your eyes. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, my god. \\n\\njerry: hey, there\\'s the soda guy. \\n\\nlamar: hey, jackass! get me a diet dr. pepper! \\n\\njerry (exasperated): all right! \\n\\nolder man: hey, hey, hey! \\n\\nolder woman: wha--ow! \\n\\nelaine: oh, this is nuts! i can\\'t get across anywhere! \\n\\nolder man: well, none of us can! we\\'re trapped! \\n\\nolder woman: ow! \\n\\nelaine: hey! hey, everyone. this way. i think we can get out through here. \\n\\nolder man: oh, i don\\'t know if that\\'s such a good idea. \\n\\nelaine: look! no one knows how long this parade is gonna last! they are a very festive people. all i know is that it\\'s sunday night, and i have got to unwind! now who\\'s with me?! \\n\\nolder woman: father?

\\n\\ngeorge: the side? \\n\\njerry: yeah. wouldn\\'t it just bounce back and forth between your cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more intense, until finally- \\n\\ngeorge: all right! \\n\\njerry: oh. it\\'s in your eye now. \\n\\nkramer: hola, jerry! i\\'m into this puerto rican day! the sights! the sounds! the hot, spicy flavor of it all! it\\'s caliente, jerry! \\n\\njerry: kramer, the mets have got men on base! \\n\\nkramer: yeah, i know! i was watchin\\' the game. \\n\\njerry: you were watchin\\'?

\\n\\nkramer: ooh! !dios mio! \\n\\nman: hey! there\\'s a guy burning the puerto rican flag! \\n\\nbob: who! who is burning the flag?! \\n\\nkramer: oh, no. \\n\\nbob: him?! \\n\\ncedric: that\\'s not very nice. \\n\\nkramer: it was an accident. \\n\\nbob: do you know what day this is? because i know what day this is, they know what day this is, so i was wondering if you know what day this is! \\n\\ncedric: because it\\'s puerto rican day. \\n\\nbob: maybe we should stomp you like you stomp the flag! what do you think of that? \\n\\nkramer: now look, i just have one thing to say to you boys. mama! \\n\\nsales woman: right this way, mr. vandelay. \\n\\ngeorge: well, this is a lovely apartment. lovely! my kids are gonna go crazy. i, uh, i wonder if i could see the bathrooms. preferably one with some paint thinner and, uh, some rags? \\n\\nsales woman: it\\'s down the hall. \\n\\njerry: oh, hello... \\n\\ngeorge: art. \\n\\njerry: mr. vandelay, of course. \\n\\nsales woman: you two know each other? \\n\\nsales woman: mr. pennypacker! \\n\\nkramer: uh, yes, uh, i--i wanted to, uh, stop by and make sure that my shark tank fits-- uh, hello. \\n\\nsales woman: mr. pennypacker, this is mr. vandelay, and you know mr. varnsen \\n\\nkramer: uh, varnsen. \\n\\njerry: pennypacker. \\n\\nkramer: vandelay. \\n\\ngeorge: pennypacker. varnsen. \\n\\njerry: vandelay. wait a second. mr. pennypacker, if you\\'re here, and mr. vandelay is also here, then who\\'s watching the factory?

would that be a terrible thing? \"how\\'s everything? do you need anything? what can i do for you?\" \\n\\njerry: i know what you mean. \\n\\ngeorge: do ya? \\n\\njerry: it\\'s like going out with someone and you never hear from them again. \\n\\ngeorge: same thing! \\n\\njerry: not really, but it\\'s something. ask the people behind you. \\n\\ngeorge: excuse me. are you using your catsup? \\n\\nwoman: what do you think? you want to give him the catsup? \\n\\nman: it\\'s up to you. \\n\\nwoman: you know what? i don\\'t think so. i\\'m going to need it from time to time. \\n\\njerry: so what are you doing later? you want to go to the movies? \\n\\ngeorge: nah - what for? \\n\\njerry: to see a movie. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'ve been to the movies. \\n\\njerry: not this movie. \\n\\ngeorge: they\\'re all the same. you go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. i\\'m sick of it. \\n\\njerry: did you shower today? \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s usually the kind of mood i\\'m in when i haven\\'t showered. \\n\\ngeorge: when is it going to be my turn, jerry? when do i get my 15 minutes? i want my 15 minutes! \\n\\njerry: oh, quit complaining. at least you have your health. \\n\\ngeorge: ah! health\\'s not good enough. i want more than health. health\\'s not doing it for me anymore. i\\'m sick of health. \\n\\nwoman: all right, we\\'re done. you can have it now. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, very gracious. \\n\\nman: nice day \\n\\ngeorge: yeah. \\n\\njerry: what is that? \\n\\nkramer: hey! jojo! \\n\\njerry: ey, ey! \\n\\nelaine: all right, thanks for the ride, kramer. \\n\\nkramer: no, thank you. so what are you doing? \\n\\njerry: nothing. \\n\\nkramer: come on, let\\'s go to the beach. \\n\\ngeorge: what are you crazy? \\n\\nkramer: what? it\\'s a beautiful day. \\n\\njerry: have a good time. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, there\\'s something in the air today. you feel it? there\\'s something in the air. \\n\\njerry: you know you\\'re turning into burt lancaster?

i\\'m going to call you back. \\n\\njerry: jill\\'s father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone? \\n\\nelaine: what? no good? \\n\\njerry: faux pas. \\n\\nelaine: faux pas? \\n\\ngeorge: big hefty stinking faux pas. \\n\\nelaine: why? \\n\\njerry: you can\\'t make a health inquiry on a cell phone. it\\'s like saying \"i don\\'t want to take up any of my important time in my home so i\\'ll just get it out of the way on the street.\" \\n\\ngeorge: on-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s an act of total disregard. it\\'s selfish. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s dismissive. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s pompous. \\n\\ngeorge: why don\\'t you think before you do something? \\n\\nelaine: here\\'s a thought - bye bye. \\n\\ngeorge: too much? \\n\\ngeorge: boy - i\\'m really surprised at elaine - that whole phone business - she should know better than that. \\n\\njerry: hey - hey - hey! \\n\\ngeorge: what? \\n\\njerry: where do you think this relationship is? if you are thinking of instituting an open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend. \\n\\ngeorge: you\\'re so uptight. \\n\\njerry: uptight? let\\'s all just have a big pee party. hey everybody, grab a bucket. we\\'re going up to jerry\\'s. it\\'s a pee party. \\n\\nphone tape: jerry, this is elizabeth clark calling from james kimbrough\\'s office at nbc. could you please give us a call?thanks. \\n\\njerry: hello. yeah, hi, this is jerry seinfeld calling for james kimbrough. hello?

\\n\\njerry: right. \\n\\ngeorge: \"jerry\", oh my god. he wants to talk about \"jerry\"? \\n\\njerry: yeah! \\n\\ngeorge: when? \\n\\njerry: today, like right now. \\n\\ngeorge: right now? \"jerry\"? \\n\\njerry: \"jerry\"! \\n\\ngeorge: he wants to talk about \"jerry\"? \\n\\njerry: he wants to talk about \"jerry\"! \\n\\ngeorge: \"jerry\"! \\n\\njerry: \"jerry\"! \\n\\ngeorge: can i go like this? \\n\\njerry: sure! \\n\\ngeorge: no sports jacket? i don\\'t need a sports jacket? writers wear sports jackets. \\n\\njerry: forget the sports jacket. \\n\\ngeorge: i won\\'t feel like a writer. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re not a writer. \\n\\ngeorge: right! \\n\\ngeorge: water. need some water! water here! \\n\\njerry: ok, now listen, i don\\'t want any scenes in here like the last time. \\n\\ngeorge: don\\'t worry, don\\'t worry, no scenes. \\n\\njerry: don\\'t blow this. \\n\\ngeorge: i will not blow this. \\n\\njerry: if he says he doesn\\'t want it to be a show about nothing, don\\'t go nuts. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s fine, it doesn\\'t have to be about nothing. \\n\\njerry: he might not want nothing. \\n\\ngeorge: something, nothing, i could care less. \\n\\njerry: he might want a show about anything and everything. \\n\\ngeorge: anything, everything, something, nothing - who the hell cares? put me down. i\\'m down! \\n\\njerry: all right. \\n\\nreceptionist: mr. kimbrough is ready to see you \\n\\ngeorge: magic time. \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\ngeorge: nothing \\n\\nreceptionist: mr. kimbrough. \\n\\nstu: hey, jerry, good to see you. \\n\\ngeorge: hey, hey, hey! \\n\\nstu: how you been? \\n\\njerry: good, good. you remember george. \\n\\nstu: george, good to see you. \\n\\ngeorge: hello stu. \\n\\nstu: you remember jay crespi. \\n\\ngeorge: jay crespi, how am i gonna forget jay crespi? \\n\\nstu: this is james kimbrough. \\n\\nkimbrough: nice to meet you, pleasure, thanks for coming in. \\n\\ngeorge: kimbrough. \\n\\njerry: don\\'t spell. \\n\\ngeorge: k-i-m-b-r-o-u-g-h \\n\\nkimbrough: that\\'s right. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s a talent i have. \\n\\nkimbrough: why don\\'t we sit down, glad you\\'re here. \\n\\ngeorge: woo! some day out there - you ever see weather like that? woo! it\\'s crisp - it\\'s crispy crisp. \\n\\njerry: shut up, george. \\n\\nkimbrough: can i get you anything? \\n\\ngeorge: what do we have in the fruit department? \\n\\njerry: oy. \\n\\nstu: pineapple. \\n\\ngeorge: oh, that\\'s a dangerous fruit. it\\'s like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the end. you can get killed from one of those things. \\n\\nkimbrough: anyway, let me tell you why i called. when i took over here last month, i reviewed what was in development,and it was pretty much same old, same old. \\n\\ngeorge: been there, done that. \\n\\nkimbrough: right. i was looking for something different. something that would have people talking at the water coolers. \\n\\ngeorge: water coolers? \\n\\ncrespi: we call it a water-cooler show. \\n\\njerry: because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right? \\n\\ngeorge: see, i think people would talk about it at the coffee machines. \\n\\njerry: well it\\'s probably just easier to say \"water cooler show\" than \"coffee machine show.\" \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s really not accurate. nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use bottles. \\n\\njerry: but i think mr. kimbrough makes a good point. \\n\\nkimbrough: anyway, stu here started telling me about a show, \"jerry\", that he developed five years ago. \\n\\nstu: i have always loved it. \\n\\nkimbrough: he said it was a show about nothing. so, i saw the pilot and i\\'ve got to tell you - i flipped out. \\n\\ncrespi: he totally flipped out. \\n\\nkimbrough: what i want to do is put it on the air. 13-episode commitment. start it off on wednesday night, build up an audience. this show needs time to grow. i love that kramer guy. \\n\\njerry: he\\'s a little off the wall. \\n\\ncrespi: oh yeah. \\n\\nstu: kramer. \\n\\nkimbrough: and elaine - i wouldn\\'t mind seeing something happening between you two. \\n\\njerry: definitely. \\n\\ngeorge: i tell you, i really don\\'t think so-called relationship humor is what this show is all about. \\n\\nkimbrough: or we could not do the show altogether, how about that? \\n\\ngeorge: or we could get them together. woo! \\n\\ngeorge: yeah! \\n\\njerry: yeah! \\n\\nelaine: jill, hi, it\\'s elaine. well, i\\'m calling from my home. indoors. well, i was just calling to see how your fa.. i\\'m sorry, i\\'m getting another call. hang on just a second. hello? \\n\\njerry: hi. elaine, it\\'s me. \\n\\nelaine: jerry, i\\'m on the other line. \\n\\njerry: no no - this is an emergency - get off the phone. \\n\\nelaine: i\\'m sorry, jill. i\\'m going to have to take this call. jerry, what\\'s the emergency? \\n\\njerry: the \"jerry\"\\'s back on - the tv show! george and i are moving to california! \\n\\nelaine: that\\'s the emergency? \\n\\njerry: did you hear what i said? \\n\\nelaine: i was on the other line talking to jill. \\n\\njerry: jill? well, why didn\\'t you say so? \\n\\nelaine: you said it was an emergency. \\n\\njerry: so now she\\'s lost a phone face-off? that\\'s even worse than your cell phone walk-and-talk. \\n\\nhelen: congratulations, they\\'re doing the show. \\n\\nmorty: they should have put that show on 5 years ago. bunch of idiots at that network. can i tell you something, jerry? it\\'s all crap on tv. the only thing i watch is xena the warrior princess. she must be about six-six. \\n\\nhelen: she\\'s not six-six. \\n\\nmorty: jerry, you ever watch that? \\n\\njerry: yeah, it\\'s pretty good. \\n\\nestelle: they picked up the show? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m moving to california. \\n\\nfrank: oh baby-doll, this kid\\'s going places, i told you. \\n\\nestelle: the nbc guy liked it? \\n\\ngeorge: of course he liked it. \\n\\nestelle: he told you he liked it? \\n\\ngeorge: he wouldn\\'t put it on if he didn\\'t like it. \\n\\nestelle: well, what are you doing? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m writing. \\n\\nestelle: you know how to write? \\n\\nfrank: without the writing, you have nothing. you\\'re the ones that make them look good. \\n\\nestelle: since when do you know how to write? i never saw you write anything. \\n\\ngeorge: ma?! \\n\\nestelle: i don\\'t know how you\\'re going to write all those shows. and where are you get all the ideas? \\n\\nfrank: would you leave him alone? you\\'ll shatter his confidence! \\n\\ngeorge: i don\\'t need any ideas. it\\'s a show about nothing. \\n\\nestelle: nothing. please. i\\'ll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty stupid to me. \\n\\njerry: nbc is letting me use their private jet? and i can go anywhere i want? that\\'s fantastic! thanks. great. okay, bye. \\n\\nkramer: oh hey! \\n\\njerry: hey - how was the beach? \\n\\nkramer: oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas \\n\\njerry: i had a little meeting today at nbc. what are you doing? \\n\\nkramer: you know, i went swimming and i can\\'t get this water out of my ear. \\n\\njerry: so do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, \"jerry\"? well, the new guy at nbc wants to do it. they\\'re putting it on the air! they\\'re giving us a 13-episode commitment. george and i are moving to california! \\n\\nkramer: you\\'re moving to california? \\n\\njerry: yeah, only for a while. \\n\\nkramer: yeah, but jerry, what happens if the show\\'s a hit? you could be out there for years! you might never come back. \\n\\njerry: no, i\\'ll be back. \\n\\nkramer: jerry. it\\'s l.a. nobody leaves. she\\'s a seductress, she\\'s a siren, she\\'s a virgin, she\\'s a whore. \\n\\njerry: and my agent said as a bonus, i can use their private jet, so we\\'ll all go somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before george and i go to california. \\n\\nkramer: fling! \\n\\nelaine: so we can go anywhere we want? \\n\\njerry: anywhere. \\n\\nelaine: why are they doing this? \\n\\njerry: i think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their shelf for five years. \\n\\nelaine: this is all very exciting. \\n\\ngeorge: so? where are we going? \\n\\nkramer: i say japan. \\n\\nelaine: why japan? \\n\\nkramer: oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. they\\'re shy at first, but they\\'re quite skilled at conversation. they can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine art of fishing - or baking. \\n\\nelaine: oh - i got it - how about russia? \\n\\njerry: russia, it\\'s so bleak. \\n\\nelaine: it\\'s not bleak - it\\'s springtime. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s still bleak. \\n\\nelaine: you can\\'t be bleak in spring. \\n\\njerry: you can be bleak in spring. \\n\\ngeorge: if you\\'re bleak, you\\'re bleak. \\n\\nelaine: what about switzerland? \\n\\nkramer: oh - switzerland - the von trapp family, huh? \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s a bit hilly - no? \\n\\nelaine: you\\'re not going to do any walking. \\n\\ngeorge: what if i want to walk around a little? \\n\\nelaine: so then you\\'ll walk down the hill and we\\'ll pick you up. \\n\\ngeorge: what if i\\'m at the bottom? \\n\\nelaine: all right! you know what, just forget it! \\n\\njerry: alright - come on - come on now, people. let\\'s face it, we\\'re not all going to agree on anything. why don\\'t we all just go to paris? \\n\\nelaine: i\\'ll go to paris. \\n\\ngeorge: me too. \\n\\nkramer: oh yeah - oui oui. \\n\\njerry: so that\\'s it - it\\'s settled, we\\'re going to paris. \\n\\ngroup: yeah! \\n\\nelaine: hey. nbc limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {nbc tune} i\\'m just going to call jill one more time before we go. \\n\\njerry: wait, you can\\'t make a call like that on your way out. you can\\'t rush that conversation. \\n\\nelaine: well, i can\\'t call from the limo. can i call from the plane? \\n\\njerry: first you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting face-off, now you\\'re talking about a plane call? \\n\\nelaine: all right, i\\'ll just have to call her from paris. \\n\\nnewman: hello, jerry. \\n\\njerry: hello, newman. what gives? \\n\\nnewman: i was speaking earlier with kramer and he mentioned something about a private jet to paris? \\n\\njerry: yeah, that\\'s right. \\n\\nnewman: well, i hear it\\'s quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you know i\\'m one-quarter french. \\n\\njerry: really. \\n\\nnewman: oh yes, in fact i still have family there. this probably won\\'t interest you, but i have a cousin there who\\'s suffering very badly. she\\'s lost all use of her muscles. she can only communicate by blinking. i would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine into her tragic life. but alas, i can\\'t afford it, for i am, as you know, but a simple postal worker. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s a shame. \\n\\nnewman: take me! take me! \\n\\njerry: oh, forget it. pull yourself together. you\\'re making me sick. be a man! \\n\\nnewman: all right! but hear me and hear me well - the day will come. oh yes, mark my words, seinfeld - your day of reckoning is coming. when an evil wind will blow through your little playworld, and wipe that smug smile off your face. and i\\'ll be there, in all my glory, watching - watching as it all comes crumbling down. \\n\\ncaptain: ah, jerry? \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\ncaptain: i\\'m captain maddox this is my co-pilot, kurt adams. ready to go to paris? \\n\\njerry: all set. we\\'ll just grab the bags. \\n\\ncaptain: don\\'t worry about that. we\\'ll take care of them for you. \\n\\njerry: just keeps on getting better and better. \\n\\njerry: not bad. \\n\\nelaine: wow! \\n\\nkramer: the only way to fly. \\n\\ngeorge: this is it? \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m sorry - i have to say, i\\'m a little disappointed, i thought it would be a lot nicer. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re complaining about a private jet? \\n\\ngeorge: you think this is the plane that ted danson gets? \\n\\njerry: ted danson is not even on the network anymore. \\n\\ngeorge: still, i bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one. \\n\\nelaine: will you shut up? you are ruining the whole trip. \\n\\ngeorge: this is a real piece of junk. i don\\'t even feel safe on this thing. i have a good mind to write a letter tomr. kimbrough. \\n\\njerry: you\\'re not writing any letters! \\n\\nelaine: will you turn around? \\n\\ngeorge: why? \\n\\nelaine: you are annoying me sitting like that. it\\'s effeminate. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s effeminate to sit like this? \\n\\nelaine: yes, i think it\\'s a little effeminate. \\n\\ngeorge: how is this effeminate? \\n\\nelaine: i don\\'t know - it just is. \\n\\ngeorge: kramer, what are you doing? \\n\\njerry: still got water in your ear? \\n\\nkramer: can\\'t get rid of it. maybe it leaked inside my brain. \\n\\ngeorge: would you stop that? it\\'s not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane. \\n\\nkramer: i got to get it out, i can\\'t take this anymore. \\n\\ngeorge: kramer, don\\'t be fooling around up here. \\n\\ngeorge: kramer! \\n\\ncaptain: hey, get the hell out of here! \\n\\nelaine: what is that? \\n\\ngeorge: oh my god! \\n\\nelaine: what is that noise? what is that noise? \\n\\njerry: kramer, what the hell did you do? \\n\\nkramer: i lost my balance. \\n\\nelaine: oh my god! \\n\\nelaine: what\\'s going on? \\n\\njerry: kramer! \\n\\nkramer: it was an accident. \\n\\ngeorge: i told you to stop with the hopping. \\n\\nelaine: oh my god, we\\'re going down. we\\'re going to die! \\n\\ngeorge: just when i was doing great. i told you god wouldn\\'t let me be successful. \\n\\njerry: is this it? is this how it ends? it can\\'t- it can\\'t end like this. \\n\\nkramer: i\\'m ready! i\\'m ready! glory hallelujah! \\n\\ngeorge: jerry? jerry can you hear me? \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: there\\'s something i have to tell you. \\n\\njerry: what? what is it? \\n\\ngeorge: i cheated in the contest. \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\ngeorge: the contest - i cheated. \\n\\njerry: why? \\n\\ngeorge: because i\\'m a cheater! i had to tell you. \\n\\njerry: great - i won. \\n\\nelaine: jerry, i gotta tell you something too. \\n\\njerry: yeah, elaine i got something i want to say to you. \\n\\nelaine: no no - me first. \\n\\njerry: alright. \\n\\nelaine: jerry, i\\'ve always loved ..u.. \\n\\ngeorge: hey - what\\'s going on? \\n\\nkramer: we\\'re straightening out! \\n\\nelaine: we\\'re straightening out? \\n\\njerry: we\\'re straightening out! \\n\\ngeorge: we\\'re straightening out! \\n\\ngroup: yeah! \\n\\ncaptain: well, again, sorry about that little mishap. but once you get everything checked out there shouldn\\'t be anymore problems. \\n\\njerry: where are we? \\n\\ncaptain: latham, massachusetts. why don\\'t you take a cab into town, get yourself something to eat. i got your beeper number - i\\'ll beep you as soon as we\\'re ready. \\n\\njerry: okay. \\n\\nelaine: okay. \\n\\njerry: we\\'ll see you later. \\n\\nelaine: well, what are we going to do about paris? i mean are we actually going to get back on this plane? \\n\\njerry: i say we go back to new york, and take a regular flight. \\n\\ngeorge: i\\'m not getting on a regular plane now - i\\'m all psyched up to go on a private jet. no way i\\'m getting on a regular plane. \\n\\nelaine: well, i\\'m sure that they would fly us first class. \\n\\ngeorge: first class doesn\\'t make it anymore. now you get on the phone with kimbrough, tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the good one - the ted danson plane. \\n\\njerry: alright, i\\'ll feel him out. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, just tell him to hurry it up. \\n\\nstranger: nice day. \\n\\njerry: another one? \\n\\nrobber: alright fatso, out of the car. \\n\\nkramer: i want to capture this. \\n\\nrobber: come on! gimme your wallet. \\n\\nvogel: don\\'t shoot. \\n\\njerry: well, there goes the money for the lipo. \\n\\nelaine: see, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it\\'s an easy getaway. you know? they can\\'t really chase ya! \\n\\ngeorge: he\\'s actually doing him a favor. it\\'s less money for him to buy food. \\n\\nrobber: i want your wallet. come on. come on, come on. \\n\\njerry: that\\'s a shame. alright, i\\'m gonna call nbc. \\n\\nvogel: officer, he\\'s stealing my car! officer, i was carjacked. i was held up at gunpoint! he took my wallet, everything! \\n\\njerry: okay, thanks anyway. they can\\'t get another plane. \\n\\nkramer: all right, what\\'s wrong with the plane we got? they\\'re just checking it out. \\n\\nelaine: forget it. \\n\\njerry: no, no, no. we\\'re not getting on there. come on, let\\'s go get something to eat in sticksville. \\n\\nofficer: all right, hold it right there. \\n\\nkramer: what? \\n\\nofficer: you\\'re under arrest. \\n\\njerry: under arrest? what for? \\n\\nofficer: article 223-7 of the latham county penal code. \\n\\nelaine: what? no, no - we didn\\'t do anything. \\n\\nofficer: that\\'s exactly right. the law requires you to help or assist anyone in danger as long as it\\'s reasonable todo so. \\n\\ngeorge: i never heard of that. \\n\\nofficer: it\\'s new. it\\'s called the good samaritan law. let\\'s go. \\n\\nelaine: the good samaritan law? are they crazy? \\n\\ngeorge: why would we want to help somebody? \\n\\nelaine: i know. \\n\\ngeorge: that\\'s what nuns and red cross workers are for. \\n\\nkramer: the samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people. \\n\\nelaine: alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is. \\n\\ndeputy: well, they just passed it last year. it\\'s modeled after the french law. i heard about it after princess diana was killed and all those photographers were just standing around. \\n\\njerry: oh, yeah. \\n\\nelaine: oh, yeah. \\n\\ndeputy: you\\'re the first ones to be arrested on it, probably in the whole country. \\n\\ngeorge: all right, so what\\'s the penalty here? let\\'s just pay the fine or something and get the hell out of here. \\n\\ndeputy: well, it\\'s not that easy. now see, the law calls for a maximum fine of $85,000 and as much as five years in prison. \\n\\nelaine: what? \\n\\ngeorge: oh no no no no - we have to be in california next week. we\\'re starting a tv show. \\n\\ndeputy: california? oh gosh, i don\\'t think so. yeah, my guess is you\\'re gonna be prosecuted. better get yourselves a good lawyer. \\n\\nchiles: who told you to put the cheese on? did i tell you to put the cheese on? i didn\\'t tell you to put the cheese on. \\n\\nsecretary: jerry seinfeld on the phone. \\n\\nchiles: you people with the cheese. it never ends. hello? uh huh. uh huh. uh huh. good samaritan law? i never heard of it. you don\\'t have to help anybody. that\\'s what this country\\'s all about. that\\'s deplorable, unfathomable, improbable. hold on. suzie, cancel my appointment with dr. bison. and pack a bag for me. i want to get to latham, massachusetts,right away. \\n\\nhoyt: so they got jackie chiles, huh? (sets down the newspaper) uh hmm. you know what that means. this whole place is going to be swarming with media by the time this thing is over. you\\'re not going to be able to find a hotel room in this town. the whole country is going to be watching us. now we got to do whatever it takes to win it, no matter what the cost. the big issue in this trial is going to be character. i want you to find out everything you can about these people - and i mean everything. \\n\\nkramer: mmmm, this is pretty good chow, huh? \\n\\ngeorge: would it kill him to check up on us? no - drops off the meals and that\\'s it. i realize we\\'re prisoners, but we\\'re still entitled to catsup. \\n\\nelaine: i guess we could\\'ve called for help. \\n\\njerry: but then we would have missed the whole thing. \\n\\nkramer: i still had it on video. we could have watched it later. \\n\\ngeorge: yeah, he\\'s right. \\n\\njerry: i forgot about the video. \\n\\nelaine: sure - the video. \\n\\nelaine: what is that? \\n\\njerry: plane\\'s ready. \\n\\nrivera: hi everybody, i\\'m geraldo rivera. tonight we\\'ll be talking about what most of you have probably been discussing in your homes, and around the water coolers in your offices. i am speaking of course of the controversial good samaritan trial that gets underway thursday in latham, massachusetts. now before we meet our distinguished panel, let\\'s go to latham live, where jane wells is standing by. jane- \\n\\nwells: yes. good evening, geraldo. \\n\\nrivera: what\\'s the mood? what\\'s going on tonight? \\n\\nwells: well, latham is fairly quite tonight, considering the media circus that has descended upon this quaint little town. \\n\\nrivera: and what about the defendants - the so-called new york four. how are they holding up? \\n\\nwells: well, i did speak with one of the deputies who had some contact with them, and he told me quote \"there\\'s no love lost with that group.\" \\n\\nrivera: anything else, jane? \\n\\nwells: there also seems to be some friction between mr. seinfeld, and ms. benes. the rumor is that they once dated, and it\\'s possible that ended badly. \\n\\nrivera: well, ladies and gentlemen, who know, maybe this trial will bring them closer together. maybe they\\'ll even end up getting married. \\n\\nhelen: i hope you packed enough - this trial could last for weeks. \\n\\nmorty: what\\'s all that? \\n\\nhelen: cereal. \\n\\nmorty: you\\'re packing cereal? \\n\\nhelen: i\\'m bringing it for jerry. \\n\\nmorty: you got enough here for a life sentence. \\n\\nhelen: he likes it. he says he misses that more that anything. \\n\\nmorty: so bring a snack-pack. \\n\\nestelle: poor georgie, was it our fault this happened to him? did we do something wrong? maybe it was our fault. \\n\\nfrank: maybe it was your fault. it wasn\\'t my fault. i can tell you that. \\n\\nestelle: oh, so it was my fault, but not yours. \\n\\nfrank: you were the one who smothered him. \\n\\nestelle: i did not smother him. \\n\\nfrank: you smothered! he couldn\\'t get any air! he couldn\\'t breathe! he was suffocating! \\n\\nestelle: sure, and you were always in korea with your religious chachkis. \\n\\nfrank: i had to make a living! \\n\\nkramer: this is excellent huh? don\\'t worry i didn\\'t use too much milk, cause i know we gotta make it last. \\n\\njerry: you know i\\'ve had to reduce my milk level. my whole life i\\'ve always filled to at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. now, to conserve, i can\\'t even see the milk anymore. it\\'s a big adjustment. \\n\\nkramer: i bet. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s one of the hardest things i\\'ve ever had to do. \\n\\nchiles: good morning. \\n\\nelaine: good morning, jackie. \\n\\njerry: good morning. \\n\\nchiles: is everybody ready? didn\\'t i tell you i wanted you to wear the cardigan? \\n\\ngeorge: it makes me look older. \\n\\nchiles: look older? do you think this is a game? is that what you think this is? i\\'m trying to give you amoral compass. you have no moral compass. you\\'re going to walk into that courtroom, and the jury\\'s going to see a mean, nasty, evil george costanza. i want them to see perry como. no one\\'s going to convict perry como. perry como helps out a fat tub who\\'s getting robbed. \\n\\nchiles: do you think it\\'s funny? \\n\\njerry: no. \\n\\nchiles: you damn right it isn\\'t. you better not be carrying on laughing in that courtroom, funny man. cause if you start getting all smart-alecky, making wisecracks, acting a fool, you gonna find yourself in here for a long, long time. i don\\'t like that tie. suzie, get one of my ties from my briefcase. \\n\\nelaine: how do i look, jackie? \\n\\nchiles: oh, you looking good. you look strong. you one fine-looking sexy lady. \\n\\nelaine: thank you, jackie. \\n\\nkramer: how bout me, jackie? \\n\\nchiles: kramer, you always look good. you got respect for yourself. you\\'re genuine. jury\\'s going to pick up on that. \\n\\nchiles: here. \\n\\njerry: this one? \\n\\nchiles: that\\'s right. \\n\\njerry: do i have to? \\n\\nelaine: jackie says put it on, jerry. \\n\\nbailiff: all rise. fourth district county court, latham, massachusetts is now in session. the honorable judge arthur vandelay presiding. \\n\\ngeorge: vandelay? the judge\\'s name is vandelay? \\n\\nchiles: vanda who? \\n\\ngeorge: jerry, did you hear that? \\n\\njerry: yeah. \\n\\ngeorge: i think that\\'s a good sign. \\n\\nvandelay: is the district attorney ready to proceed? \\n\\nhoyt: we are, your honor. \\n\\nvandelay: mr. hoyt. \\n\\nhoyt: ladies and gentlemen, last year, our city council by a vote of twelve to two, passed a good samaritan law. now, essentially, we made it a crime to ignore a fellow human being in trouble. now this group from new york not only ignored, but, as we will prove, they actually mocked the victim as he was being robbed at gunpoint. i can guarantee you one other thing, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time they have behaved in this manner. on the contrary, they have quite a record of mocking and maligning. this is a history of selfishness, self-absorption, immaturity, and greed. and you will see how everyone who has come into contact with these four individuals has been abused, wronged, deceived and betrayed. this time, they have gone too far. this time they are going to be held accountable. this time, they are the ones who will pay. \\n\\nvandelay: mr. chiles. \\n\\nchiles: i am shocked and chagrined, mortified and stupefied. this trial is outrageous! it is a waste of the taxpayers\\' time and money. it is a travesty of justice that these four people have been incarcerated while the real perpetrator is walking around laughing - lying and laughing, laughing and lying. you know what these four people were? they were innocentbystanders. now, you just think about that term. innocent. bystanders. because that\\'s exactly what they were. we know theywere bystanders, nobody\\'s disputing that. so how can a bystander be guilty? no such thing. have you ever heard of a guilty bystander? no, because you cannot be a bystander and be guilty. bystanders are by definition, innocent. that is the nature of bystanding. but no, they want to change nature here. they want to create a whole new animal - the guilty bystander. don\\'t you let them do it. only you can stop them. \\n\\nvandelay: is the prosecution ready to present its first witness? \\n\\nhoyt: we are, your honor. call officer matt vogel to the stand. \\n\\nbailiff: call matt vogel. \\n\\nhoyt: so they were just standing there? \\n\\nvogel: yes. \\n\\nhoyt: did one of them have a video camera? \\n\\nvogel: yes. \\n\\nhoyt: your honor, with the court\\'s permission, we would like to play back that video and enter it into evidence as exhibit a. \\n\\nvandelay: proceed. \\n\\nvogel: don\\'t shoot. \\n\\njerry: well, there goes the money for the lipo. \\n\\nelaine: see, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it\\'s an easy getaway. they can\\'t really chase ya! \\n\\ngeorge: he\\'s actually doing him a favor. it\\'s less money for him to buy food. \\n\\n[new witness: the victim of the robbery] \\n\\nhoyt: so they just stood there and did nothing? \\n\\nvogel: yeah, nothing. nothing! \\n\\nhoyt: no further questions. \\n\\ngeorge: hey! great plane! thanks a lot. piece of junk. you know you almost got us killed! \\n\\nhoyt: call mabel choate to the stand. \\n\\nbailiff: call mabel choate. \\n\\nchiles: your honor. i most strenuously and vigorously object to this witness. she was not present at the time of the incident. her testimony is irrelevant, irrational, and inconsequential. \\n\\nhoyt: your honor, the prosecution has gone to great lengths and considerable cost to find these character witnesses.it is imperative that we establish this is not merely an isolated incident. it\\'s part of a pattern of anti-social behavior that\\'s been going on for years. \\n\\nvandelay: objection overruled. i\\'ll hear the witness. \\n\\nhoyt: now, mrs. choate, would you please tell the court what happen the evening of january 4th. \\n\\nchoate: well, i was in snitzer\\'s bakery when i got accosted by that man. \\n\\nhoyt: let the record show that she is pointing at mr. seinfeld. \\n\\nhoyt: what did he want? \\n\\nchoate: my marble rye. \\n\\nhoyt: your marble rye? \\n\\nchoate: i got the last one. he kept persisting, and i said no. \\n\\nhoyt: and then you left the bakery. \\n\\nchoate: that\\'s right. \\n\\nhoyt: but it didn\\'t end there, did it, mrs. choate? \\n\\nchoate: oh no. \\n\\njerry: gimme that rye. \\n\\nchoate: stop it. \\n\\njerry: i want that rye lady. \\n\\nchoate: help - someone help. \\n\\njerry: shut up, you old bag! \\n\\nhoyt: no further questions. \\n\\nhoyt: i call marla penny to the stand. \\n\\nbailiff: call marla penny. \\n\\njerry: the virgin! \\n\\nhoyt: and what was your connection to the defendants? \\n\\npenny: i dated mr. seinfeld for several weeks in the autumn of 1992. \\n\\nhoyt: then on the evening of october 28, there was an abrupt end to that relationship. tell us what happened. \\n\\npenny: it\\'s rather difficult to talk about. \\n\\nhoyt: it\\'s alright. take your time. \\n\\npenny: well, i became aware of a - \\n\\nhoyt: a what? \\n\\npenny: a, uh - \\n\\nhoyt: yes? \\n\\npenny: a contest. \\n\\nhoyt: contest? \\n\\npenny: yes. \\n\\nhoyt: what was the nature of the contest? \\n\\npenny: oh please, i can\\'t. \\n\\nhoyt: it\\'s okay. \\n\\npenny: the four of them made a wager to see if they could - \\n\\nhoyt: yes? \\n\\npenny: to see who could go the longest without gratifying themselves. \\n\\npeterman: for the love of god! \\n\\npenny: it was horrible, horrible! \\n\\nhoyt: call donald sanger to the stand. \\n\\njerry: who the hell is that?

\\n\\nbubble boy: that\\'s a joke - the moors. \\n\\ngeorge: oh no - i\\'m so sorry, it\\'s the moops. the correct answer is the moops. \\n\\nbubble boy: moops? let me see that. that\\'s not moops, you jerk. it\\'s moors. it\\'s a misprint. \\n\\ngeorge: sorry, the card says moops. \\n\\nbubble boy: it doesn\\'t matter. it\\'s moors - there\\'s no moops. \\n\\ngeorge: it\\'s moops. \\n\\nbubble boy: moors! \\n\\ngeorge: moops! \\n\\ngeorge: help! someone! \\n\\nbubble boy: there\\'s no moops, you idiot. \\n\\nsusan: stop it! let go of him! \\n\\nmrs. sanger: donald, stop it. no. donald, stop it. \\n\\ngeorge: it was moops. \\n\\nbubble boy: moors. \\n\\n[new witness: the lady kramer gave a defective wheelchair to in \"the handicapped spot\"] \\n\\nhoyt: so mr. costanza parked in a handicapped spot, and as a result you got in an accident, and your wheelchair was destroyed? \\n\\nlady: that\\'s right. \\n\\nhoyt: and then mr. kramer gave you a used wheelchair? \\n\\nlady: that\\'s right. \\n\\n[new witness: dr. wilcox, the doctor on duty when susan died] \\n\\nhoyt: so you were the doctor on duty the night susan ross died? \\n\\nwilcox: yes, that\\'s right. it was may 16, 1996. i\\'ll never forget it. \\n\\nhoyt: so you broke the news to mr. costanza? could you tell the court, please, what his reaction was? \\n\\nwilcox: i would describe it as restrained jubilation. \\n\\nmr. ross: murderer! \\n\\nmrs. ross: he killed our daughter! he knew those envelopes were toxic! \\n\\nvandelay: order in this court! \\n\\nhoyt: call sidra holland to the stand. \\n\\nchiles: whew! look at this one, she fine. you dated her? \\n\\nhoyt: so you met jerry seinfeld in a health club sometime in 1993? \\n\\nsidra: yes. \\n\\nhoyt: and you also met miss benes in that same health club? \\n\\nsidra: yes, that\\'s true. \\n\\nhoyt: would you describe the circumstances of that meeting. \\n\\nsidra: we were in the sauna, making chit-chat. \\n\\nsidra: you know, i\\'ve seen you around the club. my name\\'s sidra. this is marcie. \\n\\nelaine: oh, hi, i\\'m elaine. \\n\\nhoyt: so, she pretended to trip, and she fell into your breasts? \\n\\nsidra: yes. \\n\\nhoyt: why would she do something like that? \\n\\nsidra: because he sent her in there to find out if they were real. \\n\\n[new witness: joe bookman, library cop] \\n\\nhoyt: state your name. \\n\\nbookman: bookman, joe bookman. \\n\\nhoyt: and what\\'s your occupation?

i know it\\'s against the law. \\n\\nguard: i don\\'t know. \\n\\njerry: because i could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that\\'s why. \\n\\nhoyt: uromycitisis! i wonder if they\\'re having any trouble controlling themselves during this trial? perhaps these two hooligans would like to have a pee party right here in the courtroom! \\n\\nchiles: objection, your honor! this is completely inappropriate! my clients\\' medical condition is not on trial here! i refer you to the disability act of 1990. \\n\\nvandelay: sit down, mr. chiles. \\n\\n[new witness: police detective] \\n\\nhoyt: alright, detective, then what happened? \\n\\ndetective: we got a tip that a lot of prostitutes had been turning tricks in the parking lot. \\n\\nprostitute: you just cost me some money. \\n\\nkramer: cool it, lady. cool it. cool it, lady. cool it. \\n\\npolice: police officers - freeze right there! \\n\\nhoyt: so cosmo kramer was, in fact, a pimp. \\n\\n[witness: the low-talker from \"the puffy shirt\"] \\n\\nhoyt: so you asked mr. seinfeld if he would wear your puffy shirt on the today show? \\n\\nlow-talker: (mumbles) \\n\\nhoyt: excuse me? \\n\\nchiles: uh, excuse me, your honor, but what is the point of this testimony? this woman\\'s a low-talker. i can\\'t hear a word she\\'s saying. so either get some other kind of microphone up there, or let\\'s move on. \\n\\n[new witness: george steinbrenner] \\n\\nhoyt: call george steinbrenner to the stand. \\n\\nbailiff: call george steinbrenner. \\n\\nhoyt: so george costanza came to work for you in may of 1994?

\\n\\nsoup nazi: no! next question. \\n\\nhoyt: how do you know the defendants? \\n\\nsoup nazi: they used to come to my restaurant. \\n\\ngeorge: medium turkey chili. \\n\\njerry: medium crab bisque. \\n\\ngeorge: i didn\\'t get any bread. \\n\\njerry: just forget it. let it go. \\n\\ngeorge: um, excuse me, i think you forgot my bread. \\n\\nsoup nazi: you want bread? \\n\\ngeorge: yes, please. \\n\\nsoup nazi: three dollars! \\n\\ngeorge: what? \\n\\nsoup nazi: no soup for you! \\n\\nsoup nazi: but the idiot clowns did not know how to order. i banned that one - the woman - for a year. then one day, she came back. \\n\\nelaine: five cups chopped porcini mushrooms. half a cup of olive oil. three pounds celery. \\n\\nsoup nazi: that\\'s my recipe for wild mushroom. \\n\\nelaine: you\\'re through, soup nazi. pack it up. no more soup for you. next! \\n\\nsoup nazi: she published my recipes. i had to close the store, move to argentina. she ruined my business! \\n\\nelaine: soup\\'s not all that good anyway. \\n\\nsoup nazi: what did you say?! \\n\\nhoyt: the state calls mr. babu bhatt to the stand. \\n\\njerry: how did they find babu?

\\n\\nrivera: hi everybody, i\\'m geraldo rivera and welcome to this special edition of rivera live. well, arguments in the good samaritan trial ended today. the jury has been in deliberation for four and a half hours now. let\\'s go live to jane wells who is in latham, massachusetts, covering this trial for us. jane - \\n\\nwells: geraldo, just a few minutes ago, the jury asked to see the video tape. \\n\\nrivera: that\\'s the one where they are overheard making sarcastic remarks during the robbery. \\n\\nwells: yes, it\\'s a very incriminating piece of evidence. but i must tell you, geraldo, this courtroom and everyone who has attended this trial is still reeling from the endless parade of witness who have come forth so enthusiastically to testify against these four seemingly ordinary people. one even had the feeling that if judge vandelay didn\\'t finally put a stop to it, it could\\'ve gone on for months. \\n\\nrivera: jane, whose testimony do you think resonated most strongly with this jury? \\n\\nwells: that is so hard to say. certainly there\\'s the doctor with the poison invitations. the bubble boy was an extremely sympathetic and tragic figure. and that bizarre contest certainly didn\\'t sit well with this small town jury.there\\'s the woman they sold the defective wheelchair to, the deported pakistani restaurateur. geraldo, it just went on, and on, and on, into the night. \\n\\nrivera: and so we wait. \\n\\njerry: do they make you wear uniforms in prison? \\n\\nelaine: i think so. \\n\\njerry: it\\'s not that bright orange one is it? \\n\\nelaine: i hope it\\'s not that one, because i cannot wear orange. \\n\\nkramer: will you stop worrying? jackie\\'s going to get us off. he never loses. how about when he asked that cop if a black man had ever been to his house. did you see the look on his face? \\n\\nestelle: sorry to bother you, judge. \\n\\nvandelay: how did you get in here? \\n\\nestelle: please, if he\\'s found guilty, please be kind to him. he\\'s a good boy. \\n\\nvandelay: this is highly irregular. \\n\\nestelle: well, maybe there\\'s something i can do for you. \\n\\nvandelay: what do you mean? \\n\\nestelle: you know \\n\\nsidra: oh, jackie, you\\'re so articulate. \\n\\nchiles: we have plenty of time, too. this jury could be out for days. \\n\\nchiles: hello? damn. they\\'re ready. \\n\\njerry: hey elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was going down? \\n\\nelaine: i\\'ve always loved ... united airlines. \\n\\nkramer: i think it\\'s going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me. \\n\\njerry: maybe because she knows you\\'re going to jail. \\n\\nbailiff: all rise. \\n\\nvandelay: ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict? \\n\\nforeman: we have, your honor. \\n\\nvandelay: will the defendants please rise. and how do you find, with respect to the charge of criminal indifference? \\n\\nforeman: we find the defendants - guilty. \\n\\nvandelay: order! order in this court, i will clear this room! i do not know how, or under what circumstances the four of you found each other, but your callous indifference and utter disregard for everything that is good and decent has rocked the very foundation upon which our society is built. i can think of nothing more fitting than for the four of youto spend a year removed from society so that you can contemplate the manner in which you have conducted yourselves. i know i will. this court is adjourned. \\n\\ngeorge: you had to hop! you had to hop on the plane. \\n\\nelaine: puddy, don\\'t wait for me. \\n\\npuddy: alright. \\n\\nfrank: we gotta get out of here. we want to beat the traffic. \\n\\nsidra: come on, jackie. let\\'s go. \\n\\njerry: what? \\n\\nchiles: oh, and by the way, they\\'re real, and they\\'re spectacular. \\n\\njerry: well, it\\'s only a year. that\\'s not so bad. we\\'ll be out in a year, and then we\\'ll be back \\n\\nkramer: could be fun. don\\'t have to worry about your meals, or what you\\'re going to do saturday night. and they do shows. yeah, we could put on a show - maybe \"bye bye birdie\" or \"my fair lady\". elaine, you could be liza doolittle. \\n\\nelaine: why don\\'t you just blow it out your a... \\n\\nelaine: if i call jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones? \\n\\njerry: sure. \\n\\nelaine: cause you only get one call. the prison call is like the king of calls. \\n\\njerry: i think that would be a very nice gesture. \\n\\nkramer: i got it - it\\'s out! how about that, huh? oh, boy, what a relief. \\n\\njerry: see now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. \\n\\ngeorge: really? \\n\\njerry: oh yeah. the second button is the key button. it literally makes or breaks the shirt. look at it, it\\'s too high, it\\'s in no-man\\'s land. \\n\\ngeorge: haven\\'t we had this conversation before? \\n\\njerry: you think? \\n\\ngeorge: i think we have. \\n\\njerry: yeah, maybe we have. \\n\\njerry: so what is the deal with the yard? i mean when i was a kid my mother wanted me to play in the yard. but of course she didn\\'t have to worry about my next door neighbor tommy sticking a shiv in my thigh. and what\\'s with the lockdown? why do we have to be locked in our cells? are we that bad that we have to be sent to prison, in prison? you would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough. so, anyone from cellblock d? \\n\\nprisoner 1: i am. \\n\\njerry: i\\'ll talk slower. i\\'m kidding - i love cellblock d. my friend george is in cellblock d. what are you in for,sir? \\n\\nprisoner 2: murder one. \\n\\njerry: murder one? oooooo, watch out everybody. better be nice to you. i\\'m only kidding sir - lighten up. how about you, what are you in for? \\n\\nprisoner 3: grand theft auto. \\n\\njerry: grand theft auto - don\\'t steal any of my jokes. \\n\\nprisoner 3: you suck - i\\'m gonna cut you. \\n\\njerry: hey, i don\\'t come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of your hand. \\n\\nguard: alright, seinfeld, that\\'s it. let\\'s go. come on. \\n\\njerry: alright, hey, you\\'ve been great! see you in the cafeteria. \\n\\n'"
